Geraniol exhibits antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects comparable to antibiotics, effectively inhibiting pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli and S. aureus. Importantly, geraniol does not induce bacterial resistance after prolonged exposure, unlike traditional antibiotics. It also restores and preserves the host's microbial community, reduces drug residues in milk, and avoids disrupting beneficial microbiota. The findings support geraniol's potential as a safe, effective, and resistance-free antimicrobial agent in veterinary medicine, with broader implications for reducing antibiotic use and resistance development."
