  "abstract": "The status quo for combating uprising antibacterial resistance is to employ synergistic combinations of antibiotics. Nevertheless, the currently available combination therapies are fast becoming untenable. Combining antibiotics with various FDA-approved non-antibiotic drugs has emerged as a novel strategy against otherwise untreatable multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. The apex of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of antibacterial synergy of the combination of polymyxin B with the phenothiazines against the MDR Gram-negative pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The synergistic antibacterial effects were tested using checkerboard and static time-kill assays. Electron microscopy (EM) and untargeted metabolomics were used to ascertain the mechanism(s) of the antibacterial synergy. The combination of polymyxin B and the phenothiazines showed synergistic antibacterial activity in checkerboard and static time-kill assays at clinically relevant concentrations against both polymyxin-susceptible and polymyxin-resistant isolates. EM revealed that the polymyxin B-prochlorperazine combination resulted in greater damage to the bacterial cell compared to each drug monotherapy. In metabolomics, at 0.5\u00a0h, polymyxin B monotherapy and the combination (to a greatest extent) disorganised the bacterial cell envelope as manifested by a major perturbation in bacterial membrane lipids (glycerophospholipids and fatty acids), peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. At the late time exposure (4\u00a0h), the aforementioned effects (except LPS biosynthesis) perpetuated mainly with the combination therapy, indicating the disorganising bacterial membrane biogenesis is potentially behind the mechanisms of antibacterial synergy. In conclusion, the study highlights the potential usefulness of the combination of polymyxin B with phenothiazines for the treatment of polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative infections (e.g. CNS infections).",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntibiotic resistance has evolved as a serious global threat to mankind inevitably leading to increasing social and economic cost. The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned of the possibility of a post-antibiotic era where simple bacterial infections become untreatable [1]. According to a recent report of the World Health Organisation (WHO), multi-drug resistant (MDR) A. baumannii are amongst of the top priority pathogens that desperately require new antibiotic treatments [2]. These MDR pathogens often cause life-threatening nosocomial infections particularly in immuno-compromised and critically-ill patients, such as pneumonia and sepsis;[3], [4] and They can readily develop resistance to all available antibiotics including the last-resort polymyxins (i.e. polymyxin B and colistin, also known as polymyxin E) [5], [6], [7]. Colistin and polymyxin B are the cyclic lipopeptides which are comprised of an intra-molecular heptapeptide loop and a linear tripeptide side chain with a hydrophobic N-terminal fatty acyl group (Fig. 1). The intra-molecular heptapeptide ring is formed by the connection between the carboxyl group of the C-terminal threonine (L-Thr) residue at position 10 and amino group side chain of L-\u03b1,\u03b3-diaminobutyric acid (Dab) residue at the position 4 [8], [9]. It is postulated that polymyxins exert their antimicrobial action via direct interaction between the positively charges Dab residues and negatively charges lipid A component of the LPS which then enables the insertion of the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophobic moieties of amino acid 6 and 7 into the outer membrane to induce membrane expansion [10]. This event is thought to be followed by polymyxin-mediated fusion of the inner leaflets of the outer membrane and the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane surrounding the periplasmic space. The fusion causes phospholipid exchange and then, osmotic imbalance that eventually leads to cell death [10], [11], [12]. The most common mode of polymyxins resistance observed in A. baumannii is developed through at least two distinct mechanisms, namely, complete LPS loss or modification of lipid A via the introduction of phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) or aminoarabinose (Ara4N) moieties onto the phosphates of its lipid A component [13], [14], [15].Fig. 1The chemical structures for polymyxins and the phenothiazines drugs (prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and thiethylperazine) employed in this study.\nPhenothiazines were initially used in histochemistry for staining plasmodia and latter explored as an antimalaria in the late 1880s, and were used as antiparasitic and antibacterial drugs in livestock in the 1930s [16]. Latter derivatives such prochlorperazine, thiethylperazine and chlorpromazine were developed as antipsychotics to treat mania, psychotic depression, agitation, schizophrenia or as antiemetic drugs [17]. Phenothiazine itself was sprayed on orchards due to its high potency against apple maggot, corn borer, worms [16], [18]. In addition to the insecticidal activity of phenothiazine there was also a delay in the rotting of fruits, which indicated the potential antibacterial activity of the phenothiazine core [19]. This antibacterial activity was later utilised in the clinic to treat urinary tract infections [20]. Studies have shown antibacterial activity of different phenothiazine derivatives against Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. [21], [22], [23], [24]. Moreover, many phenothiazine derivatives such as thioridazine, chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine were found to have the ability to re-sensitize antibiotic-resistant bacteria (i.e. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes) [25]. Notably, there was a study in 1960 showing that a patient with tuberculosis was treated successfully by chlorpromazine therapy [26]. Overall, it is clear that phenothiazines have great potential as anti-infective agents either per se or in combination with other compounds.\nAn emerging \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 approach to combating polymyxin resistance is to repurpose FDA approved non-antibiotic drugs that present synergistic activity when combined with polymyxins [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Notably, the combination of chlorpromazine with the antifungal amphotericin B was synergistic against Cryptococcus neoformans\n[32]. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that the antibacterial effect of polymyxin B is synergistic in combination with non-antibiotic drugs such as closantel, ivacaftor, tamoxifen, raloxifene, toremifene, mitotane, and zidovudine [27], [28], [29], [30], [33], [34], [35]. The focus of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial synergy of phenothiazine neuroleptic drugs in combination with polymyxin B against a range of polymyxin resistant and susceptible Gram-negative isolates and investigate potential antimicrobial mode of action using untargeted metabolomics and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The presented findings highlight the effective synergy and clinical potential of this novel combination for the treatment of MDR polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative infections.\n\n## Synergy testing of polymyxin B \u2013 phenothiazine combinations: determination of MICs and FICs\nThe synergistic antimicrobial activity of polymyxin B and the phenothiazines (prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and thiethylperazine) monotherapy, and in combination was tested against a panel of clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae (Table 1). Overall, the polymyxin B and phenothiazine combinations showed synergistic activity against more than half of the strains tested. The combination of polymyxin B and prochlorperazine displayed a synergistic effect against 13 out of 22 P. aeruginosa isolates tested (including 12 out of 13 polymyxin B resistant isolates); 4 out of 6 A. baumannii isolates tested, and 2 out of 4\u00a0K. pneumoniae isolates tested. Polymyxin B and prochlorperazine monotherapies were found to be ineffective (MICs of both drugs ranging from 8 to\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L) against the polymyxin B resistant isolates. The polymyxin B and chlorpromazine combination demonstrated synergistic effect against 14 out of 22 P. aeruginosa isolates tested (including 12 out of 13 polymyxin B resistant strains); 1 out of 3 A. baumannii isolates tested, and 2 out of 3\u00a0K. pneumoniae isolates tested. Polymyxin B and chlorpromazine monotherapies were found to be ineffective (MICs of both drugs ranging from 8 to >128\u00a0mg/L) against the polymyxin B resistant isolates. Polymyxin B and thiethylperazine in combination showed a synergistic effect against 16 out of 22 P. aeruginosa isolates tested (including 12 out of 13 polymyxin B resistant strains); 2 out of 3 A. baumannii isolates tested, and 2 out of 3\u00a0K. pneumoniae isolates tested. Polymyxin B and thiethylperazine monotherapies were found to be ineffective (MICs of both drugs ranging from 8 to >128\u00a0mg/L) against all polymyxin B resistant isolates except for A. baumannii FADDI-AB065 wherein thiethylperazine monotherapy displayed low MIC 4\u00a0mg/L.Table 1Antimicrobial activity of polymyxin B (PMB), prochlorperazine (PCH), chlorpromazine (CHP) and thiethylperazine (THY) monotherapy, and in combination.MIC (mg/L)FIC indexdIsolatesPMBPCHCHPTHYPMB-PCHPMB-CHPPMB-THYPolymyxin-resistant isolatesP. aeruginosaFADDI-PA006 muca8>128>128>1280.270.270.26FADDI-PA09216>128>128>1280.280.190.28FADDI-PA067 n/ma (s)b16>128>128>1280.280.190.19FADDI-PA09332>128>128>1280.250.190.19FADDI-PA066 n/m32128>128>1280.250.270.13FADDI-PA11216>128>128>1280.190.310.31FADDI-PA070 n/m64128>128>1280.160.190.14FADDI-PA071 n/m>64>128>128>1280.10.140.16FADDI-PA016 n/m (L)b>64>128>128>1280.130.130.13FADDI-PA068 n/m>64>128>128>1280.130.080.14FADDI-PA063 muc>64>128>128>1280.130.080.06FADDI-PA072 n/m>64>128>128>1280.160.270.28FADDI-PA064 n/m>6464128320.6311Polymyxin-susceptible isolatesFADDI-PA002 muc0.125128>128>1280.530.50.27FADDI-PA005 n/m0.25128>128>1280.520.560.52FADDI-PA021 muc0.25>128128>1280.510.53FADDI-PA1111>128>128>1280.510.560.53FADDI-PA1170.5>128>128>1280.50.280.52FADDI-PA007 n/m0.5>128>128>1280.530.561FADDI-PA020 muc0.5>128>128>1280.530.560.28FADDI-PA0241>128>128>1280.260.560.27FADDI-PA019 muc1128>128>1280.520.310.27Polymyxin-resistant isolatesA. baumanniiFADDI-AB065>64884111FADDI-AB1488>128NAcNA0.13NANAFADDI-AB1448>128NANA0.13NANAPolymyxin-susceptible isolatesATCC 17,9780.5128NANA0.28NANAATCC 19,6061>128>128320.270.270.31FADDI-AB1460.56464320.510.510.27Polymyxin-susceptible isolatesK. pneumoniaeATCC 700,7210.125>128>128>1280.750.630.75Kp BM10.125>128NANA0.63NANAFADDI-KP0011>128>128>1280.380.250.19FADDI-KP0020.25>128>128>1280.250.130.25amuc, mucoid; n/m, nonmucoid.bS, small colony; L, large colony.cNA, not accessed.dFIC\u00a0=\u00a0FIC INDEX= (MIC polymyxin B in combination with phenothiazine/MIC polymyxin B monotherapy) + (MIC phenothiazine in combination with polymyxin B/MIC phenothiazine monotherapy); synergy FIC\u00a0<\u00a00.5 [green]; additivity FIC\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u20131.0 [yellow]; indifference FIC\u00a0=\u00a01\u20134 [not observed]; antagonism FIC\u00a0\u2265\u00a04 [not observed].\nTo investigate whether the synergy between polymyxin B and the phenothiazines is a result of the permeabilizing activity of polymyxin on the Gram-negative OM that enables the intracellular entry of phenothiazines to exert their action on their intracellular targets, polymyxin nonapeptide plus prochlorperazine treatment was utilised against one polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa strain (FADDI-PA070) and the polymyxin-susceptible strain P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Polymyxin nonapeptide is the deacylated amino derivative of polymyxin B that lacks the direct bactericidal activity but retains the OM permeabilizing activity. It is often employed as a sensitizer for hydrophobic antibiotics [36]. The polymyxin nonapeptide\u2013prochlorperazine combination was ineffective against P. aeruginosa FADDI-PA070, whereas showed an excellent synergy (FIC\u00a0=\u00a00.15) against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853.\n\n## Static time-kill studies\nThe antimicrobial activity of polymyxin B and prochlorperazine was further assessed in static time kill studies against polymyxin B-resistant P. aeruginosa strains, FADDI-PA070 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L) and FADDI-PA006 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L); polymyxin B-susceptible A. baumannii strains, A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L) and A. baumannii ATCC 17978 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L); and against polymyxin B-resistant A. baumannii strains FADDI-AB148 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L) and FADDI-AB144 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L) (Fig. 2). Clinically relevant concentrations of polymyxin B and prochlorperazine were assessed [37], [38]. Polymyxin B monotherapy showed insignificant killing activity against P. aeruginosa FADDI-PA070 as manifested by a\u00a0\u2264\u00a01 log10 CFU/mL decrease in bacterial counts compared with untreated controls across all the time points. Although, a higher killing curve was observed after polymyxin B monotherapy against P. aeruginosa FADDI-PA006 at early time points with a\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.0- log10 CFU/ml decrease in the bacterial burden, inconsistent regrowth was also observed, with only a 1.0- log10 CFU/ml difference compared to the control after 24\u00a0h. Against A. baumannii strains, polymyxin B per se did not display significant bacterial killing except for A. baumannii ATCC 17978 wherein>2 log10 CFU/mL decrease in bacterial counts compared with control was seen after polymyxin B monotherapy (Fig. 2). Prochlorperazine monotherapy displayed no antimicrobial activity against all the strains assessed during 24\u00a0h treatment, which was demonstrated by its comparable time kill curves compared with untreated controls (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the combination therapy of polymyxin B and prochlorperazine demonstrated more effective bacterial killing activity against all tested strains peaking at 4 and 8\u00a0h with an 4.0\u20136.0-log10 CFU/ml decrease in the bacterial burden compared to the control, which was sustained to an ~5.0-log10 CFU/ml (P. aeruginosa FADDI-PA006 and A. baumannii ATCC 17978) and ~2.5-log10 CFU/ml (P. aeruginosa FADDI-PA070 and A. baumannii ATCC 19606) decline after 24\u00a0h compared to the control (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Time kill curves for polymyxin B and prochlorperazine monotherapies and in combinations against polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa strains, FADDI-PA070 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L) and FADDI-PA006 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L); against polymyxin B-susceptible A. baumannii strains, ATCC 19606 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L) and ATCC 17978 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a00.5\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L); and against polymyxin B-resistant A. baumannii strains FADDI-AB148 and FADDI-AB144 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L for both strains).\n\n## Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy\nAmong Gram-negative species, P. aeruginosa are notoriously difficult to treat due to its a formidable outer membrane barrier [39]. Therefore, scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted to examine the effect of polymyxin B and prochlorperazine monotherapy and in combination on the cellular morphology of the polymyxin B resistant P. aeruginosa strain FADDI-PA070 at 2\u00a0h (Fig. 3). SEM images showed blebbing, protrusions and minor damage of the bacterial cell membrane under polymyxin B monotherapy. The bacterial cells looked \u2018dried out\u2019 with shrinkage under prochlorperazine monotherapy. The combination therapy resulted in blebbing, protrusions and extensive damage to the bacterial cell membrane, which appeared to result in the leakage of cellular contents. In the TEM images, blebbing, protrusions and cell membrane damage are observed under polymyxin B monotherapy. Shrinkage and vesicle formation are observed under prochlorperazine monotherapy. The combination therapy resulted in greater shrinkage of the bacterial cell with vesicle formation.Fig. 3Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images of polymyxin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate FADDI-PA070 (polymyxin B MIC\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0mg/L, prochlorperazine MIC\u00a0=\u00a0128\u00a0mg/L) treated with polymyxin B or prochlorperazine monotherapy and in combination.\n\n## Metabolomics analysis of \nA. baumannii ATCC 17978 was specifically selected for the metabolomics studies as polymyxin B-prochlorperazine combination displayed superior killing kinetics against this strain in the time kill studies. Across all treatment conditions a total of 986 putatively identified metabolites were obtained, including: 39 metabolites in carbohydrate metabolism; 124 metabolites in amino acid metabolism; 231 metabolites in peptides metabolism; 46 metabolites in nucleotide metabolism and 206 in lipid metabolism. The Multivariate Data Analysis using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the significant metabolites affected by the treatment conditions (\u22650.58-log2-fold; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The reproducibility of all sample groups was acceptable across both time points (0.5 and 4\u00a0h), where the median RSD across all time points was (16\u201319%) for untreated (control) groups and (17\u201326%) for treated samples, consistent with some baseline variability in the dynamics of ordinary bacterial metabolism with and without antibiotic treatment (Table S1). Notably, the PCA plots showed that the untreated control and combination treated samples were significantly separated across all the time points 0.5 and 4\u00a0h (Figure S1). Polymyxin B and combination treatments were overlapped across all exposure times which suggested the polymyxin B was the initial driving force behind the combination treatment; whereas prochlorperazine closely resembled the untreated control samples in particular at 0.5\u00a0h (Figure S1). Similarly, the heatmaps reflected the aforementioned differences between the treated groups and untreated (control) groups (Figure S2). The combination treatment perturbed 387 (0.5\u00a0h) and 221 (4\u00a0h) significant metabolites; whereas polymyxin B monotherapy induced far less perturbations in particular at 4\u00a0h, with only 53 significantly perturbed metabolites. Prochlorperazine monotherapy showed a latent effect, significantly perturbing only 12 significant metabolites at 4\u00a0h (Figure S3). The combination treatment induced 185 and 181 unique significant metabolites at 0.5 and 4\u00a0h, respectively (Figure S4). The classification analysis of the significantly impacted metabolites illustrated that amino acids, peptides, lipids, nucleotides and carbohydrates were largely perturbed (mainly decreased) compared to cofactor, vitamin and energy metabolism; which were less significantly impacted after combination treatment (Figure S5). This pattern was observed across both time points 0.5 and 4\u00a0h (Figure S5A and B). Similarly, but to a lesser extent polymyxin B monotherapy produced a similar scenario wherein lipids, amino acids and carbohydrates were the impacted metabolite classes (Figure S5A and B). In contrast, prochlorperazine monotherapy caused an elevation in the levels of amino acid and peptides intermediates at 4\u00a0h (Fig. 5B).\n\n## Analyses of glycerophospholipid and fatty metabolism perturbations\nAt 0.5\u00a0h the combination treatment induced significantly more perturbations across all lipid classes (i.e. fatty acids and glycerophospholipids [e.g. phosphatidylethanolamine, PE; phosphatidylserine, PS; phosphatidylglycerol, PG]) compared to the polymyxin B and prochlorperazine monotherapies (Fig. 4A). Notably, alterations in glycerophospholipid levels were overrepresented compared to other lipid classes such as fatty acids after combination treatment. Among the glycerophospholipids, the lysophospholipids (LPLs) e.g. lysophosphatidylethanolamines underwent a dramatic decline following combination treatment, notably lysoPE(16:1) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-6.1), lysoPE(18:1) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.3) and lysoPE(0:0/14:0) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.3). Furthermore, essential precursors of bacterial membrane lipids such as sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine were markedly decreased following combination treatment (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.1) (Fig. 4A). Likewise, fundamental fatty acids which are involved in fatty acid elongation and degradation underwent significant changes following combination treatment, notably trans-hexadec-2-enoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-3.4), trans-tetradec-2-enoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-3.9), dodecanoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-4.1) and 2E-dodecenoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-7.8) (Fig. 4A). The impact of polymyxin B monotherapy was less than the combination treatment at 0.5\u00a0h; and there were greater perturbations in glycerophospholipids compared to fatty acids (Fig. 4A). Fatty acid elongation and degradation metabolites were among the most significantly impacted lipids after polymyxin B monotherapy, including 2E-dodecenoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-7.8), trans-tetradec-2-enoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-4.1) and trans-hexadec-2-enoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-3.9) (Fig. 4A). Prochlorperazine monotherapy did not induce any significant effect on lipid metabolism at 0.5\u00a0h.Fig. 4Perturbations of bacterial lipids.

Lipid names are putatively assigned based on accurate mass (\u22650.58553-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).

Notably, the levels of bacterial membrane lysophosphatidylethanolamines were decreased after combination treatment, including lysoPE(16:0) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-2.1), lysoPE(16:1) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.6), lysoPE(18:1) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.5) and lysoPE(18:2) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.5) (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the impact on fatty acid elongation was sustained following the combination therapy as manifested by a significant decline in the abundance of palmitoyl-CoA, trans-tetradec-2-enoyl-CoA, hexadecanoate, tetradecanoyl-CoA and octanoyl-CoA (>-1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 4B). Similar pattern was seen on fatty acid intermediates which underwent a marked decrease in their abundance after the combination treatment, such as FA (14:1) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.2), FA methyl(14:0) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.1), FA methyl(16:0) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.1) and tetradecanoic acid (myristic acid) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-0.93) (Fig. 4B).\nIn comparison, polymyxin B monotherapy impact at 4\u00a0h has started to fade away with only slight perturbation on fatty acid elongation and degradation intermediates, namely 3-cis-dodecenoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a02.7), 11E-tetradecenoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.5), palmitoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.6) and oleoyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-3.0) (Fig. 4B). Not unlike the effects at 0.5\u00a0h, no significant changes in lipid metabolism [except for hexadecanoate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-0.74)] were observed following prochlorperazine monotherapy at 4\u00a0h (Fig. 4B).\n\n## Analyses of perturbations in peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharides and lysine biosynthesis; amino-sugar and sugar-nucleotide metabolism; the pentose phosphate pathway\nSeveral metabolites related to amino-sugar, sugar-nucleotide metabolism; the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and its downstream peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lysine biosynthesis pathways were significantly perturbed at 0.5 and 4\u00a0h post treatment with the combination (Fig. 5A-C). At 0.5\u00a0h after combination treatment, three essential precursors of amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism were significantly decreased, namely D-glucosamine-6-phosphate, UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and UDP-N-acetylmuramate (>-4-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 5A&B). As a downstream consequence, the combination treatment also caused a marked decline in the abundance of fundamental peptidoglycan building blocks (i.e. which the amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar pathways feed into), including UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-\u03b3-glutamyl-meso-2,6-diaminopimelate, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate-D-alanine, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-6-carboxy-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine and D-alanyl-D-alanine (>-1.5-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 5B). A dramatic decline in the abundance of common intermediates of the LPS biosynthetic pathway (D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate) and pentose phosphate pathway (D-sedoheptulose-7-phosphate) were also seen following combination therapy at 0.5\u00a0h (>3.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 5B). Simultaneously, the abundance of two precursors of lysine metabolism was also undergoing a significant decrease following the combination treatment at 0.5\u00a0h, namely N6-acetyl-L-lysine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-3.6) and 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.5) (Fig. 5C).\nAt 0.5\u00a0h, although polymyxin B monotherapy significantly perturbed the main pathways involved in the bacterial cell envelope biogenesis, it was less potent than the combination therapy (Fig. 5B&C). The levels of three amino-sugar and sugar-nucleotide intermediates underwent a substantial decrease after polymyxin B monotherapy at 0.5\u00a0h, namely D-glucosamine-6-phosphate, UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and UDP-N-acetylmuramate (>-2.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 5B). Peptidoglycan biosynthesis was also significantly disrupted after polymyxin B monotherapy wherein the levels of four essential intermediates experienced a significant decline, including UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-\u03b3-glutamyl-meso-2,6-diaminopimelate, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-2,6 diaminoheptanedioate-D-alanine, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-6-carboxy-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine and D-alanyl-D-alanine (>-1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 5B). Not unlike the combination treatment, albeit, to a lesser extent, polymyxin B monotherapy induced a marked decrease in the levels of PPP intermediate (D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate) and the LPS biosynthesis precursor (D-glycero-D-manno-heptose-7-phosphate) (>-2.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 5B). Only N6-acetyl-L-lysine of lysine metabolism experienced a significant reduction in its level after polymyxin B monotherapy (>-2.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 5C). Prochlorperazine monotherapy did not show any significant effects at 0.5\u00a0h.\nDifferent patterns of perturbation were seen at 4\u00a0h wherein the combination therapy displayed more profound impact on peptidoglycan and lysine biosynthesis with unnoticeable impact on LPS biosynthesis (Fig. 5B&C). The levels of seven principle building blocks of peptidoglycan biosynthesis were significantly perturbed, namely UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate-D-alanine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a00.75), UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-6-carboxy-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.32), D-alanine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-0.98), N-acetylglucosamine-1,6-anhydro-N-acetyl-\u03b2-muramic acid (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a02.3), meso-2,6-diamino-3-hydroxypimelate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a01.7), meso-2,6-diaminopimelic acid and (Ac)2-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a02.3) (Fig. 5B). Likewise, the combination treatment induced marked changes in the abundance of five essential lysine biosynthetic intermediates, including N6-acetyl-L-lysine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a01.7), N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxy-L-lysine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a01.5), 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.3), N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.3) and L-2-aminoadipate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.0) (Fig. 5C). In contrast, at 4\u00a0h, polymyxin B monotherapy did not exhibit a noticeable influence on peptidoglycan and LPS biosynthesis; however, far less perturbation on lysine metabolism was observed wherein the level of N6-acetyl-L-lysine was declined after polymyxin B monotherapy (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.4) (Fig. 5C). Similarly, there was no significant impact on peptidoglycan, LPS and lysine biosynthesis following prochlorperazine monotherapy at 4\u00a0h.\n\n## Analyses of perturbations in arginine and proline metabolism\nThe amino acids L-glutamate, L-ornithine, L-arginine and proline are key regulators of bacterial polyamine (i.e. putrescine and spermidine) metabolism as well as serving as a source of carbon and/or nitrogen [40], [41]. A high number of metabolites involved in arginine and proline metabolism were significantly altered following combination treatment at 0.5 and 4\u00a0h (Fig. 6A-C). At 0.5\u00a0h, the abundance of ten principle intermediates of arginine and proline metabolism were diminished [except (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a04.5)] by the combination treatment, including L-glutamate, L-glutamine, L-ornithine, N-acetyl-L-glutamate, N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde, N-succinyl-L-glutamate, N2-succinyl-L-ornithine and N2-succinyl-L-arginine (\u2265-1.5-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 6A&B). Similarly but to a lesser extent, polymyxin B monotherapy caused a significant inhibitory effect [ except (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a03.5) ] on seven main precursors of arginine and proline metabolism at 0.5\u00a0h, namely L-glutamate, L-ornithine, N-acetyl-L-glutamate, N-succinyl-L-glutamate, N2-succinyl-L-ornithine and N2-succinyl-L-arginine (\u2265-1.5-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 6B). At 0.5\u00a0h, no significant effect was observed in the samples treated with prochlorperazine monotherapy except of N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde which underwent a significant decrease in its abundance (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-0.92).Fig. 6The graph shown the significantly impact metabolites of fatty acids metabolism for A. baumannii ATCC 17978 after 0.5\u00a0h treatment with polymyxin B (PMB), prochlorperazine (PCH) and the combination (COM) (A). Bar charts for the significantly impacted metabolites of fatty acid metabolism after treatment with polymyxin B (PMB) or prochlorperazine (PCH) monotherapy and the combination (COM) at 0.5\u00a0h (B) and 4\u00a0h (C) (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05; FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).\nAt 4\u00a0h, the aforementioned effects had continued as a result of the combination treatment which produced a significant perturbation in six essential precursors of arginine and proline metabolism, namely (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a02.5), N2-succinyl-L-arginine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-3.4), N-acetyl-L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.7), L-arginine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a00.61), N-acetylornithine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.2) and N-acetyl-L-citrulline (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a01.8) (Figure C). Notably, polymyxin B monotherapy impact on arginine and proline metabolism had begun to subside at 4\u00a0h except for the inhibitory effect on the abundance of N-succinyl-L-glutamate (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.7) (Figure C). Likewise, prochlorperazine per se induced a considerable decline in the level of only one arginine and proline metabolism intermediate N-acetyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-0.8) (Figure C).\n\n## Analyses of perturbations of the acetyl-CoA pathway\nThe acetyl-CoA is an essential cofactor which ac",
