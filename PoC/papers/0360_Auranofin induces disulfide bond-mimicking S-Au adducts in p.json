  "abstract": "Auranofin is an inhibitor of human thioredoxin reductase, clinically used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. More recently, it has been shown to possess strong antibacterial activity. Despite the structural dissimilarity and the independent evolutionary origins of human thioredoxin reductase and its bacterial counterpart (TrxB), inhibition of bacterial thioredoxin reductase is often suggested to be a major factor in auranofin's antibacterial mode of action. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to determine the mechanism of inhibition of auranofin for bacterial TrxB in the presence of thioredoxin, TrxB's natural substrate. However, the data obtained in these experiments was not consistent with a specific and exclusive interaction between TrxB and auranofin. Instead, it suggested that auranofin directly interacts with the cysteine thiols in thioredoxin, TrxB's substrate. Using the fluorescent redox protein roGFP2, we showed that auranofin does indeed directly interact with cysteine pairs in proteins, forming a thiol modification that is similar to, but clearly distinct from a disulfide bond. The Au:protein stoichiometries of auranofin-treated roGFP2 and thioredoxin strongly suggest the presence of an S-Au-S bridge between two cysteines in those proteins. These S-Au adducts form independent of thioredoxin reductase at a rate that indicates their pertinence in auranofin's antibacterial mode of action.",

  "full_text": "## In a reconstituted bacterial thioredoxin system, auranofin is not a specific inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase\nThioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is the target of auranofin in mammalian cells (5). Similarly, bacterial thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) is presumed to be a target, and TrxB\u2019s inhibition is thought to be the major cause of its antibacterial activity (11). TrxBs from Gram-positive species are inhibited by auranofin at nanomolar levels of the inhibitor in\u00a0vitro (10, 11, 16). We, as well, have recently shown that TrxBs of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are already fully inhibited by stochiometric amounts of auranofin (17). However, in this assay, we used 5,5\u2032-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (DTNB), a relatively poor substrate of bacterial TrxB (26, 27). Thus, to learn more about the nature of the inhibition, we revisited our TrxB activity assay, this time using its native substrate bacterial thioredoxin (TrxA). Our enzymatic reactions contained TrxB at 50\u00a0nM, NADPH at 400\u00a0\u03bcM, well above the reported Km of TrxB for NADPH at 1.2 to 2.69\u00a0\u03bcM to ensure pseudo-first order reaction conditions (28, 29, 30), DTNB at 2\u00a0mM, and TrxA at concentrations ranging from 0 to 6\u00a0\u03bcM. Activity, as measured by 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) release from DTNB, was dependent on the concentration of TrxA, and we observed a Km of TrxB for TrxA of 1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23\u00a0\u03bcM in the reconstituted Escherichia coli thioredoxin system and a Km of 1.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0\u03bcM of TrxB for TrxA in the reconstituted Bacillus subtilis system (Fig.\u00a01).Figure\u00a01Auranofin inhibition of bacterial TrxB is attenuated by thioredoxin. Purified ecTrxB or bsTrxB (50\u00a0nM) were preincubated with 200\u00a0\u03bcM NADPH and increasing concentrations of ecTrxA or bsTrxA in the absence (0\u00a0\u03bcM) or presence of various concentrations of auranofin (0.25\u20131\u00a0\u03bcM). Reactions were initiated by adding 2\u00a0mM DTNB and additional 200\u00a0\u03bcM NADPH. Reaction progress was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the liberated TNB chromophore at 412\u00a0nm. Michaelis\u2013Menten plots [initial velocity of reaction (v0 [\u03bcM/min]) versus substrate concentration (TrxA [\u03bcM])] of (A) ecTrxB and (B) bsTrxB activity are shown. Attempted fittings of the data for kinetics measured in the presence of auranofin are included to illustrate non-Michaelis\u2013Menten behavior in the presence of inhibitor. C, pre-incubation of Bacillus subtilis TrxB with 1\u00a0\u03bcM auranofin in the presence of NADPH substantially increased inhibition of TrxB, (10\u00a0min 1\u00a0\u03bcM AF) when compared to simultaneous addition of TrxA and auranofin (1\u00a0\u03bcM AF), as measured by the initial conversion of DTNB in the presence of 6\u00a0\u03bcM TrxA. However, during the time of measurement, the velocity increased slightly (D), suggesting that TrxA can remove gold already bound to TrxB. The average and SD of three replicates is shown. For the underlying data, refer to supplementary material S1.\nNext, we wanted to determine the inhibitor constant for auranofin for ecTrxB (Fig.\u00a01A) and bsTrxB (Fig.\u00a01B) by adding varying concentrations of auranofin to our enzymatic assay. However, this inhibition assay did not follow any pattern that would be expected if thioredoxin reductase was the only target of auranofin in our assay. In our previous assay, in the absence of thioredoxin, we saw full inhibition of TrxB already at equimolar concentrations of the inhibitor (17). However, now, in the presence of thioredoxin, we had to use concentrations substantially above the equimolar (50\u00a0nM TrxB) concentration to observe meaningful enzyme inhibition, especially at higher concentrations of thioredoxin. Additionally, any time we reached auranofin concentrations above the concentration of the substrate thioredoxin present in a given reaction, we achieved almost complete inhibition of TrxB activity. Inspection of our inhibition curves in Figure\u00a01, panels a and b, reveals that, at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcM auranofin, discernible activity is only observed at TrxA concentrations at or above 1\u00a0\u03bcM and similarly at concentrations of 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM auranofin and TrxA concentrations at or above 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively.\nBased on these observations, we suspected that auranofin is binding to TrxA directly, as has been suggested by others (8). Due to TrxA\u2019s relatively high concentration as substrate in comparison to TrxB, it then attenuated the inhibition of the catalyst in a stoichiometric manner. Due to this unexpected behavior of auranofin, we could not deduce an inhibitor constant or a mechanism of inhibition from this data and had to dismiss our initial hypothesis that auranofin is a specific inhibitor of bacterial TrxB.\nWe then tested, if TrxA could remove the gold, from auranofin, already bound to TrxB. For this, we pre-incubated B.\u00a0subtilis TrxB with NADPH and auranofin as before, but this time in the absence of TrxA. We then added 6\u00a0\u03bcM TrxA at the start of our assay, together with DTNB. Inhibition was much stronger under these conditions (Fig.\u00a01C); however, we did observe a slight increase in velocity over time, suggesting that TrxA could remove gold bound to TrxB, thereby re-activating it (Fig.\u00a01D).\n\n## Auranofin inhibits thioredoxin directly\nTo test if auranofin interacts with TrxA directly, we used TrxA from E.\u00a0coli and B.\u00a0subtilis in a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase assay. Thioredoxin is known to facilitate the reduction of insulin (31). We used a variant of this classical insulin reduction assay (32) to check this inherent activity of TrxA in the presence of auranofin. In our assay, ecTrxA or bsTrxA were added as the reducing agent, and the velocity of insulin reduction was monitored spectrofluorometrically (Fig.\u00a02). Adding stoichiometric amounts of auranofin led to a significant attenuation of insulin reduction. ecTrxA treated with auranofin at equimolar concentrations was 51% slower than untreated ecTrxA, while autranofin-treated bsTrxA was 74.6% slower. When we pre-incubated TrxA with auranofin for 10\u00a0min, we could almost completely inhibit its insulin reduction activity, suggesting that thioredoxin\u2019s thiol pair reacts swiftly with auranofin but not fast enough to inhibit its activity completely when added at the same time as the substrate (Fig.\u00a02). These results corroborate our previous observation, and both results combined suggest that direct binding of auranofin or gold(I) to thioredoxin is the cause of the attenuation of the inhibition of bacterial thioredoxin reductase TrxB.Figure\u00a02FITC-insulin reduction by bacterial thioredoxins. Insulin reduction velocity of Escherichia coli TrxA (ecTrxA UT) and Bacillus subtilis TrxA (bsTrxA UT) is shown. One micromolar of purified TrxAs was added to 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml FITC-labeled insulin and 1\u00a0\u03bcM of auranofin (AF) was simultaneously added as inhibitor (ecTrxA\u00a0+\u00a0AF, bsTrxA\u00a0+\u00a0AF) or TrxA was pre-incubated for 10\u00a0min with 1\u00a0\u03bcM of auranofin before addition to the assay buffer (ecTrxA 10\u00a0min AF, bsTrxA 10\u00a0min AF). Turnover was followed in a fluorescence spectrophotometer and the maximal velocity over 250\u00a0s was plotted. Mean, SD, and individual data points obtained from independent triplicates are shown. Significance (p-value) calculated using student\u2019s t test and shown above the compared data points. For raw data, refer to supplementary material S2.\n\n## Auranofin induces a modification that mimics a disulfide bond but is still reactive towards iodoacetamide\nDue to gold\u2019s propensity to react with thiol sulfur, we hypothesized that the site of auranofin-binding in TrxA are the cysteines in the hallmark active site CXXC motif. In order to observe auranofin\u2019s interaction with cysteines directly, we used roGFP2 as a molecular probe. roGFP2 is a genetically engineered variant of GFP, which contains two cysteines that can be oxidized to form a disulfide bond (33). The fluorescence behavior of roGFP2 is contingent on the redox state of these two cysteines, and based on the ratio of two particular bands in roGFP2\u2019s excitation spectrum, its redox state can be determined. Thus, we suspected that roGFP2 could be a useful probe to monitor the interaction between auranofin and protein thiols. And indeed, adding auranofin to roGFP2 at a 1:10\u00a0molar excess led to a rapid spectral change (Fig.\u00a03, A and B), highly similar to the spectral change observed when adding the well-characterized thiol-oxidant AT-2 (Aldrithiol-2, 2,2\u2032-Dithiopyridin) (Fig.\u00a03C). Like the change induced by AT-2, it is reversible by the thiol reductant DTT (Fig.\u00a03, B and C). We thus hypothesized that auranofin introduces a disulfide bond in roGFP2. To confirm this direct interaction, we pretreated roGFP2 with iodoacetamide. Iodoacetamide is highly effective in blocking reduced thiols by carbamidomethylation. This \u201clocks\u201d roGFP2 in a pseudo-reduced state (Fig.\u00a03D), which no longer reacts with the thiol-oxidant AT-2 (Fig.\u00a03D). Similarly, auranofin can no longer change the fluorescence properties of iodoacetamide-treated roGFP2 (Fig.\u00a03D), confirming that, like the thiol oxidant AT-2, auranofin requires free thiols to react with roGFP2. While iodoacetamide reacts with free thiols, it cannot react with thiols engaged in a disulfide bond. Adding iodoacetamide to disulfide bond\u2013containing roGFP2, thus, does not change its fluorescent properties (Fig.\u00a03E). Surprisingly, adding iodoacetamide to auranofin-treated roGFP2 significantly changes its fluorescent properties back to that of its pseudo-reduced carbamidomethylated form (Fig.\u00a03F). Taken together, this shows that the chemical alteration induced in roGFP2 by auranofin mimics a disulfide bond based on roGFP2\u2019s spectral properties, but is chemically distinct, as it still possesses the ability to react with iodoacetamide.Figure\u00a03Changes in the fluorescent spectra of roGFP2 treated with auranofin, AT-2, and the thiol-blocking agent iodoacetamide.A, OxD of reduced roGFP2, treated with a 10-fold molar excess of auranofin (AF, indicated by a red arrow), and re-reduced with a 100-fold excess of DTT (indicated by a green arrow), demonstrating reversibility. B, spectral endpoints of the data presented in (A). C, a similar observation could be made when reduced roGFP2 was treated with a 10-fold molar excess of AT-2 and then re-reduced with a 100-fold molar excess of DTT. D, reduced roGFP2 was treated with a 1000-fold molar excess of iodoacetamide (IAM) to block all free thiols, and both AT-2 and AF were no longer able to induce a spectral change. E, roGFP2 treated with a 10-fold molar excess of AT-2 was no longer susceptible to the addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of IAM. F, however, roGFP2 treated with a 10-fold molar excess of AF returned to its pseudo-reduced state when treated with a 1000-fold molar excess of IAM. B\u2013F, representative data shown, experiments were performed in independent duplicates (B, C) or triplicates (D, E, F). Spectra of untreated roGFP2 in (B) and (F) are identical, as they were derived from the same experiment day and are repeated for illustrative purposes. The same applies to roGFP2- and AT-2\u2013treated roGFP2 in panels (C) and (E). For underlying data, please refer to supplementary material S3.\n\n## Auranofin forms a gold adduct in cysteine-containing proteins\nThe above data using roGFP2 showed that auranofin induced a thiol-modification similar to, but clearly distinct from, a disulfide bond. We thus speculated that the gold atom in auranofin could form a direct adduct with thiol pairs present in proteins. We used ICP-OES to determine if gold is bound directly to cysteine thiols in roGFP2. In our experiment, we treated roGFP2 with auranofin and removed excess auranofin by gel filtration. Fluorescence spectrometry confirmed the successful modification of roGFP2 (Fig.\u00a04A), and the auranofin-treated roGFP2 protein contained Au in a 1:0.7\u00a0molar ratio (protein to gold), consistent with an equimolar modification (Fig.\u00a04B). roGFP2 pretreated with iodoacetamide before treatment with auranofin did not contain gold (Fig.\u00a04B), in line with the spectral properties recorded (Fig.\u00a04A). Treatment of auranofin-modified roGFP2 with iodoacetamide led to a substantial loss of gold, again in line with our previous data and the spectra recorded (Figs.\u00a03F and 4A). We thus concluded that auranofin-treated roGFP2 forms a 1 to 1 complex (protein to gold) with Au, potentially as an S-Au-S bridge between the two structurally adjacent cysteines in roGFP2.Figure\u00a04Au binding to cysteine-containing proteins.A, fluorescence spectra of roGFP2 samples subjected to ICP-OES analysis. ICP-OES analysis of (B) roGFP2 and (C) ecTrxA treated with auranofin (AF) and AF combined with IAM in the order indicated (+IAM\u00a0+\u00a0AF: IAM first, then AF,\u00a0+AF\u00a0+\u00a0IAM: AF first, then IAM). Proteins were subjected to a 10-fold molar excess of AF and a 1000-fold molar excess of IAM, where indicated. Excess AF was removed by gel-filtration. In the solutions analyzed, roGFP2 had a concentration of 350\u00a0nM\u00a0(B), while ecTrxA was present at a concentration of 200\u00a0nM (C) (indicated by dashed lines). AF, in the absence of protein, was subjected to gel-filtration to control for carry over of gold (only AF), buffer without protein or AF (only buffer), and the analytical grade nitric acid used (acid blank) were analyzed as contamination controls. Controls are displayed in both panels (B, C) for illustrative purposes. Underlying fluorescence and ICP-OES data can be found in supplementary material S4.\nNext, we asked ourselves if this was a peculiar property of roGFP2 or if this modification can also be found in TrxA, as we made our initial observations with this protein. Thus, we performed a similar experiment using ecTrxA. The ICP-OES data obtained with ecTrxA parallels the data obtained with roGFP2: auranofin treatment led to a 1:0.8 stoichiometry between protein and Au, which could be prevented by prior blocking of ecTrxA\u2019s cysteines with iodoacetamide. More importantly, Au binding could be reversed by a subsequent reaction with iodoacetamide, confirming that ecTrxA, too, does not form a disulfide bond but a disulfide bond-mimicking Au adduct, which explains its inhibition by auranofin (Fig.\u00a04C).\n\n## Auranofin-induced S-Au adducts in proteins are a substrate for thioredoxin\nNext, we were wondering if the disulfide-mimicking thiol modification in proteins is, in principle, reversible by the antioxidant machinery available to a living cell. Thus, we treated auranofin-modified roGFP2 with rising concentrations of the thiol-reductase thioredoxin (Fig.\u00a05). When reduced TrxA from E.\u00a0coli was added to auranofin-modified roGFP2, we were able to monitor roGFP2\u2019s fluorescence properties return to those of reduced roGFP2, suggesting that the gold-adduct in auranofin-treated proteins acts as a direct substrate of the thiol-disulfide reductase thioredoxin. Presumably, like a disulfide bond in a thioredoxin substrate protein, the S-Au-S bridge is transferred from the substrate protein onto thioredoxin.Figure\u00a05Removal of S-Au adducts from roGFP2 with ecTrxA. The oxidation degree (OxD) of roGFP2 treated with auranofin was evaluated fluorometrically. After stabilization of the signal, ecTrxA was added to the assay at the molar excess indicated, and OxD was monitored for a total of 1h. An arrow indicates the time point when ecTrxA was added. Experiments were performed in duplicates; average and range are displayed. The underlying spectral data can be found in supplementary material S5.\n\n## Discussion\nHere, we present a series of experiments elucidating the interaction between auranofin and cysteine pair-containing proteins, namely bacterial thioredoxin from E.\u00a0coli and B.\u00a0subtilis, and the thiol-redox probe protein roGFP2. Our data suggests that, in addition to inhibiting bacterial thioredoxin reductase TrxB, auranofin readily reacts with cysteine pairs present in thioredoxin reductase\u2019s substrate thioredoxin and other proteins. Auranofin should, therefore, not be considered a specific inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase in bacteria.\nIn reconstituted bacterial thioredoxin systems, we observed Km values of TrxB for TrxA in E.\u00a0coli of 1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23\u00a0\u03bcM, similar to values found by others ranging from 2.8 to 3.68\u00a0\u03bcM (28, 29, 30). In B. subtilis, the Km was 1.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0\u03bcM, comparable to a value reported elsewhere with a Km of 4.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58\u00a0\u03bcM (34). With these Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics established, we added varying concentrations of auranofin to our assays. And while auranofin\u2019s inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent, our data did not conform to a typical inhibition process, preventing us from determining auranofin\u2019s Ki and from obtaining meaningful insights into the mechanism of inhibition. Instead, thioredoxin itself seemed to attenuate TrxB inhibition in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant inhibition of TrxB observed when auranofin concentrations exceeded the concentration of TrxA.\nIn contrast, Owings et\u00a0al. reported an IC50 of 88\u00a0nM for auranofin for Helicobacter pylorii TrxB in the presence of E.\u00a0coli TrxA (12) and Harbut et\u00a0al. reported IC50 values of 63\u00a0nM and 90\u00a0nM for thioredoxin reductases TrxB2 from M.\u00a0tuberculosis and TrxB from S.\u00a0aureus repectively, both in the presence of M.\u00a0tuberculosis thioredoxin TrxC (11). Owings et\u00a0al. used TrxA at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcM, well above their reported IC50 of 88\u00a0nM for auranofin, and Harbut et\u00a0al. used TrxC at even higher concentrations of up to 50\u00a0\u03bcM, findings that seemingly contradict our observations: in our experiments, no or very little inhibition was observed when auranofin was used at concentrations below the concentration of thioredoxin. However, both groups did not preincubate thioredoxin reductase, NADPH, and auranofin with thioredoxin. Rather, they initiated the reaction by the addition of thioredoxin or thioredoxin, NADPH, and DTNB. This is a sensible approach, when working under the assumption that auranofin exclusively interacts with TrxB. But should there be an additional formation of a thioredoxin-Au adduct, the transfer reaction of the Au adduct in TrxB to thioredoxin might not have been in equilibrium at the beginning of their enzymatic assay, leading to inhibition at the outset of the reaction, which is then diminished over time.\nOur speculation that auranofin interacts with TrxA was confirmed in thioredoxin activity assays determining TrxA\u2019s ability to reduce FITC-labeled insulin. Both ecTrxA\u2019s and bsTrxA\u2019s ability to reduce insulin was significantly inhibited in the presence of auranofin. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that TrxB inhibition is not the most relevant aspect of auranofin\u2019s antibacterial mode of action, given that proteomic studies suggest that in E.\u00a0coli and B. subtilis, the molar concentration of TrxA is 4.6 and 17.8 times higher than the concentration of TrxB, respectively (35, 36). Our and others\u2019 results of the comparatively similar susceptibility of mutants lacking TrxB and other components of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase machinery towards auranofin when compared to the WT support this reasoning (11, 17, 37). Given the fact that cells of higher eukaryotes also contain high amounts of cysteine pair\u2013containing proteins (proteomic studies suggest a thioredoxin concentration 26.0 times higher than the concentration of thioredoxin reductase 1 in a commonly used human cell line (38)), thioredoxin reductase might not be the exclusive target in higher eukaryotes, either.\nUsing the engineered redox probe protein, roGFP2 allowed us to directly observe the interaction of auranofin with cysteine thiols in a protein. Exposing reduced roGFP2 to auranofin in\u00a0vitro led to a spectral change similar to the change induced by the well-established thiol oxidant AT-2 (Aldrithiol-2, 2,2\u2032-Dithiopyridin). Like the disulfide bond generated by AT-2, the auranofin-induced modification was stable over time and reversible by thiol reductants such as DTT, and prior blocking of thiol residues with iodoacetamide prevents the alteration of roGFP2\u2019s excitation spectrum. However, unlike a disulfide bond, the change in the spectrum can be reversed by the addition of iodoacetamide.\nThis indicated to us a direct interaction between gold(I) and the cysteines in roGFP2. ICP-OES revealed that gold is bound in an approximately 1:1\u00a0molar ratio (protein to gold) to auranofin-treated roGFP2, and prior treatment with iodoacetamide prevents this gold binding. Similarly, iodoacetamide treatment after auranofin treatment significantly diminishes the amount of gold bound to roGFP2. All our data point to a direct interaction between the cysteine pair in roGFP2 and the gold ion in auranofin. Performing the same experiment with TrxA revealed the same pattern: an approximately 1:1\u00a0molar ratio of protein to gold, inhibition of gold binding by prior blocking of TrxA\u2019s cysteines with iodoacetamide, and release of gold by iodoacetamide treatment of gold-containing TrxA. We thus concluded that these proteins can potentially form S-Au-S bonds or other S-Au adducts, which functionally mimic disulfide bonds, as evidenced by the spectral change in roGFP2 and the inhibition of TrxA\u2019s reductase activity. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that our effects are caused by the formation of a sulfur gold complex that only includes one of the cysteines in the cysteine pairs found in both proteins. However, the fact that the molar ratio of protein to gold was actually slightly below 1:1 even in the presence of a 10 fold excess of auranofin suggests that if such a 1 cysteine and 1 gold complex exists, it would sterically block the second cysteine from interacting.\nThe observed reactivity of these protein S-Au adducts with iodoacetamide has implications on the interpretation of data obtained with methodologies typically used to determine the modification state of protein cysteines: as an example, recent studies have looked at the effect of auranofin on protein cysteines in\u00a0vivo in redox proteomic experiments (39, 40, 41). These studies employed alkylating agents, such as iodoacetamide, iodoacetamide-based probes, or N-ethylmaleimide to block \u201cunmodified\u201d cysteines. However, considering our findings, S-Au adducts that could have formed would have probably reacted during the blocking step with these alkylating agents and thus would appear as unmodified cysteines in proteomic screenings. If one assumes, that S-Au adduct formation in a protein has functional consequences (as evidenced by the inactivation of thioredoxin that we observed), redox proteomic studies using alkylating agents to determine cysteine modifications might underestimate the effect of auranofin on the functionality of cysteine-containing proteins.\nOthers have also studied the formation of sulfur gold adducts in proteins. A study by Yan et\u00a0al. (42) identified a single cysteine, C1039, in the primary E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 that can be modified by auranofin. Once modified, it enhances this protein's interaction with the majority of ubiquitin-conjugating E2s. Their study is based on mutagenesis and interaction studies. Interestingly, the removal of the neighboring cysteine, C1040, does not diminish the enhanced interaction elicited by auranofin, suggesting that in the case of this protein, there is an interaction between one cysteine and the gold ion, which is still connected to its triethylphosphine ligand. Proteins with only one free cysteine, such as serum albumin or human hemoglobin, also form adducts with gold connected to its triethylphosphine ligand (43, 44).\nThe spectral change of roGFP2 exposed to auranofin observed here in\u00a0vitro was also observed in\u00a0vivo in bacterial cells expressing roGFP2 exposed to auranofin (17). The rate of spectral change in Gram-positive bacteria, which lack the low-molecular-weight thiol glutathione, was similar to the rate observed here in\u00a0vitro, indicating that S-Au adducts also form in living cells, at a rate similar to the rate found in our in\u00a0vitro findings.\nGold bound to a cysteine pair can be relocated from one reduced cysteine pair to another within the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase thioredoxin glutathione reductase (8, 45). We suspect that such a transfer, but between proteins, is the reason why inhibition of TrxB by auranofin is abrogated in the presence of high concentrations of TrxA, a mechanism suggested by Saccoccia et\u00a0al. (8). In line, we show that thioredoxin is indeed able to re-activate inhibited TrxB to some extent and also to remove the spectrum-changing gold-adduct from roGFP2. These data suggest a potential protective role of the thioredoxin system against auranofin-induced stress. However, it remains unclear if the thioredoxin gold adduct is a dead end or if other systems in the cell can restore thioredoxin to its free thiol form. Short of reduction of Au(I) to its elemental form, only transfer to another thiol couple comes to mind as a thioredoxin-restoring mechanism. Here, low molecular weight thiols, such as glutathione, could play a major role. Indeed, we found that the presence of high concentrations of glutathione is one of the factors contributing most strongly to the low susceptibility of the Gram-negative bacterium E.\u00a0coli to auranofin when compared to the Gram-positive bacterium B.\u00a0subtilis (17).\nOverall, our data suggest that thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) is not the exclusive target of auranofin in bacteria. Instead, thiol pairs are directly attacked at rates that imply S-Au adduct formation as an integral part of auranofin\u2019s antibacterial mode of action. Such a revised model of auranofin\u2019s mode of action is consistent with a large extent of the data stated in the literature concerning auranofin\u2019s effects in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, also in higher eukaryotes. Our findings imply that in higher eukaryotes, too, thioredoxin reductase might not be the only target of auranofin. Moreover, it resolves the paradoxical nature of some of the observations of auranofin\u2019s nature as inhibitor, namely the many reports of IC50 or Ki values for an inhibitor that is presumably irreversible in nature: the transfer of gold(I) adducts from thioredoxin reductase to its substrates could be misinterpreted as reversible binding of the inhibitor. As long as the auranofin concentration in an assay is too low for all thiol pairs present to form S-Au adducts, residual thioredoxin reductase activity could potentially be observed, despite the irreversible nature of the actual inhibition reaction.\n\n## Construction of plasmids encoding components of the bacterial Trx system\nBacterial strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table\u00a01.

The overnight culture was then used to inoculate 5\u00a0L of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin. Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 120\u00a0rpm until an A600 of 0.5 to 0.6 was reached. Subsequently, protein expression was induced by adding 1\u00a0mM IPTG to the cell culture. After overnight incubation at 20 \u00b0C and 120\u00a0rpm, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7800g and 4 \u00b0C for 45\u00a0min, and pellets were stored at\u00a0\u221280 \u00b0C.\nHeterologous roGFP2 expression and purification, as well as E.\u00a0coli and B.\u00a0subtilis TrxB expression and purification, followed established protocols (17, 26).\n\n## Purification of thioredoxins\nThe cell pellet obtained after TrxA overexpression in E.\u00a0coli MV007 (ecTrxA) was washed once with 80\u00a0ml of lysis buffer 1 (20\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0) containing 2\u00a0ml of EDTA-free protease inh",
