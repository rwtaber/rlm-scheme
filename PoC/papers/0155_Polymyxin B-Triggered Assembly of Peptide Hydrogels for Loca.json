Herein, a peptide hydrogel is reported for the localized and sustained release of polymyxin B (PMB), a decade-old antibiotic with increasing clinical utility for treating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. The hydrogel is assembled by additing PMB solution into a rationally designed peptide amphiphile (PA) solution and its mechanical properties can be adjusted through the addition of counterions, envisioning its application in diverse infection scenarios. Sustained release of PMB from the hydrogel over a 5-day period and prolonged antimicrobial activities against Gram-negative bacteria are observed. The localized release of active PMB from the hydrogel is shown to be effective in vivo for treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the Galleria mellonella burn wound infection model, dramatically reducing the mortality from 93% to 13%. Complementary antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and enhanced antimicrobial effect against the Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii are observed when an additional antibiotic fusidic acid is incorporated into the hydrogen network. These results demonstrate the potential of the PMB-triggered PA hydrogel as a versatile platform for the localized and sustained delivery of combined antimicrobial therapies.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntibiotics remain the main agent to treat bacterial infections, even though their efficacy is now compromised due to overuse in humans, animals, and agriculture, with bacteria developing resistance that renders them ineffective.[\n\n1\n\n] The increasing number of antibiotic\u2010resistant bacteria has emerged as a significant global concern and tackling the problem will require the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents and advanced therapies.[\n\n2\n\n] However, with very few antibiotics in the pipeline and given the difficulties in bringing new antibiotics to the market,[\n\n3\n\n] revitalizing the existing antibiotics and repurposing them into more effective and safer formulations may provide an alternative life\u2010saving therapy for immediate clinical applications.[\n\n4\n\n]\nPolymyxins are a family of antibiotics, consisting of polymyxin B (PMB) and polymyxin E (also known as colistin), discovered more than 50 years ago.[\n\n5\n\n] They are cyclic pentacationic lipopeptides that exert their antimicrobial activities by specifically binding to the anionic lipopolysaccharide within the outer membrane of Gram\u2010negative bacteria first, followed by penetrating into the outer membrane and leading to the bacterial cell death.[\n\n6\n\n] Even though the clinical use of polymyxins was largely abandoned in the 1970s, because of their potential nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, they are increasingly used now by clinicians as the last resort to treat infections caused by multidrug\u2010resistant (MDR) Gram\u2010negative bacteria.[\n\n7\n\n] However, due to the low oral bioavailability of PMB, only topical (ointment) and intravenous formulations are currently available in the market, which are typically associated with unpredictable pharmacokinetics.[\n\n8\n\n] In addition, dosage restrictions due nephrotoxicity issues make polymyxins less efficacious in vivo.[\n\n9\n\n] To reduce toxicity and enhance the antimicrobial performance of PMB, various efforts have been made in two main directions. One direction has been focused on the synthesis of new PMB derivatives based on medicinal chemistry principles,[\n\n6\n, \n10\n\n] while the other has been centered around the development of new PMB formulations through nanomedicine\u2010based approaches,[\n\n11\n\n] such as nanoparticles,[\n\n12\n\n] liposomes,[\n\n13\n\n] and hydrogels,[\n\n14\n\n] for the controlled release of PMB directly at the infection sites.\nHydrogels have gained extensive interest for the controlled delivery of therapeutics.[\n\n15\n\n] Owing to their tunable mechanical properties, hydrogels can be either injected or implanted at the desired sites, acting as reservoirs for the localized and sustained release of drugs. Their high degree of water content makes them particularly attractive as wound care materials. Compared to other materials, hydrogels can prevent the loss of body fluids and keep the wound surface hydrated, support the release of therapeutics and promote the healing process, as well as act as barriers against bacterial infections.[\n\n16\n\n] The use of peptides as building blocks for hydrogel fabrication has been increasingly appealing due to their inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability.[\n\n17\n\n] In addition, through rational design of the peptide sequences, biological and environmentally responsive functionalities can be incorporated into the hydrogels, enabling their diverse biomedical applications.[\n\n18\n\n] Several peptide\u2010based hydrogels, such as \u03b2\u2010hairpin and multidomain peptide hydrogels, initially exploited for applications in regenerative medicine, have now been modified and assessed for their antimicrobial activities.[\n\n19\n\n]\nSince peptides possess chemical groups sensitive to thermal, enzymatic, and chemical conditions, their gelation via physical cross\u2010linking has been more frequently utilized rather than covalent cross\u2010linking which typically requires additional chemical modifications. For example, multivalent ions, such as PO4\n3\u2212 and Ca2+, have been shown to shield the opposite charges of peptides and trigger their self\u2010assembly into hydrogel networks.[\n\n20\n\n] Similarly, anionic drugs such as heparin and suramin have also been used to promote the physical cross\u2010linking of cationic multidomain peptide nanofibers into self\u2010supporting hydrogels.[\n\n21\n\n] In this context, the cationic PMB was investigated here as a potential ionic cross\u2010linker and trigger of the supramolecular gelation of peptides with opposite charge. Self\u2010assembling peptide amphiphiles (PAs) containing negatively charged carboxyl groups were designed and their PMB\u2010triggered gelation was examined from the molecular to the macroscopic level. The capacity of the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogel as an effective formulation for sustained PMB delivery was assessed by determining the release profile of PMB from the hydrogel. Their antibacterial performance was evaluated both in vitro by disk transfer and diffusion method and in vivo on a Galleria mellonella burn wound infection model. Moreover, proof\u2010of\u2010concept experiments were performed to examine the capacity of the hydrogel to incorporate additional antibiotics for combined antimicrobial therapy. The PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogel, obtained by molecular self\u2010assembly in mild environmental conditions, provides a simple and versatile formulation for the localized and sustained delivery of PMB.\n\n## Molecular Design and Assembly\nAs displayed in Figure\u00a0\n1a\n, the PMB molecule contains five primary amines in its structure, which can establish electrostatic interactions with molecules or assemblies of opposite charges and eventually induce gelation. To investigate the possibility and mechanism of the PMB\u2010triggered gelation of peptide assemblies, three variations of PAs were designed. All the three PAs contain glutamic acid residues in their sequences, displaying ionizable carboxylic acid groups on their side chains. Among them, the threonine (T)\u2010containng PA (TPA) has a tripeptide headgroup, glutamic acid\u2013threonine\u2013glutamic acid (Figure\u00a01b), which was designed to form paired interactions with the tripeptide sequence, diaminobutyric acid\u2013threonine\u2013diaminobutyric acid, in the linear tail of PMB. To elucidate the role of hydrogen bonding between the threonine residues, a glutamic acid (E)containing PA (EPA) was designed by substituting the middle threonine in TPA by glutamic acid (Figure\u00a01c). Moreover, a beta\u2010sheet forming PA (BPA, Figure\u00a01d), known to assemble into nanofiber structures and containing a segment of six amino acids (VVVAAA) between the hydrophobic alkyl tail and the hydrophilic peptide headgroup of EPA, was used here to reveal the influence of PA secondary structure on its eventual gelation triggered by PMB. All the three PAs were successfully synthesized and purified, with their mass and purity being confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI\u2010MS) and reverse\u2010phase high\u2010performance liquid chromatography, respectively (Figures S1\u2013S3, Supporting Information).\nUsing Nile red, a solvatochromic fluorescent dye that emits increased fluorescence intensity with pronounced blueshift when encapsulated into the hydrophobic region of PA assemblies,[\n\n22\n\n] the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) was determined to be 0.02 and 0.002\u00a0mg mL\u22121 for TPA and BPA, respectively (Figure S5, Supporting Information). However, no detectable CAC was obtained for EPA in a concentration range up to 10\u00a0mg\u00a0mL\u22121. When dissolved in water at 0.2\u00a0mg mL\u22121 (above their CAC), TPA assembled into bundled lamellar nanofibers with diameters of \u2248180\u00a0nm (Figure\u00a01e), while BPA formed cylindrical nanofibers with diameters around 10\u00a0nm as previously reported (Figure\u00a01f).[\n\n23\n\n] To further reveal the internal structure of the assembled nanofibers, circular dichroism (CD) characterization was performed. As displayed in the CD spectra (Figure\u00a01g), a maximum at 207\u00a0nm and a minimum at 227\u00a0nm were observed for the TPA nanofibers, which differ from the canonical \u03b2\u2010sheet conformation observed for the BPA nanofibers, exhibiting a maximum at 195\u00a0nm and minimum at 216\u00a0nm.[\n\n24\n\n] The redshifted \u03b2\u2010sheet signal was previously reported to be associated with increased twisting or disorder in the \u03b2\u2010sheet hydrogen bonding.[\n\n25\n\n] Consistent with this finding, slightly twisted TPA nanofibers could be observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Figure\u00a01e inset), which was also considered to constrain the unlimited lateral growth of these lamellar nanofiber.[\n\n26\n\n] By contrast, EPA displayed a random coil conformation (Figure\u00a01g) and no well\u2010defined nanostructures could be found under TEM, probably due to the strong repulsive forces among the negatively charged headgroups, preventing its assembly into stable structures. Thereby, only the lamellar TPA nanofibers and cylindrical BPA nanofibers were further investigated here for their ability to form hydrogels in the presence of PMB.\n\n## PMB\u2010Triggered Gelation\nWith the addition of 2\u00a0mg mL\u22121 PMB solution into an equal volume of 20\u00a0mg mL\u22121 TPA solution, a translucent and stable hydrogel was formed (Figure\u00a0\n2a1\n,a2). However, when the PMB and BPA solutions were similarly combined, only an opaque thin membrane was observed (Figure\u00a02b1), which was not stable and disappeared after overnight incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C (Figure\u00a02b2). Given that the main difference between the two negatively charged PA nanofibers is their molecular organization, the PMB\u2010triggered gelation of TPA could be attributable to the comparatively loose molecular packing inside the lamellar TPA nanofibers. As depicted in Figure\u00a02c, the less cohesive molecular organization of TPA in the lamellar nanofibers is expected to allow PMB to intercalate into the assemblies. Accordingly, the hydrophobic tails and hydroxyl side groups of threonine in both the TPA and PMB molecules could be brought into close contact, favoring the formation of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. As a consequence, the increased hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic forces between the TPA and PMB molecules could stabilize the weakly formed ionic linkage between the carboxyl groups of TPA and the amino groups of PMB, enhancing the internal cohesion of the assemblies. In this configuration, the amino groups in the PMB ring could further form electrostatic interactions with other TPA nanofibers, promoting the cross\u2010linking of TPA nanofibers and leading to the formation of stable hydrogels (Figure\u00a02c). By contrast, the \u03b2\u2010sheet forming domain of BPA is known to promote strong hydrogen bonding among the BPA molecules,[\n\n27\n\n] enabling their radial organization and growth into cylindrical nanofibers with more tightly packed BPA molecules, which may prevent the insertion of the lipid tail of PMB into the hydrophobic core of BPA nanofibers (Figure\u00a02d). As a result, the interactions between BPA and PMB could merely occur at the surface of the BPA nanofibers via electrostatic interactions. The lack of additional interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between the BPA nanofibers and PMB molecules, results in the formation of unstable membranes.\nApart from the different molecular packing within the nanofibers, another noted difference between TPA and BPA is the viscosity of their own aqueous solutions before the addition of PMB solution. The difference in viscosity is expected to affect the mixing kinetics when PMB is added and consequently leading to different modes of interaction. Compared to the BPA solution with the same concentration, TPA solution was more viscous, with reduced fluidity as seen in the inverted\u2010vial test (Figure\u00a02a4). Therefore, various negatively charged polymers known to generate high viscous solutions were selected to investigate whether the PMB\u2010triggered gelation was viscosity\u2010dependent. These polymers include alginate, hyaluronic acid, and polyacrylic acid. Upon interaction with PMB, opaque interfaces were observed for alginate and polyacrylic acid but disappeared after overnight incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, while no evident changes were observed for hyaluronic acid (Table S1, Supporting Information). Overall, none of these highly viscous solutions of anionic polymers were able to form stable hydrogels with the addition of PMB.\nCollectively, the presence of negative charge and high viscosity were not sufficient for the PMB\u2010triggered gelation. The rationally designed TPA, which assembled into lamellar nanofibers with relatively loose molecular packing, is likely to be determinant for permitting intercalation of PMB within the lamellar nanofibers, enhancing their internal cohesion and promoting their cross\u2010linking into stable hydrogels.\n\n## Nanofibrous Hydrogel Network\nThe PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogel was observed to have an opaque thin top layer and a more transparent thick bottom layer (Figure\u00a02a2). To elucidate the difference in the two layers, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine their nanoscale structure (Figure\u00a0\n3a1\n). As shown in Figure\u00a03b1,b2, well\u2010packed thick fibrous nanostructures were observed for the surface of the top layer. By contrast, more porous and thinner nanofibers were visualized for the bottom layer (Figure\u00a03c1,c2). Coexistence of both thick and thin nanofibers could be found at the interface between the top and bottom layer of the hydrogel (Figure\u00a03d1,d2). To further reveal the composition of the two distinct layers, the hydrogel was sectioned by cryostat microtome and stained with toluidine blue, a basic dye used in histology for staining acidic macromolecules in tissues.[\n\n28\n\n] Compared to the top layer, the bottom layer of the hydrogel exhibited a more intense blue color (Figure\u00a03a2), indicating less PMB in the bottom layer than in the top layer of the hydrogel.\nTaken together, the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogel was demonstrated to have two distinct layers with respect to the nanofiber network. The top layer is a dense contact layer of PMB molecules and TPA lamellar nanofibers formed by charge complexation, acting as a diffusion barrier. As a result, more PMB molecules accumulate in the top layer, so that the toluidine blue could barely stain the top layer. By contrast, the bottom layer exhibits intense blue color with the toluidine blue staining, containing less diffused PMB molecules and displaying a relatively less cross\u2010linked nanofiber network.\n\n## Optimized Hydrogel Composition\nTo determine the optimum proportion of PMB and TPA used for the hydrogel preparation, a fixed concentration of PMB solution at 2\u00a0mg mL\u22121 was used to trigger the gelation of TPA solution with varying concentrations. Quantified by the fluorescamine assay,[\n\n29\n\n] the encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of PMB in the hydrogels was found to increase when the concentration of TPA solution increased from 4 to 16\u00a0mg mL\u22121 (Figure\u00a0\n4a\n). A maximum encapsulation efficiency of PMB was achieved at 89.78% in the hydrogel prepared with 16\u00a0mg mL\u22121 TPA solution. However, further increase in the TPA concentration resulted in a slightly decreased EE% of PMB in the hydrogels (Figure\u00a04a).\nGiven that these hydrogels contain only two components, PMB and TPA, their mechanical properties should also be affected by changing the proportion of PMB and TPA incorporated. As such, oscillatory rheological measurements were performed on these PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels. Amplitude sweeps demonstrated that these hydrogels could maintain their linear viscoelastic region with up to 1% oscillation strain at frequency of 1\u00a0Hz (Figure S7, Supporting Information). Therefore, frequency sweeps were performed at 0.1% strain with change in frequency. As shown in Figure\u00a04b, the change in the mechanical stiffness of these hydrogels followed the same trend as the change in the PMB EE%. A steady increase in both storage (G\u2032) and loss (G\u02ba) moduli was observed with increasing TPA concentration up to 16\u00a0mg mL\u22121, after which a decrease in both the G\u2032 and G\u02ba was observed with further increase in TPA concentration.\nThese results are notable as the developed formulation enables high EE% and enhanced mechanical properties. Overall, equal volumes of 2\u00a0mg mL\u22121 PMB solution and 16\u00a0mg mL\u22121 TPA solution provided the optimized composition in the hydrogel, with the maximum EE% of PMB and the highest mechanical stiffness.\n\n## Tunable Mechanical Properties\nAntibacterial hydrogels intended for local delivery require adaptable mechanical properties to facilitate their application at different tissue sites. For example, when treating fracture or implant\u2010related bone infections, a higher stiffness is typically desired to provide mechanical stability.[\n\n30\n\n] Therefore, the possibility to regulate the mechanical properties of the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels was exploited here to expand their potential applications. Even though tunable stiffness of the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogel could be obtained by adjusting the concentration of TPA, the variation range is narrow with the highest G\u2032 obtained under 10\u00a0kPa (Figure\u00a04b). To further increase their stiffness, calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution was used to dissolve PMB for the hydrogel preparation, instead of pure water, because calcium ions were previously used for shielding the negative charges of self\u2010assembling peptides, promoting intra\u2010 and intermolecular cross\u2010linking and allowing the formation of nanofibers and self\u2010supporting hydrogels.[\n\n20b\n\n] As expected, a 5\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22123\nm CaCl2 solution, with equivalent number of positive charges as in the 2\u00a0mg mL\u22121 PMB solution, could also trigger TPA gelation with the hydrogel exhibiting a slightly higher G\u2032 (6526\u00a0\u00b1 697\u00a0Pa) but lower G\u02ba (1219\u00a0\u00b1 149\u00a0Pa) than the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogel with G\u2032 at 5429\u00a0\u00b1 432\u00a0Pa and G\u02ba at 2011\u00a0\u00b1 124\u00a0Pa (Figure\u00a04c). In addition, increasing the calcium ionic strength of PMB solution from 0 to 5\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22123\nm resulted in an approximately tenfold increase in the mechanical stiffness of the formed hydrogels (Figure\u00a04c). Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed for the EE% of PMB in the formed hydrogels with increasing concentration of calcium ions (Figure\u00a04d). These results suggest that the addition of calcium ions can promote further cross\u2010linking of the hydrogel network without interfering with the interactions between PMB and TPA nanofibers. The tunable mechanical properties of these hydrogels, adjusted by the amount of calcium ions added into the PMB solution for hydrogel preparation, reveal their potential as implantable antimicrobial biomaterials.\nTo gain further insight into the effect of the hydrogels\u2019 mechanical properties and PMB EE% on their antibiotic release and antibacterial activities, three representative hydrogels with varying stiffnesses and EE% of PMB were selected to perform the experiments described in the following sections. Among which, the PMB Gel is referred to the hydrogel triggered by 2\u00a0mg mL\u22121 PMB solution; the PMB+Ca Gel referred to hydrogel triggered by 2\u00a0mg mL\u22121 PMB in 5\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22123\nm CaCl2 solution; and the Ca Gel referred to hydrogel triggered by 5\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22123\nm CaCl2 solution.\n\n## Sustained Polymyxin B Release\nThe antibiotic release behavior of the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels was investigated in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS), which was placed over the top of the hydrogels. As demonstrated in Figure\u00a0\n5a\n, the PMB\u2010containing hydrogels (PMB Gel and PMB+Ca Gel) displayed sustained PMB release, with up to 96.6\u00a0\u00b1 2.3% release achieved for the PMB Gel over a 5\u2010day period, while relatively less release was observed for the PMB+Ca Gel (78.7\u00a0\u00b1 7.3%). The release profile of PMB was then modeled and Equation\u00a0(1) (R\n2 = 0.97) and Equation\u00a0(2) (R\n2 = 0.99) were obtained for the PMB Gel and PMB+Ca Gel, respectively, in which t is the release time, Mt is the cumulative amount of PMB released at time t, and M\u221e is the total PMB amount used to prepare the hydrogels\n(1)MtM\u221e\u00d7100%=19.67\u00d7t0.34\n(2)MtM\u221e\u00d7100%=12.59\u00d7t0.45\nThe two equations conform to the Peppas equation, Mt/M\u221e\u2005 = \u2005ktn\n, in which k is the constant on the structure and geometric properties of the drug loading matrix, and n is the release index, with n = 0.5 suggesting the diffusion\u2010dependent release kinetics, n = 1 indicating the erosion\u2010dependent release kinetics, and 0.5 < n <\u00a01 signifying diffusion and erosion codependent release kinetics.[\n\n31\n\n] In Equations\u00a0(1) and (2), n \u2248 0.5, suggesting that the PMB release kinetics is diffusion\u2010dependent. These values of n are not exactly 0.5 because the two extrema, 0.5 and 1, only apply to the slab matrix. For matrixes with different geometries, such as spherical and cylindrical, values of the two extrema are different.[\n\n31\n, \n32\n\n] First derivative of the release profiles showed that the release rates for both PMB\u2010containing PA hydrogels were initially faster, but then tapered after 8 h to a nearly constant release rate lower than 10\u00a0\u00b5g h\u22121 (Figure\u00a05b). However, compared to the PMB Gel, the final release amount and release rate of PMB from the PMB+Ca Gel were relatively lower (Figure\u00a05a,b). These may be caused by the decelerated diffusion process of PMB from the PMB+Ca Gel, as enhanced mechanical properties were observed for the PMB+Ca Gel than the PMB Gel, which suggested a more tightly packed network formed in the PMB+Ca Gel with the addition of calcium ions. Overall, sustained PMB release from the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels via a diffusion\u2010dependent kinetic was observed. The final release amount and release rate of PMB from the hydrogels could be altered with the addition of calcium ions, making the dosage optimization possible to meet different clinical demands.\n\n## Prolonged Antimicrobial Activity\nCompared to the soluble formulation of PMB, the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels were hypothesized to possess prolonged antimicrobial activity since sustained PMB release over a 5\u2010day period was demonstrated. Since the PMB is a proven bactericide with rapid membrane disruption ability,[\n\n33\n\n] the prolonged in vitro antimicrobial activity of the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels was examined by a previously reported disk transfer and diffusion method,[\n\n34\n\n] rather than the colony count assay typically used to assess the capacity for inhibition of bacterial growth.[\n\n19c\n\n] As illustrated in Figure\u00a05c, disks loaded with either PMB solution or hydrogel (containing the same amount of PMB as in the solution) were transferred every 1.5 h onto the next bacterial\u2010suspension\u2010swabbed agar plate. After overnight culturing, clear bacteria\u2010free zones, also known as inhibition zones, could be observed from the disk loading different PMB formulations.\nGram\u2010negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 was chosen to perform the experiment and its susceptibility to PMB diffused from the disk was first verified by the dose response assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PMB against PA14, determined by broth microtiter dilution, is 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121.[\n\n35\n\n] However, no inhibitory effect was observed from the disk loading 2\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0mL\u22121 PMB solution (Figure\u00a05d), which is probably due to the limited amount of PMB diffused into the agar plate over 1.5\u00a0h. Inhibition zones started to appear around disk loading 20\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 PMB solution. Above this concentration, the diameter of the formed inhibition zone was shown to be positively correlated with the logarithm of PMB concentration (Figure\u00a05d). The greater the PMB concentration loaded into the disk, the higher the amount of PMB could diffuse into the agar over 1.5 h, and therefore the larger the inhibitory zone against P. aeruginosa PA14.\nIn the disk transfer and diffusion experiment, a gradual decline in the inhibitory effect against P. aeruginosa PA14 was observed for disks loaded with solutions containing PMB in the free form, with only limited and unchanged antibacterial effect being observed after 12 h (Figure\u00a05e and Figure S9, Supporting Information). By contrast, increasing inhibitory effect was observed for disks loaded with the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels in the first 4.5 h, and since then a significant level of inhibitory effect was maintained up to 24 h (Figure\u00a05e). These results suggested that the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels could provide sustained PMB release and subsequently prolong the antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa PA14. The concentration of PMB released at each time point was always above its MIC (0.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121),[\n\n35\n\n] therefore minimizing the risk for inducing microbial resistance.[\n\n36\n\n] The addition of calcium ions to the soluble PMB formulation did not significantly affect its antimicrobial profile. Despite slightly weakened antimicrobial activities were observed when the calcium ions were added into the hydrogel (Figure\u00a05e), probably due to the reduced PMB release from the hydrogel containing calcium ions, the observed difference is not statistically significant. In addition, the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels were also proven to have extended antimicrobial effects against the Gram\u2010negative Escherichia coli (Figure S10, Supporting Information) and Acinetobacter baumannii (Figure S11, Supporting Information). The sustained PMB release and prolonged antimicrobial activities of the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels indicated their potential to act as localized reservoirs for the delivery of PMB and treatment of persistent infections caused by Gram\u2010negative bacteria.\n\n## Effective In Vivo Antimicrobial Potency\nTo validate the in vivo antimicrobial efficiency of the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels, experiments were performed on an invertebrate G. mellonella model, as an alternative to mammalian models, such as mice and rabbits. Compared to the mammalian models, the G. mellonella model is more cost\u2010effective and less challenging in ethics, requires shorter experimental cycle, while providing larger volume of data for higher power statistical analysis.[\n\n37\n\n] It has become an increasingly popular nonmammalian model for studying bacterial infections and screening antimicrobial drugs.[\n\n38\n\n] Previously, a self\u2010assembling peptide hydrogel (NapFFKK\u2014OH) was examined on the G. mellonella infection model through injection for investigating its in vivo toxicity and antimicrobial activity.[\n\n39\n\n] To facilitate additional administration routes, a G. mellonella burn wound infection model was established recently by us and collaborators (Figure\u00a0\n6a\n,b), which could closely match etiological manifestation of burn wound infections in humans and other mammalian models.[\n\n40\n\n] After having confirmed the safety profile of TPA and PMB in Galleria, through direct injection of solutions at concentrations used for the hydrogel preparation (20\u00a0mg mL\u22121 and 2\u00a0mg mL\u22121, respectively, Figure S12, Supporting Information), the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels were applied directly onto the infected burn wound of Galleria (Figure S13C, Supporting Information) for evaluating their in vivo antimicrobial efficacy.\nAs shown in Figure\u00a06c, the burn protocol for wound creation was well\u2010tolerated by Galleria, as more than 95% of the larvae in the control (Burn Only) group were alive after 5 days at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Longer\u2010time observation was avoided because the larvae began to cocoon after 5 days. A highly pathogenic P. aeruginosa strain PA14, originally isolated from a human burn wound patient, was chosen for infecting the wounded Galleria.[\n\n41\n\n] The infection led to a high level of mortality, with only 7% survival observed after 5 days for the PA14 Infection group. After applying the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels, significant reduction in mortality was observed in both the PMB Gel and PMB+Ca Gel treated groups. More interestingly, the PMB+Ca Gel was observed to be slightly more effective than the PMB Gel, in terms of promoting the survival rate of the larvae, despite exhibiting comparatively lower cumulative PMB release amount. Approximately 87% of the larvae were observed to survive after 5 days when treated with the PMB+Ca Gel, while only around 70% survival was observed in the PMB Gel treated group. The increased survival with the PMB+Ca Gel treatment may be due to its enhanced mechanical properties compared to the PMB Gel, which enables the hydrogel to remain in place and promotes better sealing of the wound. Surprisingly, the Ca Gel treatment group, which served as the negative control group, also promoted 20% survival after 5 days. The slightly improved survival of Galleria is probably due to the beneficial effect from the enhanced wound hydration provided by the Ca Gel treatment, as severe fluid loss has been reported to be partly responsible for mortality in the established G. mellonella burn wound infection model.[\n\n40\n\n] Altogether, the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogels were demonstrated to be effective in vivo for treating Gram\u2010negative P. aeruginosa PA14 infection on a G. mellonella burn wound infection model, by significantly reducing the mortality from 93% to 13%.\n\n## Combined Antimicrobial Therapy\nTaking advantage of the nanofibrous and porous architecture of the PMB\u2010triggered PA hydrogel, the incorporation of additional antibiotics into the hydrogel network was considered for the development of combined antimicrobial therapy. Given that PMB is only effective in killing Gram\u2010negative bacteria, fusidic acid (FA), an antibiotic that is effective in killing Gram\u2010positive bacteria,[\n\n42\n\n] was chosen as a model for evaluating the possible therapeutic combination. To prepare hydrogels containing the two antibiotics, FA solution (2\u00a0mg mL\u22121) was first prepared and used to dissolve the TPA at concentration of 16\u00a0mg mL\u22121. Upon addition of the 2\u00a0mg mL\u22121 PMB solution, FA+PMB Gel was formed, indicating that the PMB\u2010triggered hydrogel assembly was not affected by the incorporation of FA. As shown in Figure\u00a0\n7a\n, the incorporated FA could be effectively released from the FA+PMB Gel and remained active against Gram\u2010positive Staphylococcus aureus. By contrast, no such activity was observed for the PMB Gel. In addition, compared to the FA and FA+PMB solutions, the FA+PMB Gel also exhibited sustained antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, with increasing inhibition zones being observed over time (Figure\u00a07a). However, FA+PMB solution only displayed higher antimicrobial potency tha",
