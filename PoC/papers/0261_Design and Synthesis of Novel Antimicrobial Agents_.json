The period of antibiotics, which saw the discovery and development of numerous antibacterial drugs, began with Fleming\u2019s discovery of penicillin in 1929. Regrettably, the emergence of resistant strains was brought on by the overuse and careless use of antibiotics [2,3]. According to 2019 systemic analytic research, there were 4.95 million fatalities attributable to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). With 27.3 deaths per 100,000 people, western sub-Saharan Africa has the highest mortality rate, whereas Australasia has the lowest mortality rate with 6.5 deaths per 100,000 people [4]. Twelve families of bacteria have been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the most dangerous to human health and have been divided into three priority groups: critical pathogens (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacteriaceae), high priority pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, Salmonella spp., Nisseria gonorrhoeae), and medium priority pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella spp.) [5,6,7,8]. The presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) ESKAPE pathogens (including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria has rendered even the most effective drugs ineffective. Therefore, its necessary to develop novel strategies and approaches to overcome the problem of increasing AMR [9,10,11]. This review outlines various strategies employed in the design and development of new antimicrobial agents. These include the utilization of nanotechnology and computational methods (such as in silico and fragment-based drug design (FBDD)) which have led to improved antimicrobial efficacy and enhanced selectivity towards target sites. In addition, antibiotic alternatives (antimicrobial peptides, essential oils, anti-Quorum sensing, darobactins, vitamin B6, bacteriophages, odilorhabdins, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, cannabinoids), drug repurposing (ticagrelor, mitomycin C, auranofin, pentamidine, and zidovudine) and synthesis of novel antibacterial agents (lactones, piperidinol, sugar-based bactericide, isoxazole, carbazole, pyrimidines, and pyrazoles derivatives) are novel approaches to treat infectious diseases. Furthermore, prodrugs (e.g., siderophores) and combinatorial treatments have recently been shown to be an excellent platform to design a new generation of antimicrobial agents with better efficacy against multidrug-resistant bacteria.\n\n## 2. Antibiotic Classification\nNew antibiotic use methods should be implemented on a local and global level to combat resistance, and the development of novel treatments requires a thorough understanding of how antibiotics function. Table 1 summarizes how antibiotics produce their effects through a variety of mechanism of action. Antibiotic-mediated cell death is a complicated process that begins with a physical interaction between the medication and its particular target in bacteria, altering the bacterium\u2019s biochemical, molecular, or ultrastructural levels. The development of DNA double-stranded DNA breaks, the halting of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis, cell envelop damage, protein mistranslation, and stress induction are only a few of the methods through which antibiotics can cause cell death [12]. Antimicrobial agents are divided into two categories on the basis of how they affect bacteria in a test tube: (1) bactericidal (kill bacteria) antibiotics such as \u03b2-lactams, glycopeptides, lipopeptides, rifamycins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, and (2) bacteriostatic (prevent bacterial growth) antibiotics such as sulfonamides\u2013trimethoprim and macrolides. Bacteriostatic substances can also be described as having a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio higher than four, and bactericidal substances when the MBC to MIC ratio is lower than or equal to four [13].\n\n## 3. Antimicrobial Resistance\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes antimicrobial resistance as a natural phenomenon that happens when germs cease responding to antibiotics that they were previously susceptible to before. Resistance makes treating infections more difficult or impossible [8,32]. In bacteria, there are two types of resistance: acquired and natural [33]. Natural resistance can either be produced or intrinsic (expressed in a species without connection to horizontal gene transfer) (the natural bacterial genes are only expressed to resistance levels after exposure to an antibiotic). Contrarily, acquired resistance can develop after acquiring genetic material that already exhibits it through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (transformation, transposition, and conjugation) or by causing a mutation in the cell\u2019s DNA during replication [8,33,34]. Antimicrobial resistance mechanisms include drug inactivation, decreased intracellular drug concentration, and altered drug targets (Figure 7) [35,36]. One of the most significant mechanisms of acquired resistance is the change or degradation of antibiotics. Bacterial enzymes have the ability to alter a number of antibiotics, including aminoglycoside, chloramphenicol, and \u03b2-lactam [37,38]. By increasing efflux or decreasing influx, one can lower drug concentration [39]. Bacteria can develop a high level of inherent resistance owing to this method. Porin mutations in resistant strains alter the permeability of bacterial membranes, which reduces medication uptake into the cell. For instance, OprD, a particular porin in strains of P. aeruginosa, can result in a mutation for carbapenem resistance [40]. The Proteobacterial Antimicrobial Compound Efflux (PACE) superfamily, the Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) family, the Small Multidrug Resistance (SMR) superfamily, the Multidrug and Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) superfamily, and the ATP (adenosine triphosphate)-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily are the six families that make up the transmembrane proteins that make up efflux pumps [41,42]. The most prevalent efflux pumps in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are MFS and RND pumps [39]. The medication target changing is another method of resistance. Examples include the resistance to glycopeptide and polymyxin antibiotics caused by enzymes that chemically alter components of the cell membrane necessary for antibiotic binding. Methyltransferases are another example of target modifying enzymes since they change the rRNA elements on the ribosome and thus become resistant to antibiotics including aminoglycoside, lincosamide, macrolide, streptogramin, and oxazolidinone [43]. Another phenomenon known as \u201ctarget protection\u201d occurs when an antibiotic target\u2019s resistance protein protects it from antibiotic-induced inhibition (target protection protein). Tetracycline ribosomal protection proteins (TRPPs) are an illustration of this mechanism [44].\n\n## 4. Antibiotic Use and Resistance in Agriculture Sector\n\u03b2-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, and other antibiotics with comparable modes of action to those used by humans are causing a lot of concern due to their possible side effects and risk management strategies [45]. Because medicines are available over the counter, their overuse, abuse, and misuse are linked to antibiotic resistance [46]. Antibiotic resistance is caused by the use of antibiotics in animals raised for food. Food safety and public health may suffer if antibiotic residues are found in products obtained from animals that are intended for human consumption [47,48,49]. Use of unnecessary antibiotics in animals for the purpose of promoting development, as well as waste products from veterinary care and livestock farming, human waste streams, and soil fertilization, can result in the release of antibiotics pollution into the environment. As a result, it is possible to think of the environment as a reservoir for antibiotics and bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and their resistance genes [45,50,51,52]. Reports that some bacterial infections in humans are brought on by animal pathogens (zoonotic pathogens) such as Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterococcus spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli [53,54,55] have demonstrated that antibiotic resistance can be transmitted directly or indirectly from animal to human. To prevent antibiotic resistance and maintain the potency of the available antibiotics, a number of practices should be regulated for the prudent use of antibiotics in the clinical and agricultural sectors [56,57]. The demand for antibiotics to cure illnesses can be decreased by improving animal feed, waste management, and animals\u2019 natural immunity. Moreover, using antibiotic alternatives including prebiotics, probiotic vaccines, and bacteriophages can help reduce the need for antibiotics [58,59,60].\n\n## 5. Novel Therapeutic Agents\nHere, we discuss the most recent methods and tools (Figure 8) used to resurrect antimicrobial drugs as a result of rising antibiotic resistance.\n\n## 5.1. Nanotechnology in Combating Bacterial Resistance\nThe drug resistance dilemma can potentially be resolved with the use of nanotechnology. Nanomaterials can be metallic, semiconducting, polymer, or carbon-based and have been widely employed in studies and have been shown to be effective against infections on the WHO priority list. Antibacterial activity of nanomaterials arises from interactions between nanoparticles and bacteria, which includes cellular uptake and nanoparticle aggregation, which leads to membrane damage and toxicity. In an effort to reduce resistance, nanoparticles can serve as both antibiotics and delivery systems [61,62,63]. Metal-based NPs (such as silver, copper and gold) have drawn attention due to their different properties such as being optically active, having a large surface area, being chemically reactive, as well as mechanically strong. Favorable physicochemical characteristics of metallic nanomaterials led them to be widely used in biomedical applications [64,65]. In order to circumvent vancomycin resistance, a short half-life, and the necessity for a greater dose, Yadav et al. [66] used a nanosized vehicle system for delayed and sustained release of the antibiotic. Vancomycin was captured using arginine-\u03b1,\u03b2-dehydrophenylalanine nanospheres in the procedure. When compared to vancomycin alone, which only moderately inhibited S. aureus growth in in vitro and in vivo tests, nanoparticles effectively inhibited S. aureus growth. The antibacterial therapy holds out a lot of promise thanks to the delivery mechanism. A sliver nanoparticle conjugated with chitosan was created by Mohammadinejat et al. [67] and tested for antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The results showed that, compared to chitosan (64, 16 \u03bcg/mL) and Ag Np alone (32, 16 \u03bcg/mL), the nanoparticle conjugate had a MIC90 of 8 \u03bcg/mL against CRAB isolates and 4 \u03bcg/mL against MRSA. Ag Np\u2013chitosan conjugation is a successful alternative with antibacterial and anti-biofilm effects against CRAB and MRSA isolates, as demonstrated by the conjugate\u2019s ability to reduce biofilm formation of CRAB and MRSA isolates by \u00bc MIC concentration (2 \u03bcg/mL) and \u00bd MIC concentration (2 \u03bcg/mL), respectively. Polydopamine (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,2-diol, PDA) has strong hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, and Na Xu et al. [68] designed ferrous sulfide-polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA@FeS NPs) in which ferrous and sulfur ions preserve normal body physiology. The photothermal antibacterial activities of PDA@FeS NPs were very effective against both E. coli and S. aureus. When hydrogen peroxide is present, the near-infrared (NIR) light-mediated release of ferrous ions under weakly acidic conditions (approximately 26.5%) caused the generation of harmful hydroxyl radicals (.OH), which caused bacterial cell membrane damage and content leakage. PDA@FeS NPs\u2019 germicidal properties offer a fresh approach for creating new antibacterial platforms. Moreover, Li et al. [69] created a positively charged porphyrin iron-based porous organic polymer called FePPOPHydantoin that generates a significant quantity of hydroxyl radicals. FePPOPHydantoin provided strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption, superior stability, high density of surface catalytic centers, and reproducibility. In addition, it gave a multi-amplified antibacterial efficacy by combining photo-Fenton and peroxidase mimetic catalytic treatment. The efficiency of the nanozymes against bacterial infection was demonstrated in an in vivo study using infected mice with S. aureus. Furthermore, at the nanoscale range, diamagnetic silver nanoparticles (Ag) are renowned for their antiviral, anticancer, and antibacterial effects. El-Bassuony [70] investigated the results of combining ferromagnetic (cobalt) and paramagnetic (copper) components with silver-magnetite nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that, compared to copper nanoferrite (CuAF), cobalt nanoferrite/silver-magnetite (CoAF) nanocomposites produced a more dramatic effect in the magnetic experiments. This is due to the higher coercivity Hc and saturation magnetization Ms of CoAF. Both nanocomposites shown robust antimicrobial activities when tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, indicating the potential application of nanomaterials as antibacterial agents. Human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5) antimicrobial peptide (AMP) was coupled with myristic acid (tetradecanoic acid) to produce Myristoylated HD5 nanobiotics in a method utilized by Lei et al. [71] to induce self-assembly. Cationicity and hydrophobicity are both critical for killing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Human alpha-defensins clustered in nanoassemblies combine these two characteristics for efficiently killing bacteria. Furthermore, the nanobiotic showed resistance to proteolytic degradation in vivo, and minimization of renal excretion due to increased molecular size which led to the improvement of the bioavailability of the HD5-myr nanobiotic. The self-assembled nanobiotic shown improved broad-spectrum bactericidal action specifically against E. coli and MRSA by disrupting the cell wall and possibly other membrane structures, according to in vitro data. Excellent tolerability was also demonstrated in in vivo testing, where it was discovered that the nanobiotic could protect mice from MRSA skin infections and save them from E. coli-induced sepsis [72].\n\n## Implementation of Quality by Design (QbD) Approach in Nano-Delivery\nThe phrase \u201cquality by design\u201d (QbD) refers to products that are free of contamination and provide the consumer with the therapeutic benefit stated on the label. The FDA promotes the application of QbD concepts in the creation, production, and oversight of pharmaceutical products. The QbD technique strengthens development capability, speed, formulation design, and the manufacturer\u2019s capacity to pinpoint the underlying reasons of manufacturing failures, which increases the effectiveness of product development and production. It also infuses quality into the product itself [73,74]. By employing a methodical QbD technique, Joshi et al. [75] created rifampicin-loaded bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (RIF-BSA-NPs) with optimal particle size and entrapment effectiveness for useful intravenous use. The 72 h sustained release of rifampicin from the BSA NPs matrix indicates that the formulated NP is appropriate for intravenous administration with the potential to enhance rifampicin\u2019s therapeutic effects. The sulfonamide antibiotic Silver Sulphadiazine (Silver [(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl](pyrimidin-2-yl)azanide, SSD), which is an efficient antibacterial drug used for treating burn wounds, was examined by Thakur et al. [76] using the QbD paradigm. The penetration and retention efficacy of the medicine was increased by SSD in an organo-gel foundation based on egg oil, according to the results. Furthermore, the prolonged release of the medication from the body decreased the need for frequent application and the creation of scars, which improved patient compliance. Because of this, SSD egg oil organogel holds promise as a delivery strategy for the treatment of burn wounds and associated infections. Systematic QbD was utilized by Ghodake et al. [77] to create a dry powder inhaler of sodium cefoperazone (1, Figure 9) based on liposomes. The effectiveness of liposomes as an anti-biofilm agent against P. aeruginosa was examined. The first crucial step in quality-based development is defining the target product profile (TPP), which is a summary of a drug product\u2019s quality attributes including the route of administration, dosage form, pharmacokinetic parameters, and others. The final dosage form was a dry powder which was filled into capsules to be administered via pulmonary inhalation. Particle size and % entrapment efficiency were also selected as important quality attributes (CQAs) to guarantee the quality of the finished product. When compared to the free drug, the cefoperazone liposomal formulation demonstrated stability, nanometer-sized particle size, high drug entrapment, and enhanced in vitro antibacterial, antibiofilm, and eradication at almost 1 g/mL. For the formulation to be employed for the treatment of P. aeruginosa-related lung infections after cystic fibrosis, more testing is required. For the development of drugs and reliable quality control, a thorough understanding of QbD-based processes and design spaces is crucial. These spaces correspond to the critical process parameters (CPPs). A complex liposomal amphotericin B (AmB) product was created by Liu et al. [78] and improved utilizing the QbD technique. Research has demonstrated that the manufacturing technique, formulation ingredients, and curing temperature applied during the production process\u2014and more specifically, the hydration and microfluidization\u2014have a significant impact on the drug\u2019s efficacy. Moreover, the design space was investigated for the reliable creation of a therapeutic product with undesirable qualities. The broad design space was observed at higher curing temperatures, lower di-stearoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DSPG)-to-phospholipid ratios, and greater active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to phospholipid ratios. Although AMPs offer a viable alternative to antibiotics, problems with toxicity and low bioavailability still need to be resolved. To get beyond these obstacles, Qbd-based antimicrobial peptide modification and formulation design are presented by Manteghi et al. [79] in order to create a more stable, affordable, and effective delivery to the target location. In addition to the immune system\u2019s manufacture of antibodies, it was discovered that PEGylation of AMPs causes a decrease in biological activity due to the loss of its positive charges. The possible dangers associated with the AMP PEGylation process were examined using the AMP model PGLa (GMASKAGAIAGKIAKVALKAL-NH2). The parameters used to prioritize rankings included final size, conjugate activity, and specificity. The development of an optimum formulation of PGLa for a possible drug delivery system results from taking into account all the important criteria and choosing the best procedures and materials. As a result, the early pharmaceutical developments integrated by QbD technique aids researchers in risk-based product optimization. Understanding the cause-and-effect relationships during the initial Risk Assessment (RA) process provides the foundation for the experimental design and development support to obtain the final product within the desired quality range.\n\n## 5.2.1. In Silico Modelling\nIn silico modeling is a term used to describe computer-assisted experimentation that combines the benefits of both in vivo and in vitro research. Almost limitless parameters can be used in in silico models to provide knowledge that is not ethically or practically possible to gather via conventional methods. In medicine and therapies, computational models or simulations enable predictions and lead to discoveries [80,81]. Wet-lab and in silico approaches are useful in the quick identification of new lead AMPs candidates, according to Oyama et al. [82] The rumen metagenomic dataset was used to perform prediction and similarity analysis of AMPs. Among 829 sequences, six AMPs were found and demonstrated to have potential action. Two of these six possibilities, designated as HG2 (MKKLLLILFCLALALAGCKKAP) and HG4 (VLGLALIVGGALLIKKKQAKS) for additional characterization, were found. With negligible toxicity to human primary cell lines, experimental evaluation and characterization of HG2 and HG4 indicated antibacterial efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria. The suppression of other cellular processes and contact with the cytoplasmic membrane of target cells are examples of possible mechanisms of action. These peptides may be used safely as alternative treatments with antibiofilm action for the treatment of bacterial infections because of their non-toxic effect and in vivo efficacy against MRSA USA300 infection in the Galleria mellonella infection model. With the purpose of discovering less expensive antibacterial therapeutic medications, a study by Masalha et al. [83] combined a set of 628 antibacterial pharmaceuticals with active domains and 2892 natural products with inactive domains. A highly discriminative model was built using the iterative stochastic elimination (ISE) technique to index natural materials for their antibacterial bioactivity. Ten natural compounds scored highly as potential antibacterial medication candidates, allowing virtual screening to identify 72% of the antibacterial medicines. Caffeine and ricinine (2 and 3, respectively, in Figure 9) were the two molecules among ten natural products that were found and tested for their antibacterial action. To speed up the process of finding new drugs, the precisely designed prediction model can be used for virtual screening of enormous chemical databases. In the AfroDb database, there are more than 16,000 African plant structures that have well-calculated ADMET attributes. Alhadrami et al. [84] investigated the possible antibacterial action of medicinal plants from North Africa, particularly against the D-alanine-D-alanine ligase (Ddl-B) or DNA gyrase B subunits (Gyr-B) or both of the E. coli enzymes. The crystal structures of E. coli Ddl-B and Gyr-B served as the basis for the beginning of structural-based virtual screening. The top-scoring hits were anthraquinones (4, Figure 9), and their efficacy against Ddl-B, Gyr-B, multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli, MRSA, and VRSA was examined in vitro. Some of the tested derivatives, including emodin and chrysophanol (5 and 6, respectively, in Figure 9), demonstrated strong micromolar enzyme inhibition as well as antibacterial activity against the bacteria in question with MIC values ranging from 2\u201364 \u03bcg/mL and low to moderate cellular cytotoxicity. These discoveries represent an important step in the creation of new antibacterial drugs to combat MDR strains. In silico molecular docking was employed in Ali\u2019s study [85] to examine ten naturally occurring marine fungus derived chemicals against a mutant enzyme from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The SWISS-ADME database investigated the chemicals to determine their non-toxicity. Elipyrone A (7, Figure 9) with six hydrogen bonds was the best compound when the compounds\u2019 binding affinity, chemical interactions, and toxicity were examined. Speck-Planche et al. [86] constructed a multitasking model for quantitative-structure biological effect relationships to study anti-Pseudomonas activities and ADMET features of organic compounds (mtk-QSBER). To evaluate the created model, delafloxacin (8, Figure 9) was employed as a case study. The drug\u2019s outstanding similarity to experimental testing was revealed by the results, confirming the model\u2019s value for virtually screening anti-Pseudomonas medicines. Thymoquinone (TQ), a phytoconstituent of Nigella sativa essential oil with possible antibacterial activity, was investigated by Qureshi et al. [87]. TQ was molecularly docked in silico against a number of antibacterial target proteins. S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were the bacterial and fungal strains that were most vulnerable to TQ. N-myristoyltransferase from Candida albicans, NADPH-dependent D-xylose reductase from Candida tenuis, D-alanyl-D-alanine synthetase (Ddl) from Thermus thermophilus, and transcriptional regulator qacR from S. aureus are the four preferred target proteins for TQ as determined by in silico molecular docking. The most effective binding, according to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, was between TQ and Ddl or NADPH-dependent D-xylose reductase. The study emphasizes TQ\u2019s promising effectiveness against multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections, particularly Candida albicans and Gram-positive bacteria. A total of 45 strains of the zoonotic and foodborne pathogen Aliarcobacter butzleri (A. butzleri) were examined by M\u00fcller et al. [88] utilizing the gradient strip diffusion method and whole-genome sequencing for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Erythromycin, doxycycline, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and streptomycin resistance were found in German strains. Possible resistance mechanisms were identified using in silico resistance profile prediction which utilized a specially created database (ARCO IBIZ AMR). GyrA point mutation and ciprofloxacin resistance have a strong link, and ampicillin resistance and bla3 gene have a weaker correlation. Moreover, in silico virulence profiling revealed a whole lipid A cluster presents in all examined A. butzleri genomes as well as a broad spectrum of putative virulence markers.\n\n## 5.2.2. Fragment-Based Drug Design (FBDD)\nFragment-based drug design (FBDD), whose library contains thousands of fragments, is a potent method for creating lead compounds. Novel and potent inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) enzyme 2-trans-enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) was designed using FBDD by Sabbah et al. [89] Using Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray, 18 hits were found after screening a library of 800 pieces. NMR and X-ray techniques were used to confirm the found hits. Although the fragment hits had no discernible inhibitory activity, molecular docking and the fragment-growing technique allowed for the development of effective and new InhA nanomolar inhibitors. With submicromolar IC50 values, the insertion of a benzothiophenene resulted in the synthesis of powerful inhibitors of InhA, such as the N- [3-(aminomethyl)phenyl]-5-chloro-3-methylbenzothio-phene-2-sulfonamide (10, Figure 9). Notwithstanding the actual minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations, it is important to investigate additional factors including resistance, stability, and ADME characteristics. According to the study, FBDD is a useful method for creating novel inhibitors [89,90]. Several Mtb enzymes are also being explored as potential targets for developing new drugs, such as Decaprenylphosphoryl-\u03b2-D-ribose 2\u2032-epimerase (DprE1), which is involved in the metabolic pathway responsible for cell wall structure [91,92]; \u03b2-ketoacyl-AcpM synthase (KasA), which is crucial for fatty acid biosynthesis; a transcriptional repressor (EthR), Antigen 85 (Ag85), which is involved in the mycolic acid synthetic pathway; and 7,8- diaminopelargonic acid synthase (BioA), which play a vital role in the biosynthesis of the biotin pathway and arginine biosynthesis pathway [91]. DprE1 inhibitors have been identified as piperidinylpyrimidine derivatives (11, Figure 9) by Borthwick et al. [93] during initial screening utilizing SAR with MIC90 values of 30.6 \u03bcM and 15.6 \u03bcM. The newly found substance has shown positive in vivo results against acute Mtb. FBDD was utilized by several scientists to identify hit compounds for these targets. Thiolactomycin (TLM) (12, Figure 9) and pantetheine analog (PK940) (13, Figure 9) were created as KasA enzyme inhibitors by Kapilashrami et al. [94]. BDM31369, BDM31827, and 4-Iodo-N-prop-2-ynylbenzenesulfonamide (BDM43266); (14, 15, and 16, respectively in Figure 9), were identified by Villemagne et al. [95] as several hit compounds for EthR by library screening to treat MDR-TB. Tetrahydro-1-benzothiophene (THBTP) Analogues (17, Figure 9) against Ag85 were discovered by Scheich and Mendes et al. [96,97]. Through fragment screening, Dai et al. [98] discovered a powerful aryl hydrazine inhibitor of BioA 2-(aminomethyl)benzothiazole (18, Figure 9). The role of ArgB, ArgC, ArgD, and ArgF enzymes in the L-arginine production pathway in Mtb is highlighted by Gupta et al. [99], who also confirmed a hit compound against ArgB. The findings demonstrated that compounds NMR446 and L-canavanine (19 and 20, respectively, in Figure 9) significantly suppressed the growth of M. tuberculosis. The new compound N-(5-(azepan-1-ylsulfonyl)-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydrophthalazin-1-yl) acetamide (21, Figure 9), which was re-covered from a previous lead compound with a unique binding mode (non-conserved allosteric site), was identified by Whitehouse et al. [100] using high throughput screening (HTS) and fragment-based methods (e.g., DSF) against fumarate hydratase and Mtb H37Rv bacteria [101].\n\n## 5.3.1. Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs)\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are organic substances found in all kingdoms of life, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. In addition to negatively charged microbial membranes, AMPs may also target intracellular components such as ribosomes, specific prote",
