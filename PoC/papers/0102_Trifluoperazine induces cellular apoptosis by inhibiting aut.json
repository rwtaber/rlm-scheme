  "title": "Trifluoperazine induces cellular apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy and targeting NUPR1 in multiple myeloma.",
  "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells. Recent modern combination therapies have improved survival rates, but many patients develop resistance to novel drugs, leading to relapse. Trifluoperazine (TFP), a typical antipsychotic drug, has been reported to exert antitumor effects by targeting various pathways. Thus far, the role of TFP in MM has not been elucidated. In the current study, we demonstrated that TFP inhibited cell growth and autophagy activity but induced apoptosis of U266 and RPMI 8226 MM cells. Furthermore, cotreatment of these cell lines with TFP and rapamycin, a potent autophagy inducer, reduced cell apoptosis compared with TFP treatment alone. We also found that TFP inhibited nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) expression. In the presence of TFP, cells stably overexpressing NUPR1 showed a higher viability than cells treated with the nonspecific control. Autophagy suppression and apoptosis induction caused by TFP were also reversed in MM cells upon NUPR1 overexpression. Overall, our results indicate that in the context of MM, TFP targets NUPR1, inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis by autophagy inhibition. Our results could contribute toward efforts for the development of more effective therapies for MM to be tested in future clinical trials.",

  "full_text": "## Cell culture\nThe MM cell lines (U266 and RPMI 8226) were donated by J. Hou of the Affiliated Renji Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University (Shanghai, China). Cells were maintained in RPMI\u20101640 medium (Gibco, New York, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAN, Germany), and were cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.\n\n## Cell transfection and agents\nNUPR1 lentiviral vectors (LVs) and nonspecific control (NC) LVs were synthesized and produced as previously described by Shanghai GeneChem Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) [14]. We seeded approximately 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells per well in a 24\u2010well plate, and then added the corresponding LVs for a multiplicity of infection of 100. After 12\u00a0h, we removed the LVs. The transfected cells were selected by Solarbio (Beijing, China). Transfection efficiency was assessed by detecting green fluorescent protein using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.\nTrifluoperazine (purity\u00a0>\u00a099.0%) and rapamycin were purchased from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA).\n\n## Cell counting Kit\u20108 assay\nCultured MM cells were seeded in 96\u2010well plates (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 cells per well), subjected to TFP treatment at different concentrations, and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. To each well, 10\u00a0\u03bcL of Cell Counting Kit\u20108 reagent (CCK\u20108; Bimake, Houston, TX, USA) was added. After incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h, the wells were assessed with a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at an absorbance of 450\u00a0nm.\n\n## Lactate dehydrogenase assay\nWe used a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity test kit (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan) to detect released LDH from the cytosol. After treatment with 30\u00a0\u03bcm TFP for 24\u00a0h, approximately 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 MM cells of each group were inoculated per well of a 96\u2010well plate. We added 50 \u03bcL of medium containing the test substance that was adjusted to the desired concentration and incubated the plate at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0h in a CO2 incubator. Then, we added 10\u00a0\u03bcL of lysis buffer to each well of the high control, and the plate was incubated once more at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. After adding 100\u00a0\u03bcL of working solution to each well, we incubated the plate at room temperature for 30\u00a0min and then added 50\u00a0\u03bcL of stop solution. The absorbance at 490\u00a0nm was measured, and the relative cytotoxicity was calculated from the amount of released LDH divided by the amount of total LDH.\n\n## Reverse transcription\u2013quantitative polymerase chain reaction\nAfter treatment with TFP for 24\u00a0h, U266 and RPMI 8226 cells were gently centrifuged and collected. RNAiso Plus was used to extract the total RNA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNA was then synthesized using the Prime Script\u2122 RT reagent kit. Reverse transcription\u2013quantitative real\u2010time PCR (RT\u2010qPCR) analysis was performed using a CFX96 Real\u2010Time PCR System with a SYBR Premix Ex Taq\u2122 II PCR Kit. The primers for NUPR1 were as follows: forward, 5'\u2010AGGACTTATTCCCGCTGACTGA\u20103' and reverse, 5'\u2010TGCCGTGCGTGTCTATTTATTG\u20103'; \u03b2\u2010actin: forward, 5'\u2010CCACGAAACTACCTTCAACTCC\u20103' and reverse, 5'\u2010GTGATCTCCTTCTGCATCCTGT\u20103'. The relative gene expression was analyzed by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Cq method. All reagents used for RT\u2010qPCR were purchased from TaKaRa (Dalian, China).\n\n## Western blot analysis\nU266 and RPMI 8226 cells were harvested and lysed with cell lysis buffer (poly(N\u2010isopropylacrylamide) (PIPA) mixed with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at a ratio of 100:\u00a01, Beyotime, Shanghai, China. We then measured the concentration of the extracted protein using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Beyotime) and balanced the concentration. Proteins in equal amounts (20\u201330\u00a0\u03bcg) were added to different wells of pre\u2010prepared gels, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE), and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk for 2\u00a0h, the PVDF membranes were subject to incubation with the primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti\u2010human NUPR1 antibody (1:\u00a01000, Novus, St Charles, MO, USA); LC3, P62, and cleaved caspase 3 (1\u00a0:\u00a01000, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA); and BCL2, BAX, and GAPDH (1\u00a0:\u00a01500, Affinity, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The membranes were washed three times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase\u2010conjugated secondary antibody (1\u00a0:\u00a03000, CST) for 1\u00a0h. We then washed the membranes again three times. Protein bands were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Beyotime) with the FUSION FX imaging analysis system (Vilber Lourmat, France). The relative expression was obtained by dividing the band density of the target protein by the density of glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) obtained using\u00a0Fusion software. LC3 analysis was evaluated by the ratio of the band density of LC3 II and LC3 I.\n\n## Flow cytometry\nAfter TFP treatment for 24\u00a0h, the seeded approximately 106 MM cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS). Cells at different stages of apoptosis were distinguished with Annexin V\u2010APC/propidium iodide (PI) staining (Syngene, China) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Apoptosis analysis was performed on a FACS flow cytometer with cellquest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).\n\n## Transmission electron microscopy\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) was applied to evaluate cell autophagy. Cells treated with 30\u00a0\u03bcm TFP for 24\u00a0h and untreated control cells were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Fixation in OsO4 was then performed, and the cells were encapsulated in agarose. Collected cells were then dehydrated, embedded, and polymerized in Spurr resin. Ultrathin sections were obtained and double\u2010stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Grids were observed on a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan). At least 200 cells from 4 grids were analyzed for each set.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nAll analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA) and SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) software, with at least three independent experiments that are presented as the mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD. Statistically significant differences between two groups were assessed using an unpaired Student\u2019s t\u2010test. The comparison of three or four groups was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences were considered statistically significant when */#P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, **/##P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, and ***P\u00a0<\u00a00.001.\n\n## TFP inhibits growth and autophagy but induces apoptosis of MM cells\nConsidering that TFP plays an inhibitory role in various tumors [5, 15], we treated MM cells with different concentrations of TFP (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40\u00a0\u03bcm) to investigate the role of TFP in MM. After treatment for 24\u00a0h, we performed the CCK\u20108 assay to evaluate the cell viability. As shown in Fig.\u00a01A, cell viability exhibited a downward trend as TFP concentration increased. The IC50 values of TFP were 20\u00a0\u03bcm for U266 and 25\u00a0\u03bcm for RPMI 8226 cells. After obtaining this information, we proceeded to determine the effects of TFP on MM cell death.\nTo further study the mechanism of TFP affecting MM cell death, we firstly examined U266 and RPMI 8226 cells as they underwent autophagy after TFP treatment. TEM analysis was performed to assess the autophagy activity by monitoring autophagosomes. We found that the autophagy level was decreased in the TFP\u2010treated group compared with the control (Fig.\u00a01B). Western blot further confirmed this observation, showing that the ratio of LC3 II/LC3 I was reduced and P62 expression was upregulated (Fig.\u00a01C). The results indicated that the autophagic activity was inhibited in MM cells following treatment with TFP. Secondly, we measured LDH release to evaluate cell death by necrosis in the presence of TFP. There was no significant difference in LDH release (Fig.\u00a02A), suggesting that TFP did not exert pronecrotic effects on U266 or RPMI 8226 cells. Additionally, we investigated the effect of TFP on cell apoptosis. As depicted in Fig.\u00a02B, flow cytometry revealed that the apoptosis rate was higher in the TFP\u2010treated group than that in the control. Western blot also showed that the expression of antiapoptotic BCL2 was downregulated, and the expression of cleaved caspase 3 and proapoptotic factor BAX was upregulated in the TFP\u2010treated group (Fig.\u00a01C). Together, these findings suggested that TFP played an integral role in inhibiting growth and autophagy, but induced apoptosis rather than necrosis in MM cells.\n\n## TFP induces cell apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy in MM\nAutophagy and apoptosis often affect each other in MM cells. Observing apoptotic changes after autophagy intervention can help distinguish whether autophagy\u2010mediated apoptosis or autophagic death occurred. To test whether autophagy inhibition caused by TFP was related to cytotoxicity, we cotreated MM cells with TFP and rapamycin, a common autophagy inducer, and detected cell death. Western blot showed that increased expression of autophagy\u2010related proteins and decreased levels of apoptosis\u2010related proteins were observed in the cotreatment as compared to the TFP group (Fig.\u00a02C). We also used flow cytometry to observe that cotreatment with TFP and rapamycin downregulated the apoptosis rate compared with TFP treatment alone (Fig.\u00a02B). TFP\u2010induced apoptosis was significantly reversed by autophagy activation caused by rapamycin. Collectively, we demonstrated that TFP induced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy in MM cells.\n\n## TFP targets NUPR1 and induces apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy\nA study in pancreatic adenocarcinoma has suggested that TFP binds to NUPR1 through the region around amino acid Thr68 [7], indicating that TFP could act as an NUPR1 inhibitor [13]. It was unclear whether NUPR1 was involved in the effects exerted by TFP on MM. We therefore evaluated the expression of NUPR1 in MM cells after TFP treatment. TFP exhibited strong inhibition of NUPR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels (Fig.\u00a03A,B), which indicated that NUPR1 might play a role in the effects of TFP on MM cells.\nTo understand whether TFP affected autophagy or apoptosis through regulation of NUPR1, we transfected NC\u2010LV and NUPR1\u2010LV into MM cells and constructed stable NUPR1\u2010overexpressing U266 and RPMI 8226 cells. The overexpressing effects were verified by RT\u2010qPCR and western blot (Fig.\u00a03C,D). We then treated the NC\u2010LV and NUPR1\u2010LV groups with TFP and examined the cell viability by CCK\u20108. The results showed that cell viability was restrained after TFP treatment, but the viability of NUPR1\u2010overexpressing cells was higher than that of the NC\u2010LV group (Fig.\u00a04A). We also detected the expression of autophagic and apoptotic markers by western blot. The results showed that there was no statistical difference in the expression of the aforementioned proteins between the TFP\u2010treated group and TFP\u2010treated NC\u2010LV group, but the autophagy level was upregulated and apoptosis was downregulated in the TFP\u2010treated NUPR1\u2010LV group compared with the TFP\u2010treated NC\u2010LV group (Fig.\u00a04B). NUPR1 overexpression reversed the autophagic suppression and cellular apoptosis induction caused by TFP in U266 and RPMI 8226 cells. Thus, we concluded that TFP targeted NUPR1 in MM cells and subsequently induced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy.\n\n## Discussion\nDespite initial clinical success in treating MM with modern combination therapies, many patients eventually relapse. Re\u2010evaluating old drugs in context with their potential helpful or harmful effects on cancer might identify new alternative compounds for future MM treatment. Here, we focused on TFP, an approved antipsychotic drug. We studied its roles in treating MM in vitro for the first time. We found that TFP targeted NUPR1 in U266 and RPMI 8226 cells and then suppressed cell viability and induced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy.\nStudies have shown that TFP plays an anticancer role in several cancer types. It was suggested as a potential agent for tumor growth inhibition in colorectal cancer [5]. This effect was accompanied by induction of apoptosis and autophagy. TFP was also shown to increase radio sensitivity in glioblastoma by impairing homologous recombination [6]. Furthermore, it has been reported that TFP induces downregulation of the P\u2010gp protein in adriamycin\u2010resistant L1210 leukemia cells and restores sensitivity to doxorubicin [16]. TFP was also identified as one of the most significant potential agents for MM treatment [10], showing great value in drug development.\nIn the current study, we focused on the role of TFP in cell death, which consists of necrosis and programmed cell death such as apoptosis, autophagy, and some new types. We found that TFP impaired cell viability and exerted considerable proapoptotic effects on U266 and RPMI 8226 cells. These findings are in contrast with previously reported results, showing that TFP promoted proliferation and reduced calcium\u2010dependent apoptosis in glioma cells [17]. Additionally, it was reported that TFP promoted cell death by apoptosis and necroptosis in pancreatic cancer [13]. However, our results showed that TFP had no effect on the necrosis of MM cells. These differences could be explained by the supposition that different cells respond differently to the same drug due to their different biological properties.\nAs the other type of programmed cell death, autophagy is usually a survival mechanism in which cellular homeostasis is maintained through lysosomal recycling of unnecessary and damaged cell components. Plasma cells and MM cells present high autophagy activity, promoting cell survival and leading to drug resistance [18, 19]. During high levels of damage, however, the normal autophagy balance might be disrupted [20]. Autophagy largely depends on stimuli or the cellular environment, and apoptosis may return later, or it may be antagonized or delayed. The two processes could act in a mutually exclusive manner or serve as backup mechanisms for each other, causing cell death. Considering that TFP has been reported to regulate autophagy and autophagic cell death in multiple cancers [5, 6, 8], we investigated the autophagic levels of MM cells following TFP treatment. The observation of the formation of autophagosomes by TEM proved the idea that TFP inhibited the autophagic activity of MM cells. Furthermore, the decreased conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II and accumulation of P62 following TFP treatment indicated the potential disruption of autophagosome formation during autophagy. Moreover, induction of autophagy by rapamycin antagonized the process of cell apoptosis caused by TFP. In MM cells, TFP did not induce autophagy, but rather, it was inhibited. When the process was activated by rapamycin, TFP opposed the mechanism of death induced by the compound. We thus came to the conclusion that TFP caused cellular apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy rather than autophagic death.\nNUPR1 is a widely studied molecule, fulfilling different roles in many diseases [7, 21, 22]. It is an intrinsic disorder protein induced by cellular stress and can directly regulate transcription by combining PDGFA, SNAP25, and other gene promoters [21, 23, 24]. NUPR1 thus has a wide range of regulatory effects on cell growth, death, and DNA damage response. We have previously reported that NUPR1 is overexpressed in MM cells, and its silencing induces autophagy\u2010mediated apoptosis [25, 26]. Some NUPR1\u2010related drugs, including TFP and luminespib, have already been shown to have antitumor effects [13, 27]. By binding to NUPR1, TFP inhibits its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [7]. Through this inhibition, TFP was reported to induce programmed cell death in pancreatic cancer [13]. Moreover, the combination of adeno\u2010associated virus\u2010mediated NUPR1 knockdown and TFP induced premature senescence in lung cancer cells [28]. In the current study, we found that TFP attenuated the expression of NUPR1 at both protein and mRNA levels in U266 and RPMI 8226 cells. In the presence of TFP, cells overexpressing NUPR1 exhibited higher cell viability than the nonspecific control. We also showed that NUPR1 overexpression counteracted TFP\u2010caused autophagy suppression and apoptosis induction. We therefore concluded that TFP regulated cellular autophagy and apoptosis in MM by targeting NUPR1.\nIn addition, proteasome inhibition by bortezomib, an approved first\u2010line drug for MM, was shown to increase pancreatic cancer cell sensitivity to TFP [15]. In subsequent experiments, further study should be conducted to determine the association between TFP and bortezomib in MM.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, our findings show that TFP exhibits significant antitumor effects on MM cells treated in vitro. Our study elucidates the behavior of TFP, which induces cellular apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy in MM, at least in part by targeting NUPR1. We provide a proof\u2010of\u2010concept study for the repurposing of TFP as a novel therapeutic agent for MM.\n\n## Author contributions\nAnmao Li and Xuanxin Chen contributed equally to this work and should be considered cofirst authors.
