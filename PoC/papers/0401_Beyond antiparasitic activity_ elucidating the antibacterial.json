  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Antimicrobial resistance represents a critical global health threat, demanding innovative therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigate the repurposing potential of pyrvinium pamoate (PP)-a long-established anthelmintic agent-for antibacterial applications. Comprehensive in vitro analyses revealed that while gram-negative bacteria exhibited inherent resistance due to limited drug uptake, gram-positive pathogens, particularly within the orders Actinomycetales and Bacillales, were markedly susceptible at low micromolar concentrations. Enhanced antibacterial efficacy was observed when PP was combined with outer membrane-permeabilizing agents, such as the peptide D11 or pentamidine, which facilitated increased intracellular accumulation. Additionally, the role of efflux pump activity was explored; its inhibition in Staphylococcus aureus resulted in significant drug retention and a concomitant reduction in minimum inhibitory concentrations, while disruption of the proton motive force attenuated uptake. The compound demonstrated bactericidal effects against S. aureus and a bacteriostatic profile against Pseudomonas aeruginosa when sensitized with outer membrane permeabilizing agents. Furthermore, synergistic studies with several antibiotics revealed the potential of PP as a valuable addition to the antimicrobial arsenal against multidrug-resistant pathogens. These findings motivate further mechanistic studies and clinical evaluation of PP in antimicrobial therapy. PP shows promise as a repurposed antibacterial agent, particularly against gram-positive pathogens, with enhanced activity against gram-negative pathogens when combined with membrane-permeabilizing agents or in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors. IMPORTANCE: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global crisis that threatens the effectiveness of current treatments. Developing new antibiotics is challenging and time-consuming, so repurposing existing drugs offers a faster alternative. Pyrvinium pamoate (PP) is a well-known antiparasitic drug that has also been studied for cancer treatment, but its antibacterial potential has received little attention. In this study, we show that PP is effective in killing several gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, at low doses. Although gram-negative bacteria are more resistant, we found that combining PP with agents that open up bacterial membranes makes these bacteria more vulnerable. Our research also explains how bacteria take in and remove PP, which can affect how well it works. These findings support the idea of repurposing PP as an antibiotic, especially in combination therapies, to help combat multidrug-resistant infections.",

  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the foremost global public health challenges, undermining the effectiveness of existing therapies and contributing to prolonged illnesses, escalating healthcare costs, and increased mortality rates (1). Despite urgent calls to address AMR, the development of new antimicrobial agents has slowed considerably over the past few decades, hindered by scientific, regulatory, and economic barriers (2, 3). Consequently, innovative strategies\u2014ranging from the discovery of novel compounds to the repurposing of existing drugs\u2014are essential to rejuvenate the antibacterial pipeline and combat multidrug-resistant pathogens (4, 5).\nPyrvinium pamoate (PP) is a well-established anthelmintic agent historically used to treat pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) infections in humans (6). Structurally, it is characterized by a cyanine-like core that grants the molecule distinct physicochemical properties, including poor systemic absorption and pronounced tissue-binding capacity (7). Clinically, PP\u2019s efficacy against pinworms has been attributed to its ability to disrupt key metabolic processes within the parasite. In particular, it is believed to interfere with the parasite\u2019s energy metabolism by inhibiting glucose uptake and potentially altering mitochondrial membrane potentials, which ultimately leads to reduced viability of the worm (8). Besides its antihelminthic activity, during the last years, PP has also garnered considerable interest in oncology research, primarily due to its capacity to inhibit the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway\u2014a key driver of cancer cell proliferation and survival in various tumor types (9\u201311). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that PP can suppress the growth of pancreatic, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer cells (among others), often with minimal effects on non-cancerous cells by binding G-quadruplex DNA structures (12\u201315). In addition to targeting Wnt signaling, PP has been shown to exert cytotoxic effects through alterations in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, apparently imitating its parasiticidal properties (16). These findings underscore its potential as a repurposed anticancer agent, with ongoing investigations focused on elucidating its precise molecular targets and optimizing drug formulations to improve efficacy and selectivity in cancer therapy.\nBeyond its recognized anthelmintic and anticancer activity, PP has drawn attention in recent years for its potential antimicrobial properties (17\u201319). Although still under investigation, preliminary findings suggest that it may exhibit activity against certain bacteria, making it a candidate for repurposing as an antibacterial agent. The mechanisms by which PP exerts antibacterial effects have not been conclusively defined, but similarities with its antiparasitic mode of action are possible.\nOur study highlights the potential of PP as an antibacterial agent with selective activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly those within the Actinomycetales and Bacillales orders. This study expands upon this prior knowledge by exploring PP\u2019s antimicrobial spectrum, uptake mechanisms, and potential resistance determinants.\n\n## Antimicrobial profile of PP\nInitially, we evaluated the antimicrobial profile of PP against a panel of gram-negative (n = 8) and gram-positive (n = 16) bacteria. As shown in Fig. 1A (Table S1), all gram-negative strains were resistant at the highest concentration tested (10 \u00b5M), with Enterobacter cloacae exhibiting the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (8.33 \u00b5M, Fig. 1A; Table S1). In contrast, PP displayed good efficacy against gram-positive species, most notably those within the order Actinomycetales (MIC values ranging from 0.26 \u00b5M for C. urealiticum to 1.3 \u00b5M for S. radingae). This was followed by Bacillales (MIC values ranging from 2.5 \u00b5M for B. cereus or S. aureus to 5 \u00b5M for S. epidermidis or L. monocytogenes). Members of the Lactobacillales were generally as resistant as gram-negative bacteria, except for Fadklamia spp., which was the only susceptible strain in that group (MIC 0.625 \u00b5M, Fig. 1A; Table S1).\n\n## PP requires drug uptake across the bacterial membranes to be effective\nWe employed flow cytometry to assess PP uptake in PAO1. As shown in Fig. 1B, no substantial accumulation of PP was observed in PAO1, even after 2 h of exposure, suggesting limited or no entry. In contrast, in the gram-positive bacterium S. aureus, approximately 80% of the cells were stained within 15 min of PP administration, indicating that PP readily penetrates these cells. To further investigate the influence of the outer membrane on PP activity, we evaluated its antimicrobial effect against several gram-negative species in the presence of four outer membrane-perturbing agents: the peptide D11 (20), EDTA, polymyxin B (21), and pentamidine (22) (Table 1). First, we determined the MIC of each agent individually (Table S2). We then measured the MIC of PP in combination with sub-MIC concentrations of these permeabilizers (Table S2).\nAs summarized in Table 1, synergistic effects varied according to both the bacterial strain and the outer membrane-permeabilizing agent. Notably, EDTA failed to exhibit synergy with PP in any instance, suggesting that the removal of divalent cations (e.g., Ca\u00b2+) from the outer membrane does not enhance PP\u2019s activity. Conversely, combining PP with pentamidine significantly reduced its MIC in A. baumannii, E. cloacae, and P. aeruginosa, while polymyxin B produced a similar effect against Escherichia coli, E. cloacae, and S. enterica. Among the outer membrane-permeabilizing agents tested, the peptide D11 proved the most effective, reducing PP\u2019s MIC against all strains, with particularly strong effects observed in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia (Table 1).\nTo validate these findings, we examined PP uptake via flow cytometry in PAO1, using D11 as the permeabilization agent. Fluorescence was measured at 60 and 120 min to quantify compound internalization. As shown in Fig. 1B, PP uptake was time-dependent and significantly higher in the presence of D11 compared with the control without D11 (Fig. 1B; Table S3). This enhanced intracellular accumulation likely underlies the increased antimicrobial activity observed with the D11\u2013PP combination. However, increased uptake alone does not ensure susceptibility. In E. faecalis, which displays high resistance levels to PP (>128 \u00b5M), approximately 60% of cells internalized the compound (Fig. 1B; Table S4), yet no antimicrobial effect was detected (Fig. 1A).\n\n## PP is actively pumped inside the cells and removed by efflux pumps\nConsidering that other gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus spp. or Streptococcus spp. displayed high resistance to PP (Fig. 1A), and the values of PP uptake in E. faecalis (Fig. 1B), we explored alternative resistant mechanisms to PP that could be related to such a resistance.\nFirst, we explored the activity of efflux pumps on PP resistance in three strains: P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S. aureus. For that, we used two families of efflux pump inhibitors CCCP and PA\u03b2N. Initially, the MIC for each drug was determined for each bacteria and then we performed a MIC for PP at sub-MIC concentrations of these efflux pump inhibitors (Table S4). Interestingly, neither CCCP nor PA\u03b2N enhanced the activity of PP in PAO1 or E. faecalis strains, suggesting that either the efflux pumps in these bacteria are not the primary resistance mechanism for PP, or other resistance mechanisms overshadow the effects of this efflux pump inhibitor are taking place. However, in S. aureus, contrasting results were observed for each inhibitor. While PA\u03b2N enhanced the activity of PP, CCCP inhibited its activity. The MIC for PP was reduced from 2.5 to 0.156 \u00b5M in the presence of PA\u03b2N and increased at least to 10 \u00b5M when CCCP was added at sub-MIC concentration. To confirm this effect, we explored the effect of each pump inhibitor on the PP uptake by S. aureus by flow cytometry. When PA\u03b2N was added, a significant increase in the fluorescence for PP was observed, suggesting that the inhibition of efflux pumps results in a drug accumulation inside the cells (Fig. 1D; Table S5) that could be related to the lower MIC observed when added. However, when CCCP was added, fluorescent was strongly reduced, suggesting that PP uptake is dependent on an intact membrane PMF (Fig. 1D; Table S5). In fact, a similar effect was observed when another PMF disruptor was added (FCCP), the MIC for PP was also increased (5 \u00b5M). When we tested other efflux pump inhibitors such as verapamil or reserpine with verified activity against S. aureus (23) and E. faecalis (24), no activity was observed for E. faecalis, and neither or just modest antimicrobial activity (1.25 \u00b5M for verapamil) was observed for S. aureus (Table S4). Considering these findings, we assessed PP efflux in S. aureus and E. faecalis using flow cytometry. As depicted in Fig. 2A (Table S6), PP was retained in S. aureus, whereas it was actively expelled from E. faecalis. These results suggest that E. faecalis harbors an efflux system unresponsive to PA\u03b2N, reserpine, or verapamil, while S. aureus appears to rely on a more limited, PA\u03b2N-sensitive efflux mechanism.\n\n## PP is bactericidal for \nNext, we investigated the biocidal activity of PP against S. aureus and PAO1 to determine whether its effect was bactericidal or bacteriostatic. To this end, we performed a standard MIC assay, followed by subculturing 10 \u00b5L from the first well showing no visible growth in the fresh culture medium. For S. aureus, no differences were observed between the MIC and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), indicating that these compounds exhibit bactericidal activity (Fig. 2B). Notably, the MBC was reduced in the presence of PA\u03b2N and abolished by CCCP (Fig. 2B). For PAO1, we assessed the MBC following MIC determination in the presence of D11. Despite an MIC of <0.01 \u00b5M, the MBC exceeded 10 \u00b5M (Fig. 2C), suggesting that in this gram-negative bacterium, the synergistic effect is bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. We also evaluated the dead kinetics in the case of S. aureus. For that, we tested 0.5\u00d7 MIC, MIC, and 2\u00d7 MIC concentrations of PP in MHB inoculated with 106 CFU/mL. As depicted in Fig. 2D, just after 1 h of treatment with PP, almost all bacteria disappear from the plate. After 2 or 3 h of treatment, some colonies were detected in the 0.5\u00d7 MIC. At 6 h no colonies were detected (<1,000 CFU/mL). However, after 24 h, the cells were recovered at 0.5x MIC, but not at the MIC (Fig. 2D).\n\n## Combined activity with antibiotics\nSynergy with conventional antibiotics can enhance overall efficacy, enabling lower doses and fewer side effects. By combining complementary mechanisms, it may also help curb resistance and prolong the usefulness of both new and established antimicrobials. Accordingly, we tested the combined activity of PP with eight antibiotics from different classes\u2014gentamicin (GEN), kanamycin (KAN), levofloxacin (LEV), ciprofloxacin (CIP), azithromycin (AZI), tetracycline (TET), doxycycline (DOX), and rifampicin (RIF)\u2014against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.\nIn an initial fixed-concentration screen (0.25\u00d7 MIC PP for S. aureus; 10 \u00b5M PP for P. aeruginosa PAO1), antibiotic MIC shifts were modest overall in S. aureus, whereas several combinations in P. aeruginosa were antagonistic (Fig. 2E). To comprehensively assess interactions, we performed checkerboard assays across a range of PP concentrations and calculated fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI). In S. aureus, synergy was observed with TET and CIP (Fig. 2E; Fig. S1), and a significant MIC reduction was also seen with DOX (Fig. 2E). Additive effects were noted for some combinations with LEV, AZI, and RIF, while the combination with KAN was antagonistic (Fig. 2E; Fig. S1). In contrast, in the gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa PAO1, PP antagonized the antibiotics that were synergistic in S. aureus\u2014including AZI\u2014whereas synergy was observed with KAN (Fig. 2E; Fig. S1). These findings suggest that, in P. aeruginosa, PP may interfere with antibiotic uptake or entry.\n\n## DISCUSSION\nDespite its long-standing use as an anthelmintic, PP has received limited attention as an antimicrobial agent. Only a handful of studies have explored its activity against bacterial pathogens, primarily focusing on gram-positive species such as S. aureus or M. tuberculosis (17\u201319, 25, 26) or the intracellular pathogen Bartonella henselae (27). This scarcity of data underscores the need for further investigation into its antibacterial potential and mechanisms of action across a broader spectrum of pathogens.\nOur findings extend the known antimicrobial profile of PP, suggesting a degree of selectivity toward Actinomycetales, especially Corynebacterium spp., followed by Bacillales, while members of the Lactobacillales group and gram-negative bacteria remain resistant. The sensitive bacteria displayed MIC values below the range of PP concentration accepted for oral administration (\u224811 mg/kg up to 1 g per dose/day for 2 weeks) and within the range of intraperitoneal dosages (0.1\u20131 mg/kg daily) currently under investigation for cancer treatments (11, 28).\nIntrigued by the lack of activity against gram-negative bacteria, we assessed whether PP could traverse the outer membrane. Using its inherent fluorescence, we examined uptake in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S. aureus. PP was unable to enter PAO1 but successfully entered S. aureus, indicating that the outer membrane functions as a permeability barrier, as described for many antibiotics (20, 29). When outer membrane perturbing agents were added, gram-negative bacteria became sensitized to PP, especially PAO1. However, unlike the bactericidal effect seen in S. aureus, the effect was bacteriostatic.\nPentamidine and polymyxin, which interact with negatively charged lipopolysaccharides in the gram-negative outer membrane by displacing divalent cations such as Mg\u00b2+ and Ca\u00b2+, compromise membrane integrity and increase permeability, thus improving antimicrobial uptake (21, 22). Although previous studies show these agents sensitize bacteria to various antibiotics (22, 30), their synergy with PP was not universal; it was both strain- and drug-dependent. In contrast, the peptide D11 sensitized all tested bacteria to PP, as previously described for other pathogens and antibiotics (20). The pronounced efficacy of PP against gram-positive bacteria likely stems from differences in cell envelope architecture. Gram-negative outer membranes limit intracellular accumulation of PP, while their absence in gram-positive bacteria may facilitate greater uptake and retention. This has been observed for other hydrophobic drugs with limited gram-negative activity, including rifamycins and lipophilic cationic peptides (29, 31). Our experiments with membrane-permeabilizing agents confirmed that disrupting the outer membrane significantly increases PP susceptibility in gram-negative strains. This highlights the potential for PP in combination therapies with agents that disrupt membrane integrity or inhibit efflux systems. Similar synergistic effects have been noted with polymyxins combined with intracellular-targeting antimicrobials (32).\nMonitoring PP uptake in PAO1 in the presence of D11 over time revealed a gradual intracellular increase, reaching about 20% fluorescence after 2 h, compared to faster uptake in S. aureus. Interestingly, resistant gram-positive strains like E. faecalis showed high uptake (~60%) without affecting viability, suggesting alternative resistance mechanisms may counteract PP\u2019s activity in E. faecalis, whereas in PAO1, more critical targets could be reached. PP has recently been described as a G-quadruplex ligand drug. Therefore, the target\u2019s genomic location and the essentiality of the gene(s) involved could influence activity (11). Additionally, efflux pumps play a crucial role in resistance by expelling drugs from bacterial cells (33). To explore their role in PP resistance, we tested two efflux pump inhibitors: CCCP and PA\u03b2N. CCCP disrupts the proton motive force (PMF) across the membrane, affecting both \u0394\u03c8 and \u0394pH components (34, 35), which are essential for efflux pump function (36). PA\u03b2N, in contrast, directly binds to efflux pumps, blocking their activity and increasing intracellular drug concentration (37). While neither inhibitor affected PAO1 or E. faecalis, in S. aureus, the MIC for PP decreased with PA\u03b2N and increased with CCCP. This suggests that PA\u03b2N-inhibited pumps may mediate PP resistance in S. aureus, and that membrane potential is required for PP activity.\nThough PA\u03b2N is best known for inhibiting RND efflux pumps in gram-negative bacteria (38), which are scarcely reported in S. aureus (39\u201341), similar effects have been observed with combinations of PA\u03b2N and bile salts, enhancing drug activity where reserpine did not (42). PA\u03b2N also increased the efficacy of benzalkonium and flavonol derivatives in S. aureus (43, 44). S. aureus primarily relies on MFS, SMR, MATE, and ABC transporters (41), none of which are robustly inhibited by PA\u03b2N as in gram-negatives, but off-target or indirect effects cannot be excluded.\nFinally, we explored PP\u2019s potential synergy with a range of antibiotics. While combinations with PP in PAO1 were mostly antagonistic, KAN displayed a synergistic effect. In S. aureus, a significant reduction in the MIC was observed with CIP, TET, and DOX, while KAN was antagonistic. Synergistic effects with quinolones (CIP) were previously reported for S. aureus (18, 25). However, the observed antagonism with gram-negative strains and synergy with tetracyclines in S. aureus of KAN in PAO1 are novel findings.\nFrom a translational perspective, the administration, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile of PP warrants brief comment. As the pamoate salt, PP exhibits negligible systemic absorption after oral dosing; in a classic volunteer study, 350 mg single doses yielded no detectable drug in blood or urine up to 4 days, and ~90% of the dose was recovered in feces (45, 46). Consequently, systemic distribution after oral administration is expected to be minimal. When systemic exposure is achieved (e.g., via alternative formulations, salts, or routes), PP behaves as a lipophilic cation with preferential mitochondrial localization, a property that may influence tissue distribution and off-target effects (7). Clinically, historical use as an anthelmintic indicates a generally favorable tolerability profile dominated by gastrointestinal effects and benign red discoloration of stools/vomit; however, formal characterization of safety and pharmacokinetics for systemic repurposing is ongoing in a Phase I oncology study (47). These features contextualize our MIC findings and support cautious interpretation of systemic antibacterial applications of PP while encouraging formulation and delivery strategies tailored to the intended site of action.\nIn conclusion, the growing crisis of AMR needs the development of novel therapeutic agents and innovative treatment strategies. Drug repurposing is an attractive approach to accelerate the discovery of new antimicrobial agents, circumventing many of the financial and regulatory difficulties associated with de novo drug development. Our study provides compelling evidence for PP\u2019s antibacterial potential, particularly against gram-positive pathogens. By further elucidating its mechanism of action and resistance determinants, PP could serve as a foundation for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies or combination regimens targeting multidrug-resistant bacteria. The appeal of PP for antimicrobial drug repurposing is further supported by its advantageous drug profile, including extensive clinical experience with a relatively favorable safety record and well-defined pharmacological properties. As new antimicrobials are critically needed to address the growing threat of multidrug-resistant pathogens, exploring established drugs like PP provides a timely and cost-effective avenue for discovering novel antibacterial therapeutics. By elucidating its precise molecular targets and optimizing its formulation or delivery, PP could become a valuable addition to the declining arsenal of antimicrobial agents.\n\n## Bacterial strains and reagents\nPP was tested against a range of pathogenic bacteria, both gram-negative and gram-positive from clinical collection as well as clinically isolated (Table 2).\nBacterial strains were cultivated in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth (Thermo Scientific), supplemented with 5% lysed horse blood when required, at 37\u00b0C with continuous aeration. For solid media preparations, 1.5% agarose was added as needed (MHA). PP was purchased from TargetMol, while CCCP and FCCP were obtained from Thermo Scientific. Phe-Arg \u03b2-naphthylamide dihydrochloride (PA\u03b2N), reserpine, verapamil, and all tested antibiotics were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n## MIC, MBC, time-killing test, and combined test\nMIC was determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline (48). Briefly, twofold serial dilutions of the antimicrobials were prepared in cation-adjusted MHB in a 96-well plate. The plate was then inoculated with a bacterial suspension standardized to a 0.5 McFarland turbidity (approximately 1.5 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL) and diluted to a final concentration of 5 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL. When required, 5% lysed horse blood was added. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, and the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the antibiotic that completely inhibited visible bacterial growth. For the MBC assay, after performing the MIC test, 10 \u00b5L of culture medium was removed from wells with no visible growth and plated on MHA. In the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MBC was determined following a MIC test for PP conducted in the presence of 4 \u00b5M of the D-11 outer membrane-disrupting peptide. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration at which no visible growth was observed on the agar plate. For the PP MIC determination in the presence of CCCP, FCCP, PA\u03b2N, verapamil, reserpine, and D11, the MIC for these drugs was initially determined, and after that, an MIC for PP was performed in the presence of 0.25\u00d7 their MIC. Time-kill assays were performed to determine the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of PP. S. aureus culture was adjusted to approximately 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL in MHB and exposed to PP at 0.5\u00d7 MIC, 1\u00d7 MIC, and 2\u00d7 MIC concentrations. Aliquots were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 24 h, serially diluted 10-fold, and plated onto MHB agar to quantify viable bacteria. Bactericidal activity was defined as a \u22653 log10 reduction in CFU/mL relative to the initial inoculum.\nIn the case of the antibiotics, the MIC for them was determined for Staphylococcus aureus in the presence and absence of 0.5\u00d7, 0.25\u00d7, 0.125\u00d7, and 0.0625\u00d7 MIC of PP (1.25, 0.625, 0.312, and 0.156 \u00b5M), while for PAO1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 \u00b5M of PP was added due to its inherent resistance. In the case of azithromycin, bismuth subcitrate (TCI Europa) at 8 \u00b5M was added to sensitize PAO1 to this antimicrobial. The Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI) was calculated as FICI = FICA + FICB, where FICA = MICA (MIC antibiotic in combination)/MICA (MIC antibiotic alone) and FICB = MICB(MIC PP in combination)/MICB (MIC PP alone). Interpretation followed European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing criteria: synergistic, FICI \u2264 0.5; additive, 0.5 < FICI \u2264 1; indifferent, 1 < FICI \u2264 2; and antagonistic, and FICI > 2. When the MIC of an agent was not reached within the tested concentration range, a value equal to two times the highest concentration tested was used for the calculation.\n\n## Outer membrane permeabilization test\nTo investigate the role of the outer membrane in PP uptake, we determined the MIC of PP in the presence of four outer membrane-disrupting agents: EDTA, pentamidine, polymyxin B, and the peptide D-11. Initially, the MIC for each agent was established individually. Subsequently, PP\u2019s MIC was determined in the presence of sub-MIC concentrations of these compounds against seven different gram-negative bacterial strains. The concentrations used for the combinatorial tests are listed in Table S2.\n\n## Evaluation of PP uptake and PP efflux by flow cytometry\nTaking advantage of the fluorescent properties of PP, we evaluated its uptake in S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa. To prepare the cells, a fresh MHB culture was centrifuged, washed in G-HEPES buffer (HEPES supplemented with 5 mM glucose, pH 7.4), and adjusted to a cell concentration of 0.5 McFarland turbidity (about 1.5 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL) in the same buffer. For SA and EF, the prepared cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M PP for 15 min, after which they were analyzed using a FACSymphony A3 (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer with excitation and emission set at 561 and 586 nm, respectively. For PAO1, the uptake was assessed in the presence and absence of the D-11 peptide (4 \u00b5M) following 60 and 120 min of PP exposure.\nTo evaluate PP efflux, SA and EF cells (adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland standard) were incubated with 1 \u00b5M PP in G-HEPES buffer for 15 min. The cells were then washed three times (to remove PP) and resuspended in the same buffer, and fluorescence was recorded by flow cytometry every 15 min for 1 h. An analogous assay was performed for SA in the presence of PA\u03b2N, CCCP, or a combination of both. For PA\u03b2N, the cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M PP in the presence or absence of 16 \u00b5g/mL PA\u03b2N, and fluorescence accumulation was evaluated after 15 min. For CCCP, the cells were treated with 5 \u00b5M PP in the presence or absence of 0.25 \u00b5g/mL CCCP, and fluorescence was similarly monitored. All flow cytometry data were analyzed using the free software Floreada.io (https://floreada.io/).\n\n## Statistical analysis and reproducibility\nAll experiments were conducted in replicates as described, and the data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 software. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were performed using an unpaired Student\u2019s t-test where appropriate.",
