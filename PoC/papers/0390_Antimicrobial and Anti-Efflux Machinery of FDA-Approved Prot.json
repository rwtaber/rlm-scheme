Introduction\nEnterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), are among the prime pathogens on the high-priority pathogenic list published by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2017 [1,2]. These pathogens pose a high risk due to their ability to spread widely in the host, causing life-threatening opportunistic and nosocomial infections. They are part of the ESKAPE list (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) as they evade the activity of various antibiotics, leading to a global health crisis [3]. These pathogens also rapidly evolve into multidrug-resistant strains, resulting in prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality rates [4].\nThese pathogens possess diverse resistance mechanisms, either acquired or innate, such as drug-target mutations, enzymatic-based drug inactivation, and a decrease in the intracellular effective drug concentration, either by decreasing drug entry or increasing its efflux to the cell surroundings [5]. The efflux pump is a proteinaceous structure that is considered a cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) on its own. It has a broad substrate profile that can expel multiple antibiotics from similar or different classes due to their structural similarities. Alongside this, it can augment bacterial resistance levels through synergistic interactions with other resistance mechanisms [6], thereby prolonging microbial survival in challenging environmental conditions [7].\nUntil now, two categories of efflux system have been identified, comprising six major classes. The primary category derives its energy from ATP hydrolysis such as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC). The secondary category acts through proton exchange or ion-dependent gradients and includes five extrusion pumps: resistance\u2013nodulation\u2013cell division (RND), small multidrug resistance (SMR), major facilitator superfamily (MFS), multidrug and toxins extrusion (MATE), and the proteo-bacterial antimicrobial complex efflux family (PACE) [8]. The tripartite RND transporter is the well-recognized efflux type, found only in Gram-negative bacteria, such as AcrAB-TolC in most Enterobacteriaceae strains [9,10] and its homologue, the MexAB-OprM pump in P. aeruginosa [11], both contributing to resistance to almost every antimicrobial class.\nSince the majority of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes are located on plasmids and other genetically transferable elements, this makes K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa act as \u201ckey sellers\u201d for the development and sharing of these resistant traits with other species [12]. Therefore, targeting the efflux system is a critical therapeutic strategy to combat the spread of AMR in these two notorious pathogens.\nNumerous efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) such as carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) [13], berberine [14], quercetin [15], and the synthetic ML-7 compound [16] have been evaluated against MDR K. pneumoniae. Also in P. aeruginosa, potent EPIs have been tested, including epigallocatechin-3-gallate [17], glycyrrhizin [18], ethyl 4-bromopyrrole-2-carboxylate (RP1) [19], and an indole formamide TXA01182 compound [20], in addition its conformational analogue TXA09155, which enhanced the effectiveness of several antimicrobials in wild-type P. aeruginosa and clinical isolates as well [21]. Some of these inhibitors had a limited effect, while others had a remarkable activity upon coupling with antimicrobial agents.\nTo effectively block bacterial pumping-out mechanisms, EPIs should possess a broad spectrum of activity against multiple pumps, high bioavailability, minimal toxicity, and no induction of AMR [22]. Unfortunately, due to the lack of the aforementioned properties, unstudied pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, the lower activity of EPI when combined with a specific antibiotic, and the time required to discover a suitable new and qualified EPI, no EPI has progressed to clinical research trials [23].\nRecently, many Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications have been screened for possible NorA EPI activities in S. aureus, like small molecular compounds that potentiate fluoroquinolone resistance [24] in addition to diclofenac sodium and domperidone [25]. Furthermore, phentolamine, used primarily to treat severe hypertensive states, was discovered to boost the macrolide activity towards MDR Gram-negative-associated infections [26].\nMedications that have been approved for marketing by the FDA are known for their notable pharmacological safety and in vivo therapeutic efficacy, making them safe for administration. However, few studies have addressed the influence of proton pump inhibitors on targeting the bacterial efflux in Gram-negative bacteria. Also, the efflux-impeding activity of vitamins D and K3 was studied on Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans [27] and S. aureus [28], respectively.\nTherefore, this research was performed to study some FDA-approved proton pump inhibitors (esomeprazole (ESO), omeprazole (OME) and pantoprazole (PAN)) and vitamins (vitamin D and vitamin K) for efflux pump inhibitory effects in two medically important organisms, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa.\n\n## 2.1. PCR Confirmation for Efflux Pump Genes\nPCR analysis of genes responsible for efflux-encoding activity revealed that K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 harboured its representative gene, acrB, at 64 bp (Figure 1a). Also, the mexA gene was carried by PAO1 with amplicon sizes of 144 bp (Figure 1b).\n\n## 2.2. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations of the Tested Compounds Against the Gram-Negative Standard Strains\nThe MICs of the three PPIs (ESO, OME, and PAN) and two vitamins (VD and VK), in addition to a reference efflux substrate (EB) and inhibitor (CCCP) against two Gram-negative standard strains of K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and P. aeruginosa PAO1, were determined by microbroth dilution method and are given in Table 1.\nThe MIC values of EB were 2 \u03bcg/mL and 32 \u03bcg/mL for K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and P. aeruginosa PAO1, respectively, whereas CCCP MIC was 16,000 \u03bcg/mL for both strains. As can be observed in Table 1, the three PPIs exhibited the same MIC value (16,000 \u00b5g/mL) against the tested strains, except that ESO and PAN in PAO1 was 32,000 \u00b5g/mL.\nFor vitamins, the MIC of VD was 625 \u00b5g/mL for K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and 1250 \u00b5g/mL for PAO1, while the MIC of VK in K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 was 2500 \u00b5g/mL, which was less than that assigned to PAO1 (MIC = 5000 \u00b5g/mL) by half. Sub-MIC values (0.5\u00d7 and 0.25\u00d7 MIC) of PPIs and vitamins were displayed as well (Table 1).\n\n## 2.3.1. EB Accumulation Assay\nK. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 were tested to characterize their efflux properties and detect the EPI activities of the tested drugs.\nThe initial step in this technique is to establish the ideal conditions for accumulation of EB inside the bacterial cells followed by selecting the appropriate equilibrium EB concentration above which there is detectable accumulation within the cells. Accumulation of different EB concentrations was evaluated in the absence and presence of glucose, and one-way ANOVA test was performed to determine whether there was a statistical difference between both treatment conditions.\nIn K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503, the maximum concentration of EB that can be extruded by this organism in either the absence (Figure 2a) or presence (Figure 2b) of glucose is 1 \u00b5g/mL, since more EB accumulation will occur above this concentration. There were no significant differences in the amounts of EB accumulated by the K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 strain with no glucose and cells exposed to glucose throughout the EB concentration range except for 8 and 16 \u00b5g/mL, as the % accumulation was 250% vs. 185% and 204% vs. 168%, respectively (p \u02c2 0.0001, Figure 2c).\nAs shown in Figure 3a,b, the lowest concentration that resulted in equilibrium between the influx and efflux of EB substrate in P. aeruginosa PAO1, in the absence or presence of glucose, was 16 \u00b5g/mL. When compared with glucose-treated PAO1, the accumulation percentage of EB at 2 \u00b5g/mL (35%), 4 \u00b5g/mL (35%), 8 \u00b5g/mL (50%), and 16 \u00b5g/mL (51%) significantly increased by 64%, 60%, 106%, and 117%, respectively, in cells without glucose (p \u02c2 0.0001, Figure 3c).\n\n## 2.3.2. Evaluation of EPI Activities of the Tested PPIs and Vitamins\nThe ability of the two reference strains to efflux EB was assessed in the presence of FDA-approved PPIs and vitamins using a known EPI (CCCP) as a proof of concept, and the EB efflux was represented in terms of relative final fluorescence (RFF). Each strain was tested, in triplicate, at its equilibrium EB concentration and in the absence and presence of 0.5\u00d7 MIC of each drug (Table 1). All assays were performed in the presence of 0.4% glucose.\nThe accumulation of EB (1 \u00b5g/mL) in K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 cells after the addition of either CCCP or any PPI agent within 10 min (ESO (Figure 4a), OME (Figure 4b), and PAN (Figure 4c)) was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than in the untreated strain. Unlike PAN, ESO and OME displayed RFF values of 0.58 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.29 \u00b1 0.13, respectively, against the K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 strain, indicating their ability for higher levels of EB accumulation than CCCP (RFF = 0.18 \u00b1 0.09, Table 2).\nThe fluorescence value of K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 cells in the presence of VD (Figure 5a) and VK (Figure 5b) was slightly more than the control strain; however, the efflux activity of both vitamins was less (lower RFF values) than that of CCCP (RFF was 0.092 \u00b1 0.04 for VD and 0.06 \u00b1 0.04 for VK versus 0.18 \u00b1 0.09 for CCCP, p < 0.0001) (Table 2).\nAll three PPIs, at the sub-inhibitory concentration, demonstrated a substantial increase in EB accumulation by P. aeruginosa PAO1 (16 \u00b5g/mL) (Figure 6), even higher than the positive control, CCCP. The fold change in EB accumulation of ESO was slightly higher than that of CCCP (RFF = 21.03 \u00b1 2.2 vs. 15.6 \u00b1 1.8) and OME (RFF = 19.7 \u00b1 1.3), and it was significantly higher (2-fold increase) for PAN (RFF = 29.9 \u00b1 2.8, p = 0.001) (Table 3).\nSimilarly, challenged PAO1 (after 10 min incubation) with either vitamin, VD (Figure 7a) or VK (Figure 7b), resulted in significant increase in EB detainment compared with the control PAO1, p < 0.0001. Compared with the RFF of CCCP (15.6 \u00b1 1.8), a very similar RFF value for VK (15.1 \u00b1 1.3), but a low RFF value for VD (10.8 \u00b1 1.4), were shown (Table 3).\n\n## 2.4. The MIC of Ciprofloxacin Alone and in Combination with the Tested Compounds\nThe MIC of ciprofloxacin against both K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 was 62.5 \u00b5g/mL (Table 4). The presence of 0.5\u00d7 MICs of either VD or VK with ciprofloxacin significantly reduced the MIC of ciprofloxacin in both P. aeruginosa PAO1 to 0.98\u20131.95 \u00b5g/mL and K. pneumonia ATCC 51503 to 3.9\u20137.8 \u00b5g/mL (Table 4).\nFurthermore, the combination of ciprofloxacin with PPEs showed a significant decrease in the MIC of ciprofloxacin, to 0.98 \u00b5g/mL, with P. aeruginosa PAO1 isolate and to 0.98\u201315.6 \u00b5g/mL ciprofloxacin/PPE combinations with K. pneumonia ATCC 51503 (Table 4).\n\n## 2.5. RT-PCR Assessment for Efflux Gene Quantification\nThe expression level of acrB and mexA efflux genes in challenged K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 with 0.5\u00d7 MICs of each tested PPI, respectively, was quantified and further normalized relative to the expression levels of the standard specialized housekeeping genes, ropD in the same strain, in accordance with the 2\u2212\u2206\u2206CT analysis method.\nThe data revealed remarkable downregulation of acrB expression in K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 treated with 0.5\u00d7 MIC of OME (91.5% reduction, p \u02c2 0.0001), more than that challenged with 0.5\u00d7 MICs of ESO and PAN (each 86% reduction, p \u02c2 0.0001), compared with the untreated ATCC 51503 strain (Figure 8a). As illustrated in Figure 8b, P. aeruginosa PAO1 treated with 0.5\u00d7 MIC of ESO, OME, and PAN showed brilliant down-expression in the mexA level by 95%, 99.7%, and 99.4%, respectively, compared with the PPI-free PAO1 strain (p \u02c2 0.0001).\n\n## 2.6. Docking Analysis\nThe structures of AcrB and MexA proteins were subjected to molecular docking modelling to assess the potential mode of binding of the cocrystal ligand and the drugs omeprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole, vitamin D, and vitamin K. As anticipated, the docking score showed that every drug fits well into the active site region (Supplementary Table S1). The docking scores show that the five drugs\u2019 binding was almost identical, varying between hydrogen bonding and solely hydrophobic interactions (Figure 9 and Figure 10). Remarkably, vitamin D has the greatest docking score in both the AcrB and MexA receptors (Figure 9 and Figure 10).\n\n## 3. Discussion\nAmong Gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are primarily opportunistic pathogens, causing a wide array of infections, and they can be zoonotic from animals and broiler chickens [29], nosocomial in hospitalized and immunocompromised individuals [30], and can cause community-obtained infections linked to the use of either spoiled food or impure water [31,32]. While in clinical settings, extensive work has been conducted on the risk associated with these organisms, they pose a significant threat to world health due to their success in the growing number of MDR phenotypes discovered each year that defy the currently available therapeutics [19].\nThe rise of MDR infections is partly attributed to the co-regulation of membrane impermeability and active drug efflux, which is believed to be a principal cause of both inherent and acquired drug resistance [8,33]. The e system is one of the serious determinants that most bacteria are armed with. Efflux pumps are membrane transporter proteins involved not only in pumping bacterial metabolites and harmful substances out to the external environment, but also in circumventing the action of several antimicrobial classes [34]. Extruding an antibiotic from the cells results in lowering its intracellular concentration, impairing its reaching its intended therapeutic target and causing treatment failure in addition to the great development of MDR phenomena [6,35,36].\nThe RND efflux pump is a major superfamily that has contributed to the overwhelming AMR with high priority in Gram-negative pathogens [37,38]. The main relevant efflux systems in K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are AcrAB-TolC [39] and MexAB-OprM [40,41], respectively. Attenuation of efflux activity by EP-inhibiting agents is desirable since this will weaken the bacterial biofilm and virulence and successfully reconquer a vast swath of existing ineffective treatment options [42].\nAlthough in recent research many EPIs have been identified, none of them can progress into clinical trials. Therefore, our research focused on studying the efficacy of already FDA-approved medications and supplements on the efflux system, hoping to repurpose their use as EPIs. According to the genotypic status, two standard strains of K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 that were positive for acrB and mexA efflux genes, respectively (Figure 1), were utilized in this research.\nThree clinically common proton uncouplers (ESO, OME, and PAN) and two vitamins (VD and VK) were examined for their MICs against the selected two standard strains using microtitre plate-based crystal violet assay [43]. Generally, the tested strains showed the same MICs for ESO, OME, and PAN, apart from MICESO and MICPAN in PAO1 (Table 1). Overall, the antimicrobial activities of the three PPIs were at concentrations greater than their clinically desirable or achievable therapeutic doses. Administration of PPIs is associated with subsequent bacterial overgrowth, because they block gastric acidity secretions, which is necessary to hamper the reach of the infectious microbe to the gastrointestinal tract [44,45]. So, their inferior antibacterial performance (elevated MIC values) may be due to the development increase in bacterial non-susceptibility towards the PPIs. However, the slight antimicrobial effect of PPIs was likely attributed to their ability to inhibit the urease enzyme, which plays a vital role in bacterial colonization within the intestinal parietal cells, as well as their structural resemblance to some imidazole-based antibiotics (i.e., metronidazole and tinidazole) that work against bacteria [46]. Furthermore, the chelating capacity of PAN to Zn+ [2] ions could explain its inhibitory mechanism against metallo-\u03b2-lactamase producers [47]. Omeprazole, in a combination therapy, was more effective at killing MDR H. pylori in vivo and in vitro [48,49]. Some previous studies demonstrated the antibacterial activity of PPIs against P. aeruginosa [50], M. tuberculosis [51], and S. aureus [52], but further research is required to characterize the exact ability of PPIs by which they inhibit the bacterial growth in vitro.\nVitamins D and K showed more antimicrobial efficacy than PPIs, showing MIC ranges of 625 to 5000 (Table 1). Earlier studies have elucidated significant antibacterial effects of vitamins D and K, either alone or as a combination therapy, to fight resistant strains [53,54,55]. Vitamin D is an immune stimulator that improves the permeability of cell membranes and activates two small cationic peptide families, cathelicidin and defensin, that have broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against a wide pathogenic range [56]. The bacteriostatic effect of VD on a wide variety of pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in addition to C. albicans was estimated [57,58]. Vitamin K has a great ability to alter the biological selective permeability function of the cell plasma membrane, so it limited the bacterial growth, and this signifies its antimicrobial and anti-efflux activity as well [28,59]. Vitamin K shows an antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, B. anthracis, H. pylori [60], and P. aeruginosa 03, exhibiting an MIC of 64 \u00b5g/mL, so potentiating the antimicrobial activity of aminoglycosides [59]. Not only do VD and VK have an anti-infective effect [61,62], but also vitamins B2 [63], C [64], P, and E [65].\nWe should take in account the side effects of PPIs, such as bone fractures, nutritional deficiencies, vertigo, backache, skin rash, and respiratory and gastrointestinal associated disorders [54,66]. The American Association of Poison Control Centers receives a startling 50,000 reports of vitamin toxicity each year. Other than hypervitaminosis-related signs such as tiredness, light-headedness, headaches, and digestive issues [67], the consequences are more pronounced for overdosing of VD due to soft-tissue calcification and brain, heart, and kidney damage [68] as well as of VK due to anaemia and haemorrhagic illness [22,69].\nThe efflux efficiency of the formerly chosen strains was supported by the fluorescent method, providing insights into the efflux of a substrate by the selected drug transporter-expressed strains and their sensibility towards the tested EPIs. Although EB emits trivial fluorescence, powerful strong fluorescence will emit when it enters and intercalates with the bacterial cell DNA. So, EB was selected as a broad range substrate for efflux investigation [70]. Based on MICs, all accumulation experiments were carried out with EB concentrations that did not exceed 0.5\u00d7 MIC (Table 1) in order not to affect the cell viability, reproduction, or metabolic activity in any way.\nFirstly, the steady-state EB concentration specific for each tested standard strain, K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and P. aeruginosa PAO1, was detected. This equilibrium concentration represented the balance between passive diffusion-associated EB entry and its extrusion by efflux pump systems. According to kinetic behaviour, activation of the bacterial efflux system begins to balance the passive diffusion-mediated EB influx. The amount of EB is extruded from the cytoplasm when it enters at low concentration that is not enough for irreversible binding with the cytoplasmic component. When the EB concentration surpasses its extrusion, it is embedded in nucleic acid within the cells, after which its extrusion is impossible [71]. Due to the overexpression of the efflux system in K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 strain (AcrAB-TolC), it accumulated the least EB (1 \u03bcg/mL, Figure 2), even when it was exposed to the maximum 16 \u03bcg/mL of EB concentration. On the contrary, PAO1, whose MexAB-OprM efflux system has been inactivated, accumulated approximately 16 times more EB even when it was exposed to a far lower EB concentration (0.5 \u03bcg/mL, Figure 3).\nWe next demonstrated the activity of PPIs and vitamins on real-time EB accumulation in the previously chosen standard strains. All the employed drugs were tested at concentrations that do not inhibit the standard strains\u2019 growth (sub-MICs) to ensure that any increase in EB fluorescence was not due to their antibacterial activity. In general, and as shown in Figure 2c and Figure 3c, the amount of EB accumulated by ATCC 51503 and PAO1, respectively, unexposed to glucose was higher than that treated with glucose (p \u02c2 0.0001), indicating that glucose reenergizes the bacterial cells and maximizes active efflux. So, evaluating the EPI activities of the tested FDA-approved drugs and supplements (i.e., enhancement of EB accumulation) was performed under conditions that promoted the efflux machinery (presence of glucose and 40 \u00b0C incubation temperature). The potential efflux-inhibiting activity of the tested compounds was expressed through the calculated RFF, and the results were compared with values obtained for the reference CCCP control.\nUpon addition of the tested PPIs and vitamins, the fluorescence level was increased, indicating an enhanced EB accumulation by the two reference strains compared with untreated standard cells, which was believed to be an important indicator for the speculated activity of the tested drugs [38]. The accumulation assays performed in the presence of the three PPIs showed that PAN was the most effective in retaining the efflux dye, more than the well-known CCCP in PAO1 (Figure 6c, Table 3) followed by ESO (Figure 6a, Table 3). On the other hand, in K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503, ESO (Figure 4a) accumulated the artificial EB substrate significantly more than OME, PAN, and even CCCP (Table 2).\nThe presence of 1/2 MICs of either VD or VK with ciprofloxacin significantly reduced the MIC of ciprofloxacin in both P. aeruginosa PAO1 and K. pneumonia ATCC 51503 by 64-fold. Furthermore, the combination of ciprofloxacin with PPEs showed a significant decrease in the MIC of ciprofloxacin, with a more than 32-fold decrease in the MIC of P. aeruginosa PAO1 isolate and a 4- to 32-fold decrease in MICs in ciprofloxacin/PPE combinations in K. pneumonia ATCC 51503.\nThere are different anti-efflux strategies, including (i) inhibition of substrate ejection either by competitive inhibition or by promoting some conformational changes, (ii) impairment of the outer membrane efflux component, and (iii) interruption of the functional assembly of the tripartite efflux protein structure [72]. The PPIs structure involves a substituted benzimidazole ring that irreversibly binds to and prevents the hydrogen\u2013potassium ATPase enzyme, so affecting the bacterial drug uptake. Additionally, protonation of benzimidazoles in bacterial cytoplasm resulted in production of a reactive thiol group that binds with the efflux channel. Also, because of their proton blockage ability, they can inhibit the bacterial efflux using the proton (H+) gradient (drug/proton anti-porters) to extrude antibiotics to the cytosol. Hence, PPIs were considered potential EPIs by depleting the energy source required to eject the efflux substrate [3,73]. Our results agreed with the findings of Lake [74], who evaluated the anti-efflux activity of OME and PAN on rifampicin in M. tuberculosis. In line with previous reports, the anti-efflux efficiency of PAN was also inspected through reducing fluconazole resistance in C. albicans [75] or in all Candida spp. [76]. In congruence with many studies, the EP inhibition of OME was detected through fighting the microbial resistance and restoring the bactericidal activity of norfloxacin in S. aureus [52], attenuating H. pylori infection upon combination with the anti-emetic domperidone [77], increasing the antibiotic susceptibility in MDR E. coli by 2- to 8-fold, and the failure of EB to come out from more than 70% of bacterial isolates by the cartwheel method [78], in addition to decreasing the imipenem MIC up to 6-fold in A. baumannii [3]. In regard to virtual docking, OME was able to bind at a large hydrophobic bond, showing significant interactions with the MDR efflux system, NorA, in S. aureus [79]. Moreover, PPIs not only function as antacids, but they also block efflux pumps and enhance the effects of antibiotics by boosting their intracellular accumulation.\nThe fluorescence emission of cells incubated with glucose plus VD or VK showed a significantly higher degree of EB accumulated than that of cells incubated with glucose only, indicating inhibition of the efflux pump. Both VD and VK showed tremendous strengths of EB accumulation, particularly in PAO1 (Table 3 and Figure 7), but still less than the CCCP pump inhibitor. It was demonstrated that the association with VK significantly reduced the MIC of EB compared with EB alone, which was indicative of its efflux inhibition [28]. Both VD and VK are fat-soluble vitamins that induce morphophysiological changes in the cell membranes, resulting in loss of membrane potential or ions and, consequently, collapse of the proton pump with the depletion of ATP support. Additionally, VK, unlike other vitamins, fights the AMR by enhancing the cytoplasmic membrane stability and improving its permeability for antibacterial molecules in addition to hindering the bacterial efflux from pumping the antimicrobials out of the cells [28,59].\nIt is noteworthy that the effective EPI concentration of CCCP was 8000 \u00b5g/mL, those of the PPIs were 8000 and 16000 \u00b5g/mL, those of VD were 312.5 and 625 \u00b5g/mL, and those of VK were 1250 and 2500 \u00b5g/mL (Table 1). Therefore, VD and VK (which achieved the highest EPI activity with lower concentrations) were more potent than CCCP and the PPIs (which achieved their EPI activity with higher concentrations).\nOn the other hand, unlike CCCP, which has exhibited a toxicity problem by disrupting the mitochondrial proton-motive force in eukaryotes [80], the tested PPIs and vitamins are safer because they are extremely well tolerated and are consumed, all over the world, as OTC medications with very few adverse effects. Over and above that, screening and repurposing of FDA-approved PPIs and vitamins for having EPI action is a time-saving, inexpensive, and more auspicious approach than the strategy of de novo drug discovery that often has a high cost, unpredictable risk, and long development time.\nThe likelihood of bacterial resistance to EPIs must be taken into account due to mutations affecting the efflux system. EPIs were predicted to be substrates for bacterial pumps, so exposure to only the efflux inhibitor could be a way to put selective pressure on efflux inhibitor-resistant strains. As a consequence, the MIC of phenylalanyl-\u03b2-naphtylamide (PA\u03b2N) was increased by 6- to 12-fold in K. pneumoniae when combined with niclosamide due to a mutation in the acrR efflux gene [81].\nOn the other hand, using EPIs with significant antimicrobial effects is associated with serious bacterial resistance progression, so EPIs with no or little activity against the bacterial cell prolong the utilized drug\u2019s lifespan via decreasing the resistance development [22,82]. For instance, the 1,8-naphthyridine is an EPI with no antibacterial activity, so bacteria are less likely to develop resistance towards it [82]. It is still important to confirm whether EPIs primarily target the efflux pumps rather than other side mechanisms, as this could inhibit or, at least, delay the bacterial resistance progression. PA\u03b2N, a broad-spectrum EPI, can increase the MIC of levofloxacin in P. aeruginosa by 8-fold, while in P. aeruginosa, it overexpresses MexAB-OprM transporters by 64-fold [83]. NSC 60339 compound intensifies erythromycin and novobiocin activity in E. coli, but it has no effect on these antibiotics in pump-lacking E. coli [84]. Even so, numerous EPIs have the ability to enhance antibiotic activity via efflux-independent mechanisms, such as impairing rather than penetrating the bacterial membrane. These EPIs not only can augment the antibiotic influx, but also be sufficient to induce bacterial lysis [85], resulting in the possibility for resistance development and cytotoxicity in clinical practice. Hence, for less development of EPI-mediated resistance, exploration of EPIs with no off-target effects, that penetrate the bacterial membrane rather than disrupt it, is crucial.\nOwing to the inferior antibacterial efficacy of PPIs and their potency over the standard CCCP in the two selected reference strains, they were the most effective efflux inhibitors used. That is why qRT-PCR was performed, to deeply investigate the effect of ESO, OME, and PAN on bacterial efflux through quantifying the expression of the common efflux pump genes acrB and mexA in K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and P. aeruginosa PAO1, respectively. Although many studies have been carried out on the influence of many inhibitors on acrB and mexA efflux genes, unfortunately, no studies have evaluated the effect of PPIs on the function of these genes. Herein, the expression of the examined genes was significantly downregulated in PPI-treated strains compared with the untreated control. Although ESO, OME, and PAN were not less effective than each other, OME provoked a pronounced decrease in the expression level of acrB in K. pneumoniae ATCC 51503 and mexA in PAO1, by 91.5% (Figure 8a)",
