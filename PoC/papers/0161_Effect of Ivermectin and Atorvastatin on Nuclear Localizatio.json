  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nSince the early days of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, drug repurposing has aroused great interest in the development of novel antiviral therapies. This concept, also called rediscovering or therapeutic indication expansion, implies establishing new medical uses for already known drugs [1]. Different agents have been investigated for antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) including antimalarials, antiparasitics, antibiotics, antihypertensives, and hypoglycemics [2].\nMany drugs with potential effects in COVID-19 infection have also been previously explored as repurposed options for cancer treatment, and suggestive similarities were found to exist between antitumor and host-based antiviral mechanisms [3]. Clinically approved drugs could be used to target intracellular mechanisms in host cells that are essential for viral replication. In this regard, nuclear transport and vesicle trafficking are key cellular functions involved in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses and also during cancer development.\nIvermectin (IVM) is a well-known antihelmintic drug with reported antiviral activity against Dengue, Zika and Influenza virus [4]. Among the pleiotropic effects on virus-infected host cells, IVM is capable of interfering with importin \u03b1/\u03b2-mediated nuclear transport, thus inhibiting nuclear import mechanisms of viral proteins and reducing viral replication [5]. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Caly et al. communicated a potent activity of high concentrations of IVM (IC50 of about 2.5 \u00b5M) against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cell cultures [6]. However, a question remains whether these high concentrations can be effectively achieved clinically at safe doses. Recently, we reported the results of a proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial in hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving high oral doses of IVM (0.6 mg/kg/day) [7]. Although no differences between treated and control patients were observed in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, a concentration-dependent antiviral activity was noticed after five days of IVM treatment. A relationship was identified between high IVM plasma concentrations (>160 ng/mL) and significant increases of SARS-CoV-2 viral decay rates in respiratory secretions [7].\nBeyond the obvious importance of dosing schedules and tissue concentrations of IVM, it is also attractive to search for drug combinations that could potentiate its antiviral mechanism in host cells. Lipophilic statins used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia such as atorvastatin (ATV) are well-tolerated compounds with antitumor activity that are interesting host-based drug candidates for SARS-CoV-2 in combination with IVM [3]. It is known that statins reduce membrane localization of Rho GTPases, thus affecting intracellular signaling involved in the organization of actin cytoskeleton during the metastatic process [8]. Interestingly, the Rho GTPases Rho A and CDC42 are also responsible for actin-dependent host cell protein trafficking, playing important roles in the intracellular transport of viral proteins [9].\nIn the present work, we first analyzed susceptibility infection profiles in SARS-CoV-2-positive versus -negative patients in a case-control study (GSE152075), evaluating the expression of the respective host cell drug targets importins and Rho GTPases. We then modeled the infection in vitro using Poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA, assessing IVM and ATV effects on drug targets at the transcriptional level. Finally, we conducted a confocal microscopy study to analyze the in vitro effects of IVM on nuclear localization of importin \u03b1, alone and in combination with ATV, at potentially clinically-relevant concentrations.\n\n## 2.1. Analysis of Publicly Available RNA-Seq Datasets\nRNA-Seq data analysis from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients was performed as previously described [10]. We downloaded the GSE152075 dataset [11], which contains pseudoaligned pre-processed RNA-Seq data and clinico-pathological information from 430 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 54 negative patients.\nFor RNA-Seq analysis from in vitro and in vivo experiments, we used GSE147507 dataset [12], which contains RNA-Seq data from: (i) independent biological triplicates of transformed lung alveolar cells (A549) transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2 infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI: 2) or mock-phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); and (ii) tracheal samples from 4-month-old ferrets intranasally infected with 5 \u00d7 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 or mock-PBS.\nWe removed samples with >70% of total genes with 0 sequence reads, considering them as very low-quality samples that might introduce a bias. Normalization, batch effect correction, and differential expression were performed with R package DEseq2 v1.28.1 [13]. Age was categorized according to the WHO guidelines [14]: <30 years old, every 10 years between 30 and 70 years old, and \u226570 years old as described [15]. To stratify COVID-19 positive patients based on viral load at the time of diagnosis, we used the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of the N1 viral gene amplification as a surrogate variable for viral load (Ct > 24 = low; Ct = 24\u201319 = medium; Ct < 19 = high).\nMicroarray analysis from human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) treated or not with ATV (10 \u00b5M 24 h) were performed using differential expression data from the GSE8686 dataset [16].\n\n## 2.2. Drugs and Reagents\nIVM (MW 875 g/mol; PubChem ID 24278497) and ATV calcium trihydrate (MW 1209.4 g/mol; PubChem ID 656846) were obtained from Elea-Phoenix (Buenos Aires, Argentina), following the Good Manufacturing Practices standards (lot numbers 227974 and 223557, respectively). Compounds were first resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) generating concentrated stocks of 11.4 and 10 mM, respectively, and aliquoted at \u221220 \u00b0C. Final working concentrations were achieved after serial dilutions using PBS. Control groups were treated with PBS plus corresponding DMSO concentrations as the vehicle. Immunolabeling of cells was conducted using a primary anti-importin \u03b1 (KPNA2) antibody generated in rabbit at 1/250 dilution and a secondary polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG generated in goat conjugated with Alexa 594 at 1/200 dilution (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). High molecular weight Poly(I:C) was purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA, USA) and prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, endotoxin-free water was added to Poly(I:C) at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, incubated at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min, aliquoted, and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use.\n\n## 2.3. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions\nHuman cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa (ATCC\u00ae CCL-2\u2122), human lung carcinoma A549 (ATCC\u00ae CCL-185\u2122), and green monkey kidney epithelium Vero (ATCC\u00ae CCL-81\u2122) cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, Rockville, MD, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, and 80 \u03bcg/mL gentamycin in a monolayer culture, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were harvested using a trypsin/EDTA solution (Gibco) diluted in PBS and routinely tested for mycoplasma.\n\n## 2.4. Poly(I:C) Treatment\nPoly(I:C) intracellular administration was performed by transfection with Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions at a final concentration of Poly(I:C) of 10 \u00b5g/mL. Briefly, A549 cells were plated in 6-well flat bottom plates at a density of 2 \u00d7 105 cells in complete DMEM, allowed to attach overnight, and then transfected with Poly(I:C) or water as mock in DMEM without FBS and antibiotics. After 6 h, the media were replaced and cells were treated with IVM (2.5 \u00b5M) and ATV (10 \u00b5M) alone or in combination.\n\n## 2.5. RNA Isolation, c-DNA Synthesis, and Quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR)\nTotal RNA was isolated with Quick-Zol (Kalium technologies, Buenos Aires, Argentina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. cDNAs were synthesized with RevertAid Premium First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Waltham, MA, USA) and used for real-time PCR amplification with Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) in a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). PPIA was used as the internal reference gene. Data were analyzed using the method of 2-\u2206\u2206CT [17]. Table 1 describes the forward and reverse primer sequences designed specifically for each species to avoid cross-reactivity.\n\n## 2.6. Cell Viability Assay\nCytostatic effects of IVM on Hela and Vero cells were measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) [18]. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well flat bottom plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 103 cells per 200 \u00b5L in complete D-MEM, allowed to attach overnight, and then treated for 48 h with increasing concentrations of IVM (2.5, 5, and 25 \u00b5M). After adding 20 \u00b5L of MTT reagent to each well, plates were incubated for 2.5 h. Formazan crystals were solubilized using DMSO and the absorbance of each well was measured at 570 nm. The optical density of the vehicle-treated control cells was taken as 100% viability.\n\n## 2.7. Immunofluorescence Staining of Importin \u03b1\nBriefly, 2 \u00d7 104 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well flat bottom plates and cultured for 48 h in complete growth medium. After reaching \u224840% confluence, cells were exposed to different drug concentrations for 1\u201324 h and then fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. After permeabilizing and blocking with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 4% FBS in PBS, respectively, cells were incubated with a primary rabbit anti-Importin \u03b1 antibody for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Importin \u03b1-bound antibodies were detected with a secondary goat polyclonal Alexa 594-conjugated antibody for 40 min at room temperature and nuclei were labeled with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) [19]. Absence of immunofluorescence staining was confirmed when the primary antibody was omitted.\n\n## 2.8. Confocal Microscopy Studies and Acquisition Settings\nNuclear/cytoplasmic importin \u03b1 distribution in Hela and Vero cells was assessed using a TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). CLSM was equipped with a 405 nm diode and 561 nm helium-neon lasers and operated by the Leica Application Suite X program (LAS X V3.7.2, Leica Microsystems). Twelve-bit images with 1024 \u00d7 1024-pixel resolution were obtained by sequential scanning using a 63\u00d7 oil immersion objective. Pinhole and gain values were set at 1 and 600, respectively. LAS X software was used for the analysis of digitized CLSM images in order to calculate the nuclear/cytoplasmic fluorescence ratio (Fn/Fc), following the formula: Fn/Fc = (Fn \u2212 Fb)/(Fc \u2212 Fb), where Fb is the background autofluorescence [5,20,21]. Two independent trained operators used a semi-automated hand-drawn polygon contouring system to delineate specific ROIs for nuclear or cytoplasmic fluorescence quantification [22]. Single cell values were averaged for a minimum of 40 cells per experimental condition as a result of two or three independent experiments to correct for variations in expression levels [23,24].\n\n## 2.9. Statistics\nTo determine statistical differences between categorical groups in gene expression analysis, we performed two-tailed Welch\u2019s t tests when the assumption normality was maintained and Wilcoxon rank sum test when we could not assume normal distribution. Two-sided, increasing and decreasing Jonckheere\u2013Terpstra trend tests (with 500 permutations) were used to determine statistical trends between gene expression and age groups. To study pairwise correlations between continuous variables, the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient was calculated. We did not correct the p-value for multiple testing. All results were plotted using ggplot2 [25], ggpubr [26], and GGally [27] in R [28].\nFor confocal microscopy and cellular studies, in order to compare differences between two experimental groups, two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney or t-tests were used for non-parametric or normal distribution of data, respectively. In case of more than two experimental groups, ANOVA analysis with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons post-test was used. Kruskal\u2013Wallis analysis with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons post-test was used in the case of non-parametric distribution of data. Data were derived from at least two or three independent experiments, unless stated otherwise. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM), scattered dot blot with median \u00b1 quartiles, or violin plots.\nDifferences were considered statistically significant at a level of p < 0.05. Data processing and statistical analysis was performed using the Prism 6.1 Software (GraphPad Holdings, CA, USA).\n\n## 3.1. Expression of the Importin Family Genes in SARS-CoV-2-Positive and -Negative Patients\nWe used the publicly available RNA sequencing dataset GSE152075 to evaluate the expression of the importin family genes (Importin \u03b15 (KPNA1), Importin \u03b11 (KPNA2), Importin \u03b14 (KPNA3), Importin \u03b13 (KPNA4), Importin \u03b16 (KPNA5), Importin \u03b17 (KPNA6), Importin \u03b18 (KPNA7), and Importin \u03b21 (KPNB1)) in COVID-19 positive and negative patients (Figure 1A). This set contained transcriptomic data from nasopharyngeal swabs from 430 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 54 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. Patient demographics are available in Table S1.\nResults showed that COVID-19 patients had higher KPNA5 (Figure 1F.I) and lower KPNA7 (Figure 1H.I) expression compared with non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0025 and, p = 0.0017, respectively). Decrease in KPNA3 (p = 0.0526) and increase in KPNB1 (p = 0.054) expressions were found with marginal significance in COVID-19 patients (Figure 1D.I,I.I). No statistical differences for the other importin genes were observed between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (Figure 1A.I,B.I,C.I,E.I,G.I).\nSince age and sex have been reported as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we additionally assessed the association between the importins\u2019 gene expression and these risk factors. When assessing gene expression in patients categorized by age, we found that age increase was significantly associated with lower KPNA2, KPNA3, KPNA4, KPNA6, and KPNB1 expression (p-trend decreasing = 0.01; p-trend decreasing = 0.004; p-trend decreasing = 0.04, p-trend decreasing = 0.002; p-trend decreasing = 0.004 respectively) and higher KPNA7 expression in COVID-19 patients (p-trend increasing = 0.016), but not in non-COVID-19 patients (Figure 1B(I,II)). No statistical differences were found when comparing between male and female patients (Figure S1A). To further our analysis, we categorized patients based on their viral load at time of diagnosis. We used the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) of the N1 viral gene amplification as a surrogate variable for viral load (Figure S2). The analysis showed similar results to the unstratified analysis.\nResults were then validated in the GSE147507 dataset, which covers transcriptomic data from A549 cells infected or not with SARS-CoV-2 as well as data from trachea biopsies of 4-month-old ferrets harvested three days after SARS-CoV-2 infection or mock treatment (Figure S3A). When analyzing gene expression in A549 cells, results showed a decrease in KPNA2 (p = 0.0285) and an increase in KPNA5 (p = 0.0266) upon viral infection (Figure S3B). Additionally, ferret infection with SARS-CoV-2 showed an increase in KPNA1, KPNA4, and KPNA5 expression (p = 0.0473, p = 0.0449, and p = 0.0371, respectively) when compared with the mock treatment (Figure S3C). Interestingly, KPNA5 appears upregulated upon infection, across the different datasets.\n\n## 3.2. Expression of the Rho GTPase Family Genes in SARS-CoV-2-Positive and -Negative Patients\nSince viral infection relies on intra-cellular protein transport modulated by Rho GTPases, we sought to evaluate changes in the gene expression of these proteins upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Rho GTPase genes Ras Homolog Family Member A (RHOA), Rac Family Small GTPase 1 (RAC1) and Cell Division Cycle 42 (CDC42) were assessed.\nResults show that RHOA and CDC42 expression was significantly decreased (p = 0.0036, p = 0.0044, respectively) in COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 patients (Figure 2A.I,B.I). All three Rho GTPases, RHOA, CDC42, and RAC1, showed a significant decrease in gene expression upon age in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2A.II,B.II,C.II; p-trend decreasing = 0.002, p-trend decreasing = 0.008, p-trend decreasing = 0.004, respectively). No statistical differences were found when comparing between male and female patients (Figure S1B).\nRegarding the infection in A549 cells, no changes were observed when assessing gene expression of the Rho GTPase family compared with the controls (Figure S3B). The ferret infection dataset did not provide RNA-Seq reads for the Rho GTPases.\n\n## 3.3. Gene Correlation Analysis in SARS-CoV-2-Positive and -Negative Patients\nNext, pairwise Spearman correlation analyses were performed between genes that had significant or marginal significant changes in gene expression upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 in patients (Figure 2D). Patient age was also correlated with gene expression. For each combination of variables, analyses were performed for all patients, COVID-19 patients only and non-COVID-19 patients only (Figure 2E). Black boxes indicate combinations of variables where correlation was significant for COVID-19 patients, but not for non-COVID-19. Interestingly, RHOA with KPNA7 (r = 0.140, p < 0.01) and CDC42 with KPNA5 (r = 0.474, p < 0.001) showed positive correlations compared with no significant correlations in non-COVID-19 patients.\n\n## 3.4. Modulation of Importin and Rho GTPases Transcriptional Expression by IVM and ATV in a Viral Infection Simulation Context\nTo further our analysis, we used Poly(I:C), a synthetic dsRNA compound that binds Toll- like receptor 3 (TLR3), to mimic a viral infection. Poly(I:C) recapitulates many of the effects observed in viral dsRNA in vitro and in vivo [29]. In this model, we examined the effect of IVM and ATV on importin family and Rho GTPases gene expression in A549 cells. We selected the A549 cell line as the lung is the principal homing organ for SARS-CoV-2 [30]. Cells were treated with or without Poly(I:C) and then subjected to high IVM concentration (2.5 \u00b5M for 1 h) alone or in combination with ATV (10 \u00b5M for 24 h).\nAs shown in Figure 3, Poly(I:C) treatment increased NFKB expression, validating the Poly(I:C) responsiveness of A549 cells. Regarding importin genes, KPNA7 and KPNA5 expressions were reduced in the presence of IVM and ATV alone or in combination. Particularly, KPNA7 expression was significantly decreased by IVM and IVM combined with ATV while KPNA5 expression was significantly lower with ATV and IVM alone. KPNA2 expression was not altered by either Poly(I:C) stimulation or ATV and IVM treatments (Figure 3 and Figure S3A). Regarding Rho GTPases, gene expression of RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42 was not altered by Poly(I:C). ATV treatment, alone or in combination, increased RHOA expression (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively). Conversely, RAC1 expression was significantly downregulated in the presence of ATV (p < 0.01) or IVM (p < 0.01) while CDC42 expression was significantly decreased by ATV (p < 0.05) (Figure 3 and Figure S4A). In parallel, we assessed the GSE8686 dataset that comprises human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) treated or not with the same concentration of ATV (10 \u00b5M 24 h). The data reflect a significant downregulation of RHOA and RAC1 at the transcriptional level (Figure S4B).\n\n## 3.5. Effect of IVM and ATV on Importin \u03b1 Nuclear Accumulation\nNext, we sought to evaluate the effect of IVM on importin \u03b1 cellular distribution. Cells were exposed to 2.5 \u03bcM IVM for 1 h and nuclear to cytoplasmic importin \u03b1 distribution was evaluated in Hela and Vero cells by confocal microscopy. IVM significantly reduced nuclear accumulation in both cell lines, showing a 20% decrease in comparison to vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05; p < 0.0001, respectively) (Figure 4A,B). Representative confocal images of Hela cells are shown in Figure 4C. To discard any direct cytotoxic effects of the compound, we evaluated cell viability after 48 h-incubation with increasing concentrations of IVM. As shown in Figure S5, there were no signs of cytotoxicity when cells were treated with 2.5 \u00b5M IVM. Additionally, as a positive control of importin \u03b1 nuclear accumulation, cells were exposed to an oxidative stress condition induced by hydrogen peroxide [31]. After 1 h-incubation using 200 \u03bcM of hydrogen peroxide, a significant increase in 30% in importin \u03b1 nuclear accumulation was observed (p < 0.05) (Figure S6).\nAs previously mentioned, ATV is a lipophilic statin that affects actin cytoskeleton organization and, as a consequence, is known to alter protein transport in host cells after 24 h-treatment [8,32]. In this context, we evaluated if ATV was particularly capable of altering importin \u03b1 cellular distribution in Hela and Vero cells. Long-term treatment with 10 \u03bcM ATV during 24 h caused a significant reduction in importin \u03b1 nuclear accumulation in both cell lines, decreasing its nuclear to cytoplasmic localization ratio by 25 and 17%, respectively (p < 0.0001) (Figure 4D,E). Representative confocal images of ATV-treated Hela cells are shown in Figure 4F. Short-term exposure to ATV during 1 or 6 h did not have any impact on importin \u03b1 cellular distribution (Figure S7).\n\n## 3.6. Combinational Effect of IVM Plus ATV Treatment on Importin \u03b1 Nuclear Accumulation\nConsidering the effect on protein trafficking in general and on importin \u03b1 cellular distribution in particular, the combination of IVM and ATV appears to be an interesting approach in order to achieve greater host-mediated antiviral responses. We further evaluated the effect of ATV addition to previously tested IVM concentration (2.5 \u00b5M for 1 h). In both cell lines, the combined treatment resulted in a significant decrease in nuclear to cytoplasmic importin \u03b1 distribution when compared to vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.01, Hela; p < 0.0001, Vero). Even though in Hela cells the combination of IVM and ATV had an equivalent effect on importin \u03b1 nuclear accumulation than individual treatments, in Vero cells, combined treatments showed an additive inhibition of importin \u03b1 nuclear accumulation when compared to each monotherapy (p < 0.001) (Figure 5A,B). Additionally, it is worth noting that the reduction in nuclear to cytoplasmic importin \u03b1 distribution in treated cells was accompanied by a consistent increase in perinuclear importin \u03b1 accumulation. This perinuclear rim pattern was observed especially in IVM-treated cells, alone or plus ATV, being possibly related to impaired importin heterodimer formation in the nuclear proximity.\n\n## 3.7. Reduction of Importin \u03b1 Nuclear Accumulation Using a >10-Fold Lower IVM Concentration\nRecent results of our proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial showed a relationship between drug exposure and antiviral activity in patients with plasma IVM concentrations of 160 ng/mL or higher [7]. Taking into account that the equivalent concentration for in vitro cell treatment results in approximately 0.2 \u03bcM, we analyzed the biological effect of this achievable, safe, and clinically-relevant concentration. As shown in Figure 6, exposure for 24 h to an IVM concentration of 0.2 \u03bcM caused a similar decrease in importin \u03b1 nuclear accumulation compared to a high IVM concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM for 1 h, reducing nuclear to cytoplasmic importin \u03b1 distribution by nearly 20% in both Hela (Figure 6A) and Vero (Figure 6B) cell lines (p < 0.05; p < 0.0001, respectively).\nAs importin \u03b1 is involved in the nuclear transport of different cargo proteins, we additionally evaluated the functional impact of low concentration IVM on the cellular distribution of one of its reported cargo proteins [5]. As observed in Figure S8, sustained exposure to 0.2 \u03bcM IVM was also associated with a significant reduction in phosphorylated-p53 nuclear import (p < 0.05).\n\n## 3.8. Reduction of Importin \u03b1 Nuclear Accumulation Using IVM at Low Concentration in Combination with ATV\nWe finally evaluated the addition of ATV to the low IVM concentration of 0.2 \u03bcM during 24 h. As observed in Figure 7, in all evaluated experimental settings nuclear to cytoplasmic importin \u03b1 distribution was significantly reduced when compared to vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.0001). Despite not reaching statistical significance against IVM or ATV monotherapies, larger reductions in importin \u03b1 nuclear accumulation were observed after IVM plus ATV combined treatments, showing a 38 or 25% reduction in nuclear to cytoplasmic importin \u03b1 localization ratio in the Hela (Figure 7A) or Vero (Figure 7B) cells, respectively.\n\n## 4. Discussion\nIn this work, we have ascertained in patient samples, in an animal model, and in cell cultures in vitro, significant alterations of the importin family at the transcriptional level upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, IVM and ATV had significant effects on the transcriptional activity of importins and Rho GTPases upon mimicked viral infection. However, the main proposed antiviral mechanism of IVM in host cells is thought to be its ability to interfere with the nuclear transport of viral proteins mediated by importins [4,5,33].\nA potent antiviral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 has been communicated using high IVM concentrations of 2.5 \u00b5M [6]. Such concentrations correspond to a plasma concentration of about 2200 ng/mL, which is much higher than the peak plasma level normally expected with the standard ivermectin oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg [34,35]. Thus, the initial enthusiasm for the potential use of IVM in COVID-19 treatment turned into skepticism based on pharmacology data, suggesting that effective tissue concentrations may not be achievable in humans. However, IVM is characterized by a wide therapeutic index, with doses up to 10 times those usually prescribed for antihelmintic indications (2 mg/kg), demonstrating good safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers [36].\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that a concentration as low as 0.2 \u00b5M for 24 h produced a similar effect on the inhibition of importin \u03b1 nuclear to cytoplasmic distribution than a concentration of 2.5 \u00b5M for 1 h. This observation suggests that a sustained exposure to lower concentrations of IVM could indeed interfere with the host cell machinery that the virus requires for replication. Interestingly, results from our clinical trial using a high dose of IVM of 0.6 mg/kg/day for five consecutive days in hospitalized COVID-19 patients demonstrated a concentration-dependent effect on the viral load of respiratory secretions. The viral decay rate was significantly greater in patients with IVM plasma levels of 160 ng/mL or higher [7], a concentration close to the one we observed in vitro effects on importin \u03b1 nuclear localization (0.2 \u00b5M that corresponds to a concentration of 175 ng/mL).\nA recent work by Kern et al. described an in silico model of SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics with acquired immune response to analyze the dynamic impact of different regimens using repurposed drugs for COVID-19 treatment [37]. They found greatest effects for IVM, while other drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir had little to no appreciable effect. However, it is important to note that according to this simulation study, IVM at 0.6 mg/kg/day may have prominent antiviral effects, whereas lower doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day have marginal efficacy [36], which might explain the results of recently published randomized clinical trials that found no clinically significant effects compared to the untreated controls [38]. Since patient safety with multiple-day high-dose IVM regimens was shown [7], the design of further trials to confirm antiviral and clinical efficacy as well as to explore factors involved in oral bioavailability of the drug, seem to be warranted. Nasal spray administration is other attractive alternate route that would allow IVM accumulation in nasopharyngeal tissue [39].\nWe have also showed that ATV at an in vitro concentration of 10 \u00b5M for 24 h is able to reduce importin \u03b1 nuclear localization. Moreover, ATV seemed to increase the inhibitory effect of IVM on importin \u03b1 in certain experimental conditions. Cholesterol depletion produced by lipophilic statins causes the shutdown of host cell signaling events requiring membrane localization such as the Rho GTPases RhoA and CDC42 [9]. In this regard, several functions that are relevant to viral pathogenesis including actin organization and intracellular transport depend on Rho GTPase signaling [40]. This may explain the observed additive effect of ATV and IVM on importin \u03b1 cellular distribution. Accordingly, during the in vitro simulated viral infection, combined treatment using ATV plus IVM as well as both monotherapies separately were capable of reverting Poly(I:C)-induced NF-\u03baB increased expression in A549 cells. Despite ATV, alone or combined with IVM, was shown to increase RhoA mRNA expression in Poly(I:C)-transfected cells, variable results were obtained after analyzing the expression profiles of other Rho GTPases in cells exposed to different compounds. We know that each Rho GTPase is involved in specific events related to cell signaling, motility, and intracellular trafficking. In this regard, RhoA mainly participates in the regulation of endocytosis, Rac1 mediates exocytic transport by interaction with different effector molecules, and CDC42 is a key regulator of vesicle trafficking [9]. These contrasting results, involving up- or downregulation of different Rho GTPase gene expression levels, could be interpreted as specific cellular adaptation mechanisms in response to the effects of the tested drugs. Our work has several limitations that should be noted. Regarding the bioinformatics analysis, access to complete clinical records were unavailable, hence corre",
