  "title": "Covalent small molecule inhibitors of Ca(2+)-bound S100B.",
  "abstract": "Elevated levels of the tumor marker S100B are observed in malignant melanoma, and this EF-hand-containing protein was shown to directly bind wild-type (wt) p53 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, dissociate the p53 tetramer, and inhibit its tumor suppression functions. Likewise, inhibiting S100B with small interfering RNA (siRNA(S100B)) is sufficient to restore wild-type p53 levels and its downstream gene products and induce the arrest of cell growth and UV-dependent apoptosis in malignant melanoma. Therefore, it is a goal to develop S100B inhibitors (SBiXs) that inhibit the S100B-p53 complex and restore active p53 in this deadly cancer. Using a structure-activity relationship by nuclear magnetic resonance approach (SAR by NMR), three persistent binding pockets are found on S100B, termed sites 1-3. While inhibitors that simultaneously bind sites 2 and 3 are in place, no molecules that simultaneously bind all three persistent sites are available. For this purpose, Cys84 was used in this study as a potential means to bridge sites 1 and 2 because it is located in a small crevice between these two deeper pockets on the protein. Using a fluorescence polarization competition assay, several Cys84-modified S100B complexes were identified and examined further. For five such SBiX-S100B complexes, crystallographic structures confirmed their covalent binding to Cys84 near site 2 and thus present straightforward chemical biology strategies for bridging sites 1 and 3. Importantly, one such compound, SC1982, showed an S100B-dependent death response in assays with WM115 malignant melanoma cells, so it will be particularly useful for the design of SBiX molecules with improved affinity and specificity.",

  "full_text": "## Purification\n15N-labeled\nS100B (rat and\nbovine) was expressed and purified (>99%) with methods similar\nto\nthose described previously.37,38 The concentrations\nof S100B stock solutions were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein\nAssay (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA). The S100B was stored at a concentration\nof \u223c10 mM in 0.25 mM Tris (pH 7.2) and 0.25 mM DTT at \u221220\n\u00b0C until use.\n\n## Fluorescence Polarization Competition Assay\n(FPCA)\nThe LOPAC1280 (Sigma-Aldrich) compound library was\nscreened using\nan adaptation of a previously reported fluorescence polarization competition\nassay.35 Briefly, the compounds were screened\nfor binding to Ca2+-loaded S100B by measuring changes in\nfluorescence polarization upon competition with the TAMRA-labeled\nversion of peptide TRTK12, which is derived from CapZ protein residues\n265\u2013276 (TRTKIDWNKILS).\nThe FPCA was performed in 0.2 \u03bcM S100B (rat), 25 nM TAMRA-TRTK12,\n50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.3% DMSO in 1536-well plates with 8 \u03bcL\nper well.\n\n## NMR Spectroscopy\nPurified 15N-labeled S100B\n(rat) protein was dialyzed against 0.25 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.25\nmM DTT and concentrated to 10\u201315 mM using Amicon Ultra centrifugal\nfilter units with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff; the concentration\nwas determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and protein was then\naliquoted and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. The Ca2+-loaded\nS100B\u2013SBiX heteronuclear single-quantum coherence\n(HSQC) samples contained 0.5 mM S100B subunit, 0.625 mM SBiX, 0.34 mM NaN3, 15 mM NaCl, 5% DMSO-d6, 10 mM CaCl2, 10% D2O, 0.2% TPEN, and 10 mM Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.2 with HCl. HSQC\nNMR data were collected at 37 \u00b0C with a Bruker Avance 800 US2\n(800.27 MHz for protons) instrument equipped with pulsed-field gradients,\nfour frequency channels, and triple-resonance, z-axis\ngradient cryogenic probes. Data were processed with NMRPipe, and proton\nchemical shifts were reported with respect to the H2O or\nHDO signal taken as 4.608 ppm relative to external TSP (0.0 ppm).\nThe 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced as previously\ndescribed using the following ratio of the zero-point frequency: 0.10132905\nfor 15N to 1H. A series of three-dimensional\nHNCA, HNCOCA, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 15N-edited\nHMQC-NOESY-HSQC NMR experiments were conducted, and the data were\nsufficient to unambiguously assign all the observable backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift values\nof S100B in the compound-bound state (Figures S1\u2013S5 of the Supporting Information).\n\n## Crystallization\nAll crystallization experiments were\nconducted using vapor diffusion methods and performed as follows using\npurified 15N-labeled S100B (bovine) protein. CaS100B\u2013SBi4172 crystals were grown in sitting drops consisting\nof a 0.75:0.75 \u03bcL protein solution [20 mg/mL S100B, 10 mM cacodylate\n(pH 7.2), 7.5 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM SBi4172 prepared in DMSO-d6] and mother liquor [20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol,\n0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.0), and 7.5 mM CaCl2]. CaS100B\u2013SBi4434\ncrystals were grown in sitting drops consisting of a 0.75:0.75 \u03bcL\nprotein solution [40 mg/mL S100B, 10 mM cacodylate (pH 7.2), 7.5 mM\nCaCl2, and 4 mM SBi4434 prepared in DMSO-d6] and mother liquor [40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1\nM cacodylate (pH 6.0), and 7.5 mM CaCl2]. CaS100B\u2013SC1982 crystals were grown in sitting drops consisting\nof a 0.75:0.75 \u03bcL protein solution [40 mg/mL S100B, 10 mM cacodylate\n(pH 7.2), 7.5 mM CaCl2, and 4 mM SC1982 prepared in DMSO-d6] and mother liquor [40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol,\n0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0), and 7.5 mM CaCl2]. CaS100B\u2013SC1475\ncrystals were grown in sitting drops consisting of a 0.75:0.75 \u03bcL\nprotein solution [40 mg/mL S100B, 10 mM cacodylate (pH 7.2), 7.5 mM\nCaCl2, and 4 mM SC1475 prepared in DMSO-d6] and mother liquor [40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1\nM Bis-Tris (pH 6.0), and 7.5 mM CaCl2]. CaS100B\u2013SC124\ncrystals were grown in sitting drops consisting of a 0.75:0.75 \u03bcL\nprotein solution [40 mg/mL S100B, 10 mM cacodylate (pH 7.2), 7.5 mM\nCaCl2, and 4 mM SC124 prepared in DMSO-d6] and mother liquor [40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1\nM Hepes (pH 7.0), and 7.5 mM CaCl2]. The crystals were\ngrown over a period of 1\u201314 days at 295 K. Crystals were flash-cooled\ndirectly from the crystallization drop.\n\n## Data Collection and Processing\nDiffraction data for CaS100B\u2013SBi4172 crystals\nwere collected at the Northeastern\nCollaborative Access Team (NE-CAT) 24ID-C beamline at the Advanced\nPhoton Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). Data were\nrecorded at 100 K on a PILATUS detector and processed by NE-CAT\u2019s\nRAPD automated processing (https://rapd.nec.aps.anl.gov/rapd), which uses XDS39 for integration and\nscaling. A 1.73 \u00c5 data set was collected at a wavelength of 0.97920\n\u00c5 while the crystal was being oscillated by 1.0\u00b0 each frame.\nThe space group was determined to be P21.\nDiffraction\ndata for CaS100B\u2013SC124, CaS100B\u2013SBi4434,\nand CaS100B\u2013SC1982 crystals were collected remotely40,41 at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamline 7-1.\nData were recorded at 100 K on an ADSC Q315 (315 mm \u00d7 315 mm)\ndetector with collection strategies generated by BLU-ICE.42CaS100B\u2013SC124 and CaS100B\u2013SC1982 data sets were processed and integrated by AUTOXDS,43 while S100B\u2013SBi4434 data sets were processed\nand integrated by MOSFLM44 within the CCP4\nprogram suite.45 A 1.58 \u00c5 CaS100B\u2013SC124 data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.1271\n\u00c5 while the crystal was being oscillated by 0.6\u00b0 each frame.\nThe space group was determined to be P21. A 1.08\n\u00c5 CaS100B\u2013SBi4434 data set was collected at\na wavelength of 1.00 \u00c5 while the crystal was being oscillated\nby 0.35\u00b0 each frame. The space group was determined to be P21. A 1.65 \u00c5 CaS100B\u2013SC1982 data\nset was collected at a wavelength of 1.1271 \u00c5 while the crystal\nwas being oscillated 0.45\u00b0 each frame. The space group was determined\nto be C2221.\nDiffraction data for CaS100B\u2013SC1475 crystals\nwere collected remotely40,41 at Stanford Synchrotron\nRadiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamline 12-2. Data were recorded at\n100 K on a PILATUS detector with collection strategies generated by\nBLU-ICE,42 and processing and integration\nwere performed by AUTOXDS.43 A 2.18 \u00c5\ndata set was collected at a wavelength of 0.97950 \u00c5 while the\ncrystal was being oscillated by 0.15\u00b0 each frame. The space group\nwas determined to be P21. Diffraction data statistics\nare summarized in Table 1.\n\n## Structure\nDetermination and Refinement\nTo determine\nthe structure of CaS100B in complex with SBiXs, we performed molecular replacement (MR). A search model from a\nprevious S100B structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1MHO(46,47)] was generated by removing coordinates for ligands and water. Molecular\nreplacement was conducted within the AUTOMR48 function of the PHENIX49 software suite.\nThe models were finished by manual building within COOT.50 The models were refined by the PHENIX.REFINE51 function of the PHENIX49 software suite. Ligands and waters were incorporated into the models\nby visual inspection of the |Fo| \u2013\n|Fc| omit maps. The structure refinement\nstatistics are summarized in Table 1.\n\n## Cell-Based Assay with WM115 Malignant Melanoma Cells\nThe\nmalignant melanoma cell line, WM115, was obtained from American\nType Tissue Collection (ATCC) and cultured in minimum essential medium\n(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum\n(FBS) and 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin (PS). The cells were\ninfected with SMARTvector 2.0 lentiviral particles containing either\nnontargeting scrambled or anti-S100B shRNA according to manufacturer\u2019s\nrecommendations (Thermo Scientific-Dharmacon). The following day,\nthe medium containing lentivirus was removed, the cells were washed\ntwice with PBS and trypsinized, and each well was expanded into a\n24-well plate containing growth medium supplemented with puromycin\n(0.5 \u03bcg/mL). Upon confluence, the wells were trypsinized and\nsingle-cell diluted into 96-well plates. Positive clones with a reduction\nin the level of S100B protein expression were maintained in puromycin-containing\nmedium.52\nA cellular screen was then\ndeveloped with these WM115 cell lines, and further test compounds\nwere shown to bind S100B in vitro. In this cellular\nassay, the ability of SBiX molecules to inhibit the\ngrowth of WM115 melanoma cells infected with shRNA lentivirus (Dharmacon)\ntargeting S100B (shRNAS100B, i.e., low S100B) or a scrambled\ncontrol (shRNAscrambled, i.e., high S100B) was examined\nquantitatively. The methods used were similar to those used previously\nand included the use of a Biomek FX Laboratory Automation Workstation\n(Beckman-Coulter) equipped with a 96-channel pipetting head.53 Specifically, 20 \u03bcL of MEM (Corning) supplemented\nwith 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 \u03bcg/mL puromycin, and 1% Pen/Strep\nwas added to each well of a 384-well, clear bottom, tissue culture\nplate (Corning) containing 600 cells per well such that growing uninhibited\nthey reach 80% confluence in 5 days. After the cells had grown for\n24 h at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidity-controlled incubator,\n20 \u03bcL of the compound was added directly to the cell culture\nmedium, while control cultures received an equivalent amount of DMSO.\nAfter being incubated for an additional 4 days, the cells were lysed\nby transferring 20 \u03bcL of lysis buffer consisting of 1.8% Igepal\nwith a 1:10000 dilution of SYBR Green I (10000\u00d7, Invitrogen)\nto each well. The plates were then returned to the incubator for 24\nh. The fluorescence intensity was then read through the bottom of\nthe plate using a PolarStar fluorescent plate reader (BMG) using 485\nnm excitation and 520 nm emission filters. The SYBR Green fluorescence\nis used to measure total DNA that in turn correlates with the cell\nnumber as previously described.54 The EC50 of each compound was determined using serial dilutions and\nperformed in a minimum of three replicates. Hill curves of each replicate\nwere generated using Origin Data Analysis Software.\nTo analyze\nchanges in total p53 protein levels upon treatment with\nSC1982, WM115 cells were seeded in triplicate at a density of 70 \u00d7\n105 cells in 60 mm dishes in 1\u00d7 MEM (Cellgro) supplemented\nwith 10% FBS, 100 units/mL PS, and 0.5 \u03bcg/mL puromycin and allowed\nto adhere overnight. The following day, the old medium was removed\nand new medium containing 5 \u03bcM SC1982 or DMSO was added. The\ncells were harvested 4 h post-treatment using cold 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis\nbuffer [0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid,\n10% Igepal, and 10 mM EDTA] and subjected to Western blotting.\nWestern blotting was performed using 30 \u03bcg of cell lysates\nloaded on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\ngel (NuPage), which was subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes\n(Millipore) and reacted with p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (DO-1,\nSanta Cruz), mouse anti-S100B antibody (BD Biosciences), and mouse\nanti-GAPDH antibody at dilutions recommended by the manufacturers.\nThe blots were then reacted with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies\n(Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) and treated with Immobilon Western\nChemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) at dilutions recommended\nby the manufacturer.\n\n## Results\nThe binding of CaS100B to p53 downregulates tumor suppressor\nactivity in cancer cells such as malignant melanoma,18,24 so a search for small molecule inhibitors that bind CaS100B and prevent formation of the CaS100B\u2013p53\ncomplex was undertaken. A fluorescence polarization competition assay\n(FPCA) was performed against the 1280-compound Library of Pharmacologically\nActive Compounds (LOPAC1280). Because of the location\nof Cys84 within the CaS100B binding pocket (i.e., between\nsites 1 and 3), the focus of this investigation was a series of covalent\ncomplexes from this that were predicted to covalently bind at Cys84\nof CaS100B. SBi4172 is a structural analogue of the covalent\nmodifier SC084435 and was thought to bind\nsimilarly. SC124, or disulfiram, is a known covalent modifier.55 The chemical nature of SBi4434 suggests the\npossibility of adduct formation and is confirmed here. To gain additional\nopportunities for characterization of covalent adducts, compounds\nwere also taken from a previously reported screen versus the 2000-compound\nSpectrum Collection.35 The compounds characterized\nin this study include SC1982 and SC1475, which were reported in the\nprevious study as being dependent on Cys84 for binding, but the formed\ncovalent adducts were not investigated.35 Cellular and biophysical characterization of these covalently bound\ninhibitors was explored, including their three-dimensional structures\nwhen bound to CaS100B (Tables 1\u20134).\n\n## NMR Studies\nBackbone resonance assignments were completed\nfor each SBiX\u2013S100B complex using standard\nmultidimensional heteronuclear NMR data, and the chemical shift perturbations\nin CaS100B (with or without the compound) were evaluated\nas described for other S100B inhibitors.31,33\u221236 In general, the SBiX complexes studied here showed\nthe largest perturbations within a well-defined binding pocket of CaS100B comprising helices 3 and 4 and loop 2 (termed the \u201chinge\u201d\nregion). These observations are consistent with the FPCA, which identified\nSBiXs that compete with TRTK12 peptide binding.\n\n## Chemical\nShift Assignments\nTitrations of compound into CaS100B were monitored using 1H\u201315N HSQC\nNMR experiments, as previously described.32\u221234 Because perturbations\nwere not always easily tracked during the titration, a series of HNCA,\nHNCOCA, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 15N-HNH (HMQC-NOESY-HSQC)\nNMR experiments were collected at the end of each titration to unambiguously\nassign all the chemical shift values in the compound-bound state.\nThe reaction products for five small molecules (SC124, SC1475, SC1982,\nSBi4172, and SBi4434) bound to CaS100B were assessed by\nmonitoring perturbations of backbone 1H\u201315N HSQC correlations after the compounds were added and fully reacted\n(Figure 2 and Figures S1\u2013S5 of the Supporting Information).\nIn the presence of SC124, many of the 1H\u201315N HSQC correlations of CaS100B were\nperturbed,\nwith the most significant perturbations (\u2265mean \u00b1 SD) occurring\nfor residues in loop 2 (His42) and helix 4 (Ser78, Thr81, Thr82, Ala83,\nGlu86, Phe87, and His90). Likewise, several other residues in loop\n2 (Phe43, Leu44, Glu45, and Glu46) and helix 4 (Cys84, His85, and\nGlu89) either broadened and/or disappeared upon addition of SC124.\nSimilarly, residues in loop 2 and helix 4 were perturbed for modifications\nvia SC1982 (loop 2, His42 and Leu44; helix 4, Ser78, Thr82, Ala83,\nCys84, His85, Glu86, and Glu89) and SBi4434 (loop 2, Ser41, His42,\nand Phe43; helix 4, Thr81, Thr82, Ala83, Cys84, His85, and Glu86).\nFor SC1475, changes in loop 2 (His42 and Lys48), helix 4 (Val80, Thr81,\nThr82, and His85), and helix 1 (Met7) were found in solution. These\ndata are all consistent with the notion that SC124, SC1475, and SC1982\nall react with Cys84 because loop 2 and helix 4 are in the proximity\nof each other in the crystallographic structures of CaS100B\nand have been previously described to facilitate the binding of small\nmolecules. For SBi4172, the chemical shift perturbations during the\nreaction could not be measured because the compound induced aggregation\nof CaS100B (Figure S4 of the Supporting\nInformation). To further characterize the structural impact\nof covalent modifications at Cys84 on CaS100B, we next\ndetermined the structures of the S100B complexes with each compound\nby X-ray crystallography.\n\n## Covalent\nModifications at Cys84 Affect Target Binding of \nThe structures of CaS100B\u2013inhibitor\ncomplexes (SC124, SC1475, SC1982, SBi4172, and SBi4434) are compared,\neach of which was confirmed to have the SBiX molecule\ncovalently bound to Cys84 of CaS100B (Figure 3). In all five of these structural models, each CaS100B subunit consists of four helices (helix 1, E2\u2013G19; helix\n2, K28\u2013L40; helix 3, E49\u2013D61; helix 4, D69\u2013F88),\ntwo small antiparallel \u03b2-strands, and a Ca2+ ion\nbound to both the typical and noncanonical EF-hand calcium binding\ndomains. Likewise, the typical EF-hand is in the \u201copen\u201d\nCa2+-bound conformation, as is generally found in CaS100B structures,25 and the dimer\ninterface is aligned as a symmetric X-type four-helix bundle comprising\nhelices 1, 1\u2032, 4, and 4\u2032.32,34\u221236,47 Comparison of these five structures\nto that of CaS100B (PDB entry 1MHO(47)) with no\ndrug target reveals a strong conservation of the global fold (Table 3); however, deviations in the positions of several\nside chains in the target binding site of CaS100B were\nobserved, as necessary, to accommodate the binding of various SBiX molecules. These include residues in helix 4 and/or loop\n4 and in helix 1 (i.e., His15) in some cases, as described below (i.e.,\nfor the CaS100B\u2013SC124 complex). The specifics of\neach structure also provide details of potential synthetic strategies\nfor engineering a single molecule that occupies all three persistent\n\u201cpockets\u201d within the S100B target binding site, so the\nindividual structures and specific structural changes will be discussed\nin some detail.\n\nThe X-ray structure\nof a product resulting from mixing SC124 (disulfiram) with Ca2+-bound S100B (CaS100B\u2013SC124) was determined\nat 1.58 \u00c5 resolution (Figure 4). The asymmetric\nunit included two CaS100B subunits (chains A and B) forming\nthe biologically active form of dimeric CaS100B. Residues\nMet0\u2013Phe88 and Met0\u2013Glu89 were modeled in chains A and\nB, respectively. In the final refined model (Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.215\nand 0.253, respectively), all residues were in the favored (100%)\nregions of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers (Table 1). Each subunit of CaS100B\u2013SC124\nwas found to coordinate two calcium ions as is typical of S100 proteins,38 and electron density was also clearly observed\nin the target binding sites for each subunit of CaS100B\nas a result of nucleophilic attack of Cys84 by SC124 (Figures 3 and 4). The structure of\nthe bound product was also consistent with what has been found previously\nwith other protein adducts involving SC12455 (Figure 3). Interestingly, though, the Cys84-bound\nSC124 adduct has somewhat different positions in each subunit of CaS100B, and this was the first indication that this region,\ntermed site 2, of CaS100B can accommodate various orientations\nfor small inhibitors. Curiously, the binding of SC124 causes the side\nchain of Glu89 in one subunit to occupy a pocket that can tightly\ncoordinate a Zn2+ ion,36,56,57 and as a result, His15 is reoriented. Note, in Zn2+-bound structures of CaS100B described elsewhere,36,56,57 Zn2+ is coordinated\nby residues His15, His25, His85, and Glu89.\n\n## S100B\u2013SC1475\nThe X-ray structure of a product\nresulting from mixing SC1475 (3,4-dimethoxydalbergione) with Ca2+-bound S100B (CaS100B\u2013SC1475) was determined\nat 2.18 \u00c5 resolution (Figure 5). The asymmetric\nunit included two CaS100B subunits (chains X and A) of CaS100B, and in both chains, residues Met0\u2013Glu89 were\nmodeled into the electron density. In the final refined structure\n(Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.213 and 0.251, respectively), all residues were in the\nmost favored (98.9%) or allowed (1.1%) regions of the Ramachandran\nplot with no outliers (see Table 1). In each\nsubunit, two Ca2+ ions, one SC1475 molecule, and 19 waters\nwere resolved from the calculated electron density of the CaS100B\u2013SC1475 structure. It was also clear that SC1475 covalently\nmodified CaS100B via nucleophilic substitution of Cys84\ninto the benzoquinone moiety of the drug. Such a reaction is not uncommon,\nhas been observed in toxic metabolites of acetaminophen, and results\nin the tautomerization of the moiety (Figure 3), as previously found.58 Upon inspection,\nno hydrogen bonds were observed from residues of CaS100B\nto SC1475, but the small molecule was situated in a hydrophobic pocket\ndefined by residues in loop 2, termed the \u201chinge region\u201d\nof S100B (Phe43) and helix 4 (Ile80, Ala83, Phe87, and Phe88). Specifically,\nthe hydroquinone moiety of SC1475 stacks with Phe43, and the alkene\nmoiety aligns favorably with the aromatic ring of Phe87. His15 is\nobserved to swing outward from the Zn2+ binding site as\nobserved in other CaS100B\u2013SBiX structures,\nand unlike CaS100B complexes of SBi4172, SC124, and SC1982,\nGlu89 does not invade the Zn2+ binding site (vide\ninfra).\n\nThe X-ray structure\nof CaS100B bound to SC1982 (Rubescensin A; CaS100B\u2013SC1982) was determined at 1.65 \u00c5 resolution (Figure 6). The asymmetric unit contained one CaS100B subunit, and density for Met0\u2013Glu91 could be readily\nmodeled with the second subunit mapped on the basis of its location\nwithin the crystal symmetry. In the final refined model (Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.177\nand 0.214, respectively), all residues were in the highly favored\n(100%) region of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers (Table 1). Each subunit of CaS100B\u2013SC1982\nwas found to coordinate two Ca2+ ions (one in each EF-hand),\nand one SC1982 molecule occupied each of the target protein binding\nsites via covalent modification (in the region termed site 2). Specifically,\nthe alkene of SC1982 is reduced via Michael addition from the thiol\nof Cys84 from CaS100B59 (Figure 3). After covalent attachment, SC1982 makes two hydrogen\nbonds to the backbone carbonyls of loop 2 (His42 and Phe43) and forms\nseveral hydrophobic interactions with residues in the target binding\npocket of CaS100B, including those in loop 2 (Phe43) and\nhelix 4 (Ile80, Phe87, and Phe88). His15 is once again observed to\nmove outward from the Zn2+ binding site, and like the structures\nof CaS100B\u2013SC124 and CaS100B\u2013SBi4172,\nthe covalent binding of SC1982 causes the side chain of Glu89 to intrude\ninto a region of the protein, which can bind Zn2+, and\ncauses the side chain of His15 to rotate away fairly drastically.\nElectron density for a highly coordinated atom\nthat is too dense\nto be water was identified. As calcium is prevalent in the system\nand because of the identity of the contributors in the coordination\n(Asp63, Asp69, and six water molecules), a third calcium ion was modeled\ninto this density (confirmed by anomalous difference maps).\n\nThe X-ray structure\nof chelerythrine-bound CaS100B, CaS100B\u2013SBi4172,\nwas determined at 1.73 \u00c5 resolution (Figure 7). The asymmetric unit in the drug complex included two S100B\nsubunits (chains A and B) forming the biologically active dimeric\nform of CaS100B. In chain A, residues Met0\u2013Glu89\nwere modeled into the electron density, and in chain B, only Ser1\u2013Glu89\ncould be resolved. Each subunit of the CaS100B\u2013SBi4172\ncomplex coordinated two Ca2+ ions; however, only one molecule\nof SBi4172 could be observed and was located in the model for chain\nB. Sparse density was observed in the analogous binding pocket of\nchain A, but it was not sufficiently well defined for accurate modeling\nof the SBi4172 inhibitor. A more detailed analysis of chain A showed\nthat a lack of density in the second subunit likely occurred as a\nresult of spatial restraints imposed by the crystal packing. In the\nfinal refined model (Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.230 and 0.268, respectively),\nall residues in both subunits were in the favored (98.9%) or allowed\nregions (1.1%) of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers (Table 1). As clearly defined by the calculated electron\ndensity maps, SBi4172 was found to react with Cys84 via hydration\nof a double bond of SBi417260 (Figure 3). Once SBi4172 was covalently bound, a dioxole\noxygen atom of SBi4172 was found to make water-bridged interactions\nwith the backbone carbonyl of Phe43. Otherwise, SBi4172 was situated\nin a hydrophobic pocket composed of side chains within loop 2 (Phe43),\nhelix 4 (Ile80, Ala83, Phe87, and Phe88), and helix 1\u2032 (Val7,\nVal8, and Ile11). Like the earlier inhibitor-bound CaS100B\ncomplexes, the side chain moiety of His15 was found to move out of\nthe established Zn2+ binding site of CaS100B.\n\nThe X-ray structure\nof SBi4434 {2,3-bis[(2-hydroxyethyl)thio]-1,4-naphthoquinone} bound\nto CaS100B (CaS100B\u2013SBi4434) was determined\nat 1.08 \u00c5 resolution (Figure 8). The asymmetric\nunit included two S100B subunits (chains A and X) forming the biologically\nactive dimeric form of S100B. In chain A, residues Met0\u2013Glu91were\nmodeled while only residues Met0\u2013Phe88 of chain X could be\nresolved. Each subunit in the CaS100B\u2013SBi4434 structure\nbound two calcium ions and a SBi4434 molecule. In the final refined\nmodel (Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.192 and 0.211, respectively), all residues\nwere in the favored (99.4%) or allowed regions (0.6%) of the Ramachandran\nplot with no outliers (Table 1). Sole among the structures described here, the high resolution\nof the diffraction data produced by the CaS100B\u2013SBi4434\ncrystal allowed for the inclusion of riding hydrogen atoms in this\nparticular model. As clearly defined by the calculated electron density\nmaps, SBi4434 covalently modifies CaS100B at Cys84. As\nseen, the thiol of Cys84 substitutes for one of the thioglycol moieties\nof SBi4434 (Figure 3). The second thioglycol\nmoiety is allowed much conformational flexibility as evidenced by\nthe sparse electron density for these atoms as well as the alternative\nconformations of the moiety modeled in the two inhibitor molecules.\nThe compound does not make any hydrogen bonds with the protein but\nis nestled in a hydrophobic pocket formed by loop 2 and helix 4 with\nthe aromatic rings of SBi4434 stacked between the side chains of Phe43\nand Phe87. In this model, His85 swings out of the Zn2+ binding\nsite.\nCoordinates and structure factors have been deposited in\nthe Protein\nData Bank as entries 4PE1 for CaS100B\u2013SC124, 4PE4 for CaS100B\u2013SC1475, 4PE7 for CaS100B\u2013SC1982, 4PDZ for CaS100B\u2013SBi4172, and 4PE0 for CaS100B\u2013SBi4434.\n\n## Cell-Based Assay\nTo determine whether\ncovalent modification\nof Cys84 affects cell proliferation in malignant melanoma, its effect\non the growth of WM115 malignant melanoma cells, which express elevated\nlevels of the S100B protein, was measured as described previously.53 Briefly, proliferation of WM115 cells stably\ntransfected with either shRNAscrambled (i.e., high S100B)\nor shRNAS100B (i.e., low S100B) was evaluated in triplicate\nfollowing a 4 day incubation in the absence or presence of each compound\nat varying concentrations (Table 2). For each\ntitration, knockdown of the S100B protein was confirmed by Western\nblot analysis (3-fold decrease; n = 4) (Figure 9), and EC50 values were determined using\nthe average of three or more titrations. With SC1475 as an exception\n(ratio of 1.00), it was found that lower concentrations of SC124,\nSC1982, and SBi4172 were needed to inhibit cell growth with the shRNAscrambled versus the shRNAS100B knockdown WM115\ncells (1.50 < ratio < 3.57). This is consistent with the compounds\nhaving specificity toward S100B-containing cells; however, only titrations\nwith SC1982 were shown to be S100B-selective (1.77-fold) with a statistically\nsignificant t-test (p = 0.001; n = 8). Consistent with this result, p53 levels were 2-fold\nhigher (n = 4) in the presence than in the absence\nof SC1982 (in Figure 9, compare lanes 1 and\n3 and lanes 2 and 4, respectively). This result along with an observation\nof S100B expression-dependent growth inhibition suggests that SC1982\ndisplays an on-target effect of S100B inhibition with subsequent p53\nrestoration. The last compound, SBi4434, showed fluorescence interference\nwith the SYBR Green dye, so it was excluded from further evaluation.\n\n## Discussion\nMalignant melanoma is the fifth and seventh\nmost common cancer\namong men and women,61 respectively, so\nthe discovery of novel therapeutics for its treatment remains a high\npriority. Elevated S100B is a prognostic indicator for assessing disease\nprogression, disease recurrence, and metastatic potential in patients\nwith MM.62\u221268 It is also established that S100B not only is a clinical marker\nbut also binds to and negatively regulates p53 at the protein level.18,19 While the p53 tumor suppressor protein is mutated in many human\ncancers,69 it is typically wild-type (wt,\n>90%) in MM,26,27 so restoring p53 protein by inhibiting\nS100B represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating MM. While\nlow-molecular weight compounds that block the p53 binding site on\nS100B and inhibit formation of the S100B\u2013p53 complex exist,\nimproving their affinity, efficacy, and specificity remains a priority.\nThus, S100B represents a new cancer target, and improved SBiXs should provide novel therapeutic(s) for treating MM by\nrestoring active p53 protein.27\nStructure\u2013function\ncharacterizations of five novel inhibitors\nof the CaS100B\u2013p53 interaction are presented here.\nOf the five compounds, SC1982 has the most significant hydrogen bonding\nnetwork within the CaS100B binding pocket, and interestingly,\nit demonstrated the highest level of target specific activity in the\nWM115 cellular assay. Note that despite the relatively low EC50 of SC124, expectations should be tempered when considering\nthis compound. SC124 is small with a scaffold lacking complexity.\nIt forms no hydrogen bonds with the target protein and lacks even\na consistent binding pose within the two monomers of S100B. These\ndetails leave little potential for SC124 as a therapeutic that would\nnot be sequestered elsewhere within the cell, and unsurprisingly,\nit lacks statistically significant S100B expression-dependent growth\ninhibition.\nSuch target specific effects are important when\nconsidering the\nrelationship between off-target effects and toxicity. This is particularly\nimportant when considering the therapeutic application of covalent\nmodifiers because their off-target effects are not uncommon and are\noften severe. One successful example of a drug linked to the protein\nvia Michael addition is Afatinib, which is used in the treatment of\nmetastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).70,71 The target specific effect of SC1982 (Figure 9 and Table 2) is reassuring and warrants further\ninvestigation as a chemical scaffold for engineering novel SBiX molecules. In fact, SC1982 and each compound presented\nhere offer a new chemical scaffold for continued SAR studies for improving\naffinity and spe",
