  "title": "Insights into idarubicin antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MRSA is a major concern in community settings and in health care. The emergence of biofilms and persister cells substantially increases its antimicrobial resistance. It is very urgent to develop new antimicrobials to solve this problem. OBJECTIVE: Idarubicin was profiled to assess its antimicrobial effects in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We investigated the antimicrobial effects of idarubicin against MRSA by time-kill analysis. The antibiofilm efficacy of idarubicin was assessed by crystal violet and XTT staining, followed by laser confocal microscopy observation. The mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial effects were studied by transmission electron microscopy, all-atom molecular dynamic simulations, SYTOX staining, surface plasma resonance, and DNA gyrase inhibition assay. Further, we addressed the antimicrobial efficacy in wound and subcutaneous abscess infection in vivo. RESULTS: Idarubicin kills MRSA cells by disrupting the lipid bilayers and interrupting the DNA topoisomerase IIA subunits, and idarubicin shows synergistic antimicrobial effects with fosfomycin. Through synergy with a single dose treatment fosfomycin and the addition of the cell protector amifostine, the cytotoxicity and cardiotoxicity of idarubicin were significantly reduced without affecting its antimicrobial effects. Idarubicin alone or in combination with fosfomycin exhibited considerable efficacy in a subcutaneous abscess mouse model of MRSA infection. In addition, idarubicin also showed a low probability of causing resistance and good postantibiotic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Idarubicin and its analogs have the potential to become a new class of antimicrobials for the treatment of MRSA-related infections.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nStaphylococcus aureus is one of the most common gram-positive opportunistic human pathogens, which is carried by approximately 30% of the human population [1]. Despite antibiotic availability, S. aureus-related infections often remain one of the main causes of death and are difficult to cure [2]. The relatively high burden of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in community and health-care settings is a major concern worldwide [3]. Additionally, the emergence of linezolid (LZD) [4] and vancomycin (VAN) [3] resistant strains has been sporadically reported worldwide. In addition, the emergence of persister cells and biofilms significantly increases antimicrobial resistance, which makes conventional antibiotics that target cellular growth processes ineffective, resulting in high clinical failure rates of antibiotic therapy [5].\nS. aureus causes many kinds of human infections and syndromes, with the most common forms of infection being skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) [6]. Among them, the most common bacterial infections in children are acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [7]. In military personnel with these types of infections, 91% are caused by S. aureus (70% of them are MRSA strains), with 4\u20136% ultimately experiencing an SSTI [8]. Moreover, high bacterial loads of greater than 108 CFU/ml are present in SSTIs, highlighting the importance of investigating high bacterial density infections. SSTIs, such as pus-filled pockets infiltrated by immune cells and bacteria, also known as abscesses, form fluid and are often highly resistant to conventional antibiotic treatment. Thus, the development of new antibiotics against persistent S. aureus is an urgent issue [9].\nThe development of new antimicrobials is a very slow process and is frequently beset with a large number of obstacles [10,11]. Repurposing approved drugs is a promising alternative strategy, and these drugs have the ability to go directly to preclinical and clinical trials, reducing cost and time [12].\nIdarubicin (IDAR) is a type of anthracycline antibiotic used for acute myeloid leukemia therapy [13]. Mammalian DNA topoisomerase II is the target of anticancer anthracyclines that act by stabilizing enzyme-DNA complexes wherein DNA strands are cut and covalently linked to the protein. This molecular mechanism is the basis of anthracycline anticancer activity, as well as the toxic effects [14]. It has been demonstrated that IDAR and doxorubicin can inhibit the growth of gram-positive cocci in blood culture bottles in vitro [15,16]. However, there has been no systematic study on the antimicrobial mechanisms of IDAR or its in vivo efficacy.\nThus, in the present study, we present a detailed bioanalysis of IDAR as an antimicrobial, including its mechanism and in vivo efficacy against MRSA in acute skin infection and subcutaneous abscess infection models. Then, we attempted to decrease the cytotoxicity of IDAR by topically use with the addition of the cell protector amifostine (AMI) and by combination with fosfomycin (FOS).\n\n## Bacterial strains and growth conditions\nThe details of bacterial strains and growth conditions were described at Supplementary methods 1.\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility tests using the microdilution assay\nThe minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of antibiotics and IDAR were determined using the microdilution assay strictly according to the recommendations of the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [17].\n\n## Disc diffusion assay\nAn overnight culture of S. aureus was diluted in fresh TSB broth and cultured to mid-log phase. The suspension was diluted to the equivalent of 0.5 McFarland standard and then 150\u00a0\u03bcl was spread onto an MH agar plate. After air drying for 10\u00a0min, disks loaded with 5\u00a0\u03bcg ciprofloxacin (CIP), 20\u00a0\u03bcg VAN, or 20\u00a0\u03bcg IDAR were placed onto the agar. Disks loaded with 2% DMSO were included as a negative control. The plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16\u201318\u00a0h. The diameter of the inhibitory circle was measured with a caliper [18].\n\n## Killing kinetics assay\nTubes containing MH broth were inoculated with a suspension of S. aureus to a final count of approximately 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 CFU/mL. The tubes were then incubated at 37\u00b0C, 200 rpm. Viable counts and culture turbidity were determined by plate counts and by measuring the optical density at 630\u00a0nm (OD630), respectively, at time points 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24\u00a0h after the addition of IDAR at the indicated concentrations [19].\n\n## Persister killing assay\nTo obtain persisters from a biofilm culture, a mid-log growth-phase culture of S. aureus was diluted in BHI broth to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 CFU/ml. One hundred microliters of this suspension was transferred to the wells of a microplate. The plates were then sealed with parafilm and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere for 24\u00a0h. Planktonic bacteria were removed by washing twice with 1 \u00d7\u00a0PBS (pH\u00a0=\u00a07.0), and biofilms were exposed to 100\u00a0\u03bcl of BHI broth containing rifampicin (RFP, 100 \u00d7\u00a0MIC). After 24\u00a0h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, planktonic cells were removed and any remaining attached bacteria were dislodged in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS by sonication. Bacteria were subsequently exposed to 200\u00a0\u03bcl of PBS containing a 2 \u00d7\u00a0MIC of IDAR. Bacteria exposed to PBS without IDAR were included as a control. The number of viable cells was determined by plate counts every 2\u00a0h for a total of 6\u00a0h [20].\n\n## Biofilm inhibition assay\nOvernight cultures of MRSA were diluted 1:200 in fresh TSB broth with or without antimicrobials at intended concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 128\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, and then 200\u00a0\u03bcl were inoculated into the wells of microplates in triplicate. After static incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the planktonic cells were removed by washing with PBS, and the remaining biofilms were stained with 0.5% crystal violet (CV) for 5\u00a0min, followed by removal by washing with saline. The CV stain was solubilized with 95% ethanol for 15\u00a0min, and the biofilm biomass was determined by measuring absorbance at 570\u00a0nm (A570) [21].\n\n## Biofilm eradication assay\nBiofilms formed as described above were treated with 200\u00a0\u03bcl of antimicrobials at intended concentrations. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for another 24\u00a0h, the remaining biofilms were measured by CV staining as described above, or by XTT assays. For the XTT [(2,3-Bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2\u00a0H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide)] assay [22], 200\u00a0\u03bcl of a solution containing 200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of XTT and 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of phenazine methosulfate (PMS) was added to each well. After incubation for 3\u00a0h at 30\u00b0C in the dark, the absorbance was measured at 490\u00a0nm (A490).\n\n## All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nThe structure of the S. aureus cell membrane was constructed by CHARMM-GUI software. We used the previously established model of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\u02b9-rac-glycerol) (DOPG) at a 7:3 ratio [23]. After filling water molecules and countering ions, equilibrium simulation was performed by Gromacs 2018.4 [24] within 200 ns. The structure information was downloaded from NCBI and the RESP electric charges were calculated at the level of B3LYP/def2TZVP [25]. MD was performed with Gromacs 2018.4 software, hydrogen bonds were restrained by the LINCS algorithm [26], and the interaction of the Particle-mesh Ewald was calculated by the PME algorithm [27]. The cutoff value for nonbonding interactions was set as 10\u00a0\u00c5 and was refreshed every 10 steps. The simulation temperature and pressure were control by the V-rescale [28] and Parrinello-Rahman [29] methods, respectively. MD was performed within 500 ns, and the conformation was stored per 20 ps. The simulation results were visualized by the Gromacs and VMD program.\n\n## Molecular docking assay\nMolecular docking was conducted as reported by Werner et al. [30] with minor modifications. The details of molecular docking were described at Supplementary methods 2.\n\n## Protein synthesis and surface plasma resonance assay\nThe gyrA and gyrB genes were amplified by PCR and ligated into the Ndel/Xhol cloning sites of the pET-22b(+) and pET-28a(+) plasmids, respectively. The His*6 and His*10-sumo tags were added to the C-terminal end of gyrA and the N-terminal end of gyrB, respectively, and the gyrB tag was cleaved by TEV. The plasmid was then transferred to competent E. coli (BL21). After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 14\u00a0h, a single colony was picked and cultured to log phase, after which IPTG was used to induce the expression of gyrA and gyrB. After incubation at 18\u00b0C for another 16\u00a0h, the bacterial cells were lysed by ultrasonification in 20\u201330\u00a0ml Tris-HCl (10\u00a0mM, pH 8.0). After centrifugation, the proteins were collected and purified using a Ni affinity chromatography column. The surface plasma resonance (SPR) was performed with Biacore S200 and bio-sensor chip S-CM5 (Supplementary methods 3).\n\n## Enzyme inhibition assay\nSupercoiled and relaxed DNA of pBR322 were purchased from Fenghui Biotechnologies Inc. (Changsha, China). S. aureus DNA gyrase and 5\u00d7\u00a0reaction buffer [40\u00a0mM Hepes KOH (pH 7.6), 500\u00a0mM potassium glutamate, 2\u00a0mM ATP, 0.05 mg/ml albumin, and 10\u00a0mM DTT] were obtained from Enzo Biochem (New York, America). The efficacy of DNA gyrase to supercoil relaxed DNA in the presence of ciprofloxacin (CIP, positive control) and IDAR was determined by gel electrophoresis [30,31].\n\n## Bacterial membrane permeability assay\nLog-phase bacterial suspensions in MH broth were centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 3000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g and resuspended in 2 mL HEPES buffer (10\u00a0mM, pH\u00a0=\u00a07.4, 150\u00a0mM NaCl) to a final concentration of\u00a0approximately 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 CFU/ml. Then, twofold dilutions of IDAR from 0.5 to 32\u00a0\u03bcg/mL were added to the suspensions. After incubation at 37\u00b0C at 200 rpm for 1\u00a0h, SYTOX Green was added to a final concentration of 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM and the samples were incubated for 10\u00a0min on the ice, protected from light. The intensity of fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto) (San Jose, CA, USA). A viability assay by plate counting was performed to eliminate the influence of cell lysis on permeability [32].\n\n## Drug combination assay\nThe synergistic interaction between IDAR and antibiotics of different classes was determined using the checkerboard method. Diluted bacterial cells at mid-log phase (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 CFU/ml) were dispensed into microtiter plates and a two-dimensional checkerboard with twofold dilutions of IDAR and other antibiotics (FOS, amikacin (AMK), CIP, teicoplanin (TEC), gentamycin (GEN), VAN) were set up. The results were determined after 16\u201320\u00a0h of incubation at 37\u00b0C by measuring the OD630. The interaction was assessed by determining the optimal fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) using the following equation: FICI\u00a0=\u00a0FICA+FICB (FIC\u00a0=\u00a0MIC in combination/MIC alone). The FICI was interpreted as follows: FICI<0.5, indicates synergism; 0.5\u2264\u00a0FICI<1, indicates partial synergy; FICI\u00a0=\u00a01, indicates additive effects; FICI>4, indicates antagonism [33].\n\n## Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)\nBiofilms formed on coverslips were rinsed with PBS to remove unattached cells, then stained with a mix of SYTO9 (for all cells) and PI (for dead cells) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China). The coverslips were imaged using a CLSM (Zeiss LSM 800, Jena, Germany), and biofilm quantification was performed with ZEN 2012 software [34].\n\n## Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nS. aureus ATCC 43300 was grown to exponential phase at 37\u00b0C, 200 rpm. The bacterial cells were treated with IDAR at a concentration of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (5 \u00d7\u00a0MIC) at 37\u00b0C, 200 rpm for 1\u00a0h. After cell collection by centrifugation, the TEM was performed (Supplementary methods 4).\n\n## Resistance induction assay\nThe details of resistance induction assay were described at the Supplementary methods 5.\n\n## Animals\nThe project and animal experiment were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (No. 2019sydw0211). The details of animal experiments were described at the Supplementary methods 6.\n\n## Bactericidal activity of IDAR against MRSA and \nIDAR showed strong bactericidal effects against S. aureus (including MSSA and MRSA), and S. epidermidis with MICs and MBCs of 2\u20134\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 4\u201332\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. Though IDAR alone only showed weak or no antimicrobial effects against gram-negative bacteria such as A. baumannii with an MIC of 32\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, and E. coli and K. pneumoniae with MICs >128\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. However, when combined with sub-MIC levels of polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), an analog of polymyxin B with strong cell permeability ability but weak antimicrobial effects [35], the MICs of A. baumannii, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae were decreased to 16, 32, and 128\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. Additionally, C. albicans showed moderate susceptibility with an MIC and MBC of 64\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. However, there were no effects on E. faecalis or P. aeruginosa in the presence/absence of PMBN with MICs >128\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (Table 1). Similarly, IDAR also exhibited strong bactericidal activity against the MSSA, MRSA, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) clinical isolates with MICs of 1\u20134\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (Table S1).Table 1.Antimicrobial susceptibility test.StrainsMIC (\u03bcg/ml)MBC (\u03bcg/ml)S. aureus\u00a0\u00a0MSSA\u00a0\u00a0ATCC2592348Newman24MRSA\u00a0\u00a0ATCC43300a48MIC50 (n =\u00a026)4MIC90 (n =\u00a026)2\u00a0~\u00a04S. epidermidis\u00a0\u00a0RP62Aa432ATCC1222848E. faecalis\u00a0\u00a0ATCC29212a>128>128A. baumannii\u00a0\u00a0ATCC119532128+PMBN16128E. coli\u00a0\u00a0ATCC25922>128>128+PMBN3264P. aeruginosa\u00a0\u00a0PAO1a>128>128+PMBN>128>128K. pneumoniae\u00a0\u00a0ATCC700603>128>128+PMBN128128C. albicans\u00a0\u00a0ATCC140536464abiofilm-forming strains.MSSA: Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.MRSA: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\nUsing the disc dilution method, MRSA was more susceptible to IDAR (20\u00a0\u03bcg/disc) compared to VAN (20\u00a0\u03bcg/disc), but less susceptible than CIP (5\u00a0\u03bcg/disc) (Figure 1(a)). IDAR showed dose-dependent antimicrobial effects against MRSA from 0.875 to 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (Figure 1(b)). IDAR could inhibit cell growth at concentrations of \u22650.5 \u00d7\u00a0MIC (Figure 1(c)). Additionally, strong bactericidal effects were observed with IDAR concentrations \u22651 \u00d7\u00a0MIC, with the bacterial cells completely dead within 8\u00a0h (Figure 1(d)). And 10-fold MIC of IDAR still showed stronger bacteriostatic and even bactericidal activity even in the presence of high density of MRSA cells (approximately 108 CFU/ml) than 10-fold MIC of VAN (Fig. S1 A, B). We found that a 2 \u00d7\u00a0MIC of IDAR could eradicate nearly 100-fold number of persister cells induced by 24\u00a0h treatment with a 100 \u00d7\u00a0MIC of RFP, compared to untreated persisters after 6\u00a0h (Figure 1(e)). Sub-MIC levels of CIP could induce antibiotic resistance via the stress response, and we found that the MIC of CIP was increased by up to 256-fold in the presence of sub-MIC values of CIP over 16 passages. However, IDAR still maintained nearly the same susceptibility profile among cells in the presence of sub-MIC values of IDAR for 16 passages (Figure 1(f)). In addition, the occurrence of resistant high-density bacterial loads (approximately 109 CFU/plate) was significantly inhibited by IDAR at concentrations \u22652 \u00d7\u00a0MIC (Table 3). In an in vivo acute MRSA infection wound model, 8\u00a0h of treatment with 0.8% IDAR could reduce the bacterial load by nearly threefold compared to the vehicle group (Figure 1(g)).Table 2.FICs of antimicrobials against coci.AgentMIC(ug/mL)MICIn combination/MICsinglyFICoptOutcomeSinglyIn combinationFOS1620.1250.25SynergyIDAR40.50.125AMK64160.250.375SynergyIDAR40.50.125CIP10.50.50.75Partial synergyIDAR410.25TEC0.50.250.50.75Partial synergyIDAR410.25GEN10241280.250.75Partial synergyIDAR420.5VAN10.50.51AdditionIDAR420.5\u00a0\u00a0\nTable 3.Frequency of resistance to IDAR.Drugbaseline MIC (\u03bcg/ml)1\u00d7\u00a0MIC2\u00d7\u00a0MIC4\u00d7\u00a0MIC8\u00d7\u00a0MICIDAR45.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128<1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129<1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129<1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129RIP0.0161.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221284.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221281.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221284.15\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\nFigure 1.IDAR exhibits bactericidal activity against MRSA and persister cells.

This result indicates that the biofilm inhibitory effects of IDAR were mainly due to its bactericidal efficacy as shown in Figure 1(b). Additionally, CLSM images showed that IDAR had stronger biofilm inhibitory effects than VAN at the concentration of 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (Figure 2(b)). In accordance with the CLSM images, the fluorescence intensity analysis also showed strong biofilm inhibitory effects of IDAR against MRSA (Figure 2(c)). Similarly, IDAR could also eradicate mature biofilms at a concentration of 2 \u00d7\u00a0MIC (Figure 2(d)). CLSM images also showed that 8\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of IDAR had more significant biofilm eradicating effects compared to VAN at a concentration of 32\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (Figure 2(e)). Similarly, fluorescence intensity analysis showed the strong biofilm eradicating effects of IDAR (figure 2(f)).Figure 2.IDAR inhibits biofilm formation and eradicates preformed biofilms.

IDAR then penetrates into the membrane interior. After penetration, IDAR embeds into the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer and disrupts the integrity of the cell membrane (Figure 3(a)). The number of hydrogen bonds between IDAR and phospholipid membrane is stable at about 2. It shows that the hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction between amino group and phosphate group can stabilize the combination (Fig. S2B, Supplementary Video at https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDQ0MDM5NjYyMA==.html?spm=a2h3j.8428770.3416059.1). The 3-dimensional binding mode showed that small positively charged amino heads form stable hydrogen bonds with negatively charged phosphoric acid groups in phospholipid membranes, while aromatic tails extend into the middle of highly hydrophobic phospholipid membranes, forming strong hydrophobic interactions (Figure 3(b)). Additionally, the bacterial membrane had a low energy barrier toward IDAR and highly favorable transfer energies (Figure 3(c)). TEM images showed the formation of mesosome-like structures, abnormal cell division, abnormal intracellular aggregations, cell membrane damage, and cell lysis in the presence of 5 \u00d7\u00a0MIC of IDAR (Figure 3(d)). Using an SYTOX Green permeability assay, we found that IDAR induced dose-dependent membrane permeability within 1\u00a0h without significant cell viability changes, which indicates that the bactericidal activity of IDAR could be initiated by targeting the cell membrane (Figure 3(e)). To investigate the binding mode of IDAR with proteins, docking simulation studies were carried out. We found that IDAR exhibited better docking model with GyrA and GyrB compared to its intrinsic ligand (Fig. S3-S5 and Table S2). The binding mode of IDAR with GyrA/GyrB is illustrated in Figure 3(f). We found that IDAR interacts with Asp1083 in chain A of GyrA through a hydrogen bond interaction, and with Arg144 and Mg2+\u00a0of GyrB through hydrogen bond interactions and ion contacts, respectively. The computational results indicated that IDAR can interact with GyrA and GyrB. Additionally, in an SPR study, we found that IDAR could significantly interact with GyrA and GyrB with KD(M) values of 2.280E-5 and 3.189E-5, respectively (Figure 3(g)). And the inhibitory effect of IDAR against DNA gyrase activity was also determined by DNA motility assay. Figure 3(h) shows that the CIP (positive control) showed a significant inhibitory effect against the DNA gyrase at the concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. However, 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of IDAR was needed to reach the same inhibitory effect, which indicates the antimicrobial effects of IDAR probably mainly due to its disruption with the cell membrane.Figure 3.IDAR disrupted the cell membrane and interacted with the DNA Topo IIA subunits GyrA and GyrB.

Partial synergy effects were also observed with CIP, TEC, and GEN with FICIs of 0.75, an additive effect was observed with VAN with an FICI of 1 (Table 2). Due to the low MIC values after the combination of IDAR and FOS, FOS was selected for further research. The disc dilution method confirmed the synergistic effects between IDAR and FOS (Figure 4(a)). Using time-killing assay, we found that sub-MICs of IDAR or FOS showed no or only minimal bactericidal effects against MRSA; however, sub-MIC levels of IDAR could eradicate nearly 100% of live bacterial cells within 6 and 8\u00a0h when combined with 2 and 4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml FOS, respectively (Figure 4(c)). Similarly, by XTT assay, we found that FOS could also enhance the biofilm eradicating effects of IDAR (Figure 4(d)). CLSM images also demonstrated the synergistic antibiofilm effects of IDAR and FOS (Figure 4(e)). By fluorescence intensity analysis, a single dose of IDAR and FOS showed no effects on MRSA biofilms; however, in combination, the total MRSA biofilm biomass was significantly decreased (stained by SYTO9) and the proportion of dead cells was significantly increased (stained by PI) (Figure 4(e)).Figure 4.Synergistic effects between IDAR and FOS against MRSA planktonic cells and biofilms.

(e) Representative CLSM images of antibiofilm effects of IDAR and FOS alone or in combination.\n\n## AMI relieved the cytotoxicity of IDAR\nHemolytic tests were performed with horse RBCs, and we found that IDAR showed no hemolytic activity on RBC membranes below a concentration of 128\u00a0\u03bcg/ml indicating that there was no interaction between IDAR and the RBC cell membrane (Figure 5(a)). AMI is a kind of broad-spectrum cell protective agent, which showed no interaction with IDAR and no influence on its antimicrobial activity (Figure 5(b)). While IDAR inhibited the viability of the BEL-7404 (Figure 5(c)), HCoEpiC (Figure 5(d)) and HSF (Figure 5(e)) cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, with the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 6.43, 9.47, and 9.27\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively, the addition of 14\u00a0mM AMI significantly relieved its cytotoxicity and increased the IC50s to 13.35, 15.13, and 13.64\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively (Figure 5(f)). Similarly, FOS alone or in combination with IDAR + AMI showed no in vivo toxicity against the liver (Figure 5(g)), kidney (Figure 5(h)), or heart (Figure 5(i)) compared to the vehicle group.Figure 5.AMI relieved the cytotoxicity of IDAR in mammalian cells.

Then, the antimicrobial efficacy of IDAR alone or in combination with FOS was assessed by subcutaneously injecting one dose. We found that a single dose of IDAR (ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg/kg) could significantly inhibit abscess formation within 3\u00a0d after treatment in a dose-dependent manner. FOS also showed moderate MRSA abscess inhibitory effects. When FOS was combined with IDAR, the abscesses were significantly diminished. However, we could not judge the synergistic effects of the two drugs together because of the obvious efficacy of IDAR used alone (Figure 6(a)). A single dose of IDAR or FOS could not eradicate the bacteria in the abscess, as measured by bacterial cell counts on the first day after treatment, but there were significant synergistic antimicrobial effects between the two drugs, as demonstrated by the decreased bacterial load of 1.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 CFU/abscess. IDAR at 4 mg/kg began to show significant antimicrobial effects on d 2, and when combined with FOS, only 2 mg/kg of IDAR was needed to eradicate the bacterial load in the abscess. Furthermore, the bacterial eradicating effects were amplified on d 3, at which time, only a single dose of IDAR at 1 mg/kg showed significant eradication of the bacterial load in the abscess, and 2 mg/kg of IDAR could reduce the number of bacterial cells by 4.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.11 CFU/abscess (Figure 6(b)). In accordance with the description above, images showed that 2 mg/kg IDAR treatment had strong abscess inhibitory effects (Figure 6(c)).Figure 6.IDAR synergy with FOS eradicates MRSA in a subcutaneous abscess mouse model. Size (a) and bacterial load (b) of abscesses after treatment with IDAR (1\u20134 mg/kg, s.c.) in the presence/absence of FOS (20 mg/kg, s.c.) for 3\u00a0d. (c) Representative images of subcutaneous abscesses before and after IDAR treatment.Figure 7.Antimicrobial model of the mechanism of IDAR. Red lighting indicates the target of IDAR. IDAR penetrates the cell wall into the cell membrane, disrupts the normal structure of the phospholipid bilayer, and in addition, some IDAR penetrates the cytoplasm and interacts with the topoisomerase IIA subunits GyrA and GyrB, inhibiting DNA replication and cell growth and showing bactericidal effects.\n\n## Postantibiotic effects of IDAR against \nPAE and PAE-SME assays were performed to assess the postantibiotic effects of IDAR. The average PAE values for IDAR treatment of ATCC 43300 and ATCC 29213 were 6\u00a0h, while the PAE values were 3 and 4\u00a0h for VAN treatment, respectively. This indicates that IDAR had better postantibiotic effects than VAN against S. aureus compared to VAN. Similarly, sub-MIC levels (1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 \u00d7\u00a0MIC) of IDAR also exhibited better postantibiotic effects compared to VAN, with resulted in a longer period of time in which live bacteria could be recovered (Table 4).Table 4.PAEs of inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobial compounds tested in this study.StrainMIC (\u03bcg/ml)PAE (h)PAE-SME (VAN, h)PAE-SME (IDAR, h)VANIDAR1/2\u00d7\u00a0MIC1/4\u00d7\u00a0MIC1/8\u00d7\u00a0MIC1/2\u00d7\u00a0MIC1/4\u00d7\u00a0MIC1/8\u00d7\u00a0MICATCC43300436>1266>1287ATCC2921344610108>12>128\n\n## Discussion\nIn this article, the antitumor drug IDAR showed strong antimicrobial effects against both MRSA and S. epidermidis by targeting the cell membrane and the topoisomerase IIA subunits GyrA and GyrB (Figure 7). To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies reporting the mechanisms underlying the antibacterial effects of IDAR. Bacterial infection, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancies, is the most common complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia [36]. Because IDAR has both antimicrobial and anticancer effects, it may be suited for the treatment of hematologic patients with Staphylococcus sp. infections.\nIDAR shows signifi",
