  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntimicrobial drug resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest global health challenges of modern times due to its growing prevalence and the increased risk of mortality for those with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens [1]. The World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have also highlighted AMR as a global issue [2, 3]. Part of the challenge posed by increasing AMR in bacteria is the need for novel agents with alternative modes of action to effectively treat bacteria with AMR [4, 5].\nAnnually, over 2 million infections and approximately 23000 deaths in the USA are caused by antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and \nEnterobacter\n (ESKAPE) pathogen species [1]. Methicillin-resistant \nS. aureus\n (MRSA) was observed 1 year after the first clinical use of methicillin and genomic evidence suggests that resistance preceded the first clinical use of methicillin [6, 7]. Although current antibiotic classes have differing modes of action, some bacteria, such as \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n or P. aeruginosa, are resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics, diminishing their capability for effective treatment [1, 8]. There is increasing interest in the potential use of metal-based antimicrobial compounds for treating microbial infections as these have a distinct mode of action to conventional antibiotics and may have application in the treatment of recalcitrant microbial infections.\n\n## Mechanisms of AMR in bacteria\nThere are several mechanisms by which AMR is mediated in bacteria. Bacteria can promote the active efflux of antibiotics from the cell through the over-expression of efflux pumps or decrease the bacterial cell wall permeability to restrict antibiotic access to their target sites, ultimately reducing the concentration of the antibiotic within the cell and preventing its activity. Bacteria can also acquire alternative metabolic pathways to those inhibited by the drug, modify the antibiotic targets, or overproduce the target enzyme to circumvent the antibacterial activity of the drug. Finally, bacteria can degrade or modify the antibiotic via bacterial enzymes to inhibit its antibacterial activity [9\u201312]. Bacteria with AMR may possess one or more of these capabilities, depending on the extent of their resistance.\nThe formation of biofilms can also promote antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, if an antibiotic fails to fully penetrate the biofilm, it will not be able to target the microorganisms deep within the biofilm, leading to antibiotic resistance in these microorganisms [13].\nAMR is particularly problematic in infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria due to their intrinsic resistance [14]. The structural difference between components of the bacterial cell wall, such as the presence of the outer membrane, can prevent antibacterial agents from entering or remaining within the cell [15]. These intrinsically resistant Gram-negative bacteria can also acquire other resistance mechanisms by increasing the expression of efflux systems, modifying outer membrane proteins or modifying drug targets, increasing their resistance to many broad-spectrum antibiotics [16, 17].\nAn ideal novel antibacterial compound must be able to combat both the acquired and the intrinsic resistance mechanisms of bacteria. By developing novel compounds with unique modes of action that can bypass the resistance mechanisms in place, it is likely that bacteria resistant to conventional antibiotics can be effectively treated. With the lack of antibacterial drug compounds with novel classes and modes of action currently in development [18], there is a great need for an alternative approach to the development of antibiotic compounds. Metal-based antibacterial compounds have been proposed as a candidate for the development of a novel class of antibiotics for the effective treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\n## Metal-based antibacterial compounds\nIn the past, metal ions have commonly been used for antibacterial purposes [19]. At the beginning of the 20th century, an arsenic-containing compound named salvarsan was discovered and served as the first effective treatment of syphilis, a bacterial infection caused by \nTreponema pallidum\n subspecies \npallidum\n [20]. Antimony-based compounds have also been used as therapeutics for several centuries and pentavalent antimonials, or Sb(V), can be used for the treatment of leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite [21]. However, the discovery of penicillin and the antibiotics that followed caused a decline in the clinical use of metal-based antibacterial compounds. With the rise in AMR and the difficulties in producing antibiotics with novel modes of action, research into the use of metal-based pharmaceuticals as antibacterial agents has resurfaced.\nFor antibacterial purposes, metals can be complexed to a biomolecule, complexed to an antibiotic or used in conjunction with an antibiotic. As biomolecules are compounds commonly taken into a bacterial cell, complexing a metal with a biomolecule mediates entry of the metal into a certain area of the cell, to exert its antibacterial effect [22].\nAn advantage to the use of metal-based antibiotics is their diverse modes of action compared to conventional organic antibiotics [23]. Moreover, the addition of metals to organic antibiotics enables novel and additional modes of action compared to the organic drug alone [20]. Therefore, the use of these metal-based complexes alone or in combination with antibiotics holds promise as an effective treatment against resistant bacterial infections through these novel and additional modes of action.\nDespite a long history of use for their antibacterial properties, metal-based compounds currently have few antibacterial applications compared to the large number of publications discussing metal-based anti-cancer compounds. This limited number of publications may be partly due to fear over the toxicity of metals when administered systemically. However, some metals are essential for life in small quantities. Without these metals, most enzymes would be incapable of conducting the transformations necessary to mediate their biological functions [24].\nThe purpose of this review is to discuss the different metal-based compounds currently proposed in the literature as antibacterial agents for treatment of patients, especially those with antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. The main metals discussed in this review are silver, gold, gallium, copper and manganese. Although other metals have also demonstrated antibacterial activity (Table S1, available in the online version of this article), the metals mentioned above have been chosen as they show the most promising antibacterial activity and capability for safe topical or systemic administration as shown in the literature [25]. The strengths and limitations of each proposed antimicrobial metal are outlined to ultimately discuss if these metal-based compounds have the potential to be a solution for antibiotic resistance.\n\n## Silver\nSilver has an extensive history of antibacterial use. Herodotus noted the use of silver to carry water for Persian kings to keep the water fresh, particularly during military conflicts when fresh water from natural resources was scarce [19]. Avicenna described the use of silver filings in 980 C.E. as a blood purifier for heart-palpitations and offensive breath [26]. Colloidal silver was used in the 18th and 19th centuries as a wound antiseptic and silver nitrate for the treatment of burn wounds [19]. Silver nitrate was also used topically for the prevention of gonorrheal ophthalmia infections in newborns and was ingested for the treatment of stomach ulcers throughout the 1800s and into the 1940s [19, 27]. There is also a history of silver being used in coins and cutlery due to its antibacterial capabilities [28].\nCurrently, silver has many applications that make use of its antimicrobial properties. It is used in textiles and sprays to prevent the bad odours caused by sweat [28\u201330] and in cosmetics as an antimicrobial agent [31]. Silver is also a key component used in burn wound treatments [32]. An example is silver sulfadiazine, a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat burn wounds [33, 34]. Silver has also been proposed for use in medical instruments, dental instruments and implants for the prevention of infection [19, 35]. Currently, approximately 300 clinical trials examining silver-containing compounds for a range of different applications are ongoing or in the recruitment phase [36]. Although all of its current antimicrobial applications are for surface or topical use, they testify to the antimicrobial capabilities of silver and potential for its use as an antibacterial agent.\n\n## Antibacterial mode of action of silver\nAlthough inert in its metallic form, silver releases small amounts of ions in an aqueous environment, which have antibacterial action at the metal surface [28]. These silver ions can target bacterial DNA, proteins and membranes to exert their antibacterial effects. Silver may also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), although the literature is still unclear as silver is not redox-active [37].\nSilver ions bind nucleic acids strongly, preferentially binding bases and probably leading to DNA modification [37]. Silver ions have been shown to form homo-base pairs with an increased affinity to guanine, which may lead to pyrimidine dimerization. Silver ions have also been shown to interact with adenine at a high concentration [38]. Microscopy analysis conducted on silver-treated bacteria has identified DNA condensation in the centre of the cells. This DNA modification leaves the bacterium prone to mutation and inhibits replication [37].\nSilver ions have a strong affinity for sulfhydryl groups and will form an S-silver bond with them, leading to the inhibition of some bacterial proteins. These sulfhydryl groups belong to lateral chains of cysteine residues, which are often a ligand for a metal or cofactor in the metalloproteins involved in bacterial respiration, membrane structure, multiplication and metabolism [37, 39, 40]. Interference of silver ions with these cysteine residues can impair protein function, leading to bactericidal effects.\nObservation of silver-treated \nEscherichia coli\n via transmission electron microscopy identified morphological and structural changes as well as enhanced permeability in the bacterial cell envelope [41]. Similarly, an enlargement of the periplasmic space in \nEscherichia coli\n treated with silver suggested the inner membrane shrank and detached from the cell wall. Upon silver administration to \nS. aureus\n, similar morphological changes were observed but to a lesser extent, suggesting a stronger resistance to silver ions [42].\nThirty-four unique proteins were identified as targets of silver ions in \nEscherichia coli\n, many of which are involved in glycolysis and the TCA [43]. The inhibitory activity of Ag(I) ions was demonstrated through extensive biochemical analysis in conjunction with X-ray crystallography of Ag(I) ions coordinated to a cysteine active site, resulting in the identification of the first molecular targets of silver in bacteria [43]. Novel silver-based therapeutics can take advantage of this knowledge by targeting these metabolic pathways. However, as the binding sites for GAPDH are conserved between humans and bacteria, silver ions must be targeted towards only bacteria, for them to serve as safe and effective antibiotics [44].\nAn additional advantage to silver is that it has an oligodynamic effect, with high microbicidal capacity at very low concentrations of silver ions in water (1 p.p.m.) [45]. The dissolved oxygen in the blood can further the oxidation of silver metals, enhancing the formation of complexes between released silver ions and organic molecules and increasing its antibiotic action [28]. Therefore, silver has promising antibacterial activity and is likely to be an effective candidate for the development of metal-based antibacterial compounds.\n\n## Silver-based antibacterial compounds\nRecently, novel classes of silver complexes have gained attention due to their antibacterial properties, the most prominent being N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of Ag(I) [33, 46\u201348]. NHCs are strong nucleophiles that bind metals with high stability, leading to increased bioavailability of the metal in physiological conditions [46, 49]. Consequently, NHC complexes with Ag(I) are often investigated in the current literature to examine their antibacterial efficacy and patient toxicity.\nAn NHC-Ag(I) complex that shows promise for development into an intravenous antibiotic to be used against antibiotic-resistant bacteria is 1,3-dibenzyl-4,5-diphenyl-imidazol-2-ylidene Ag(I) acetate (SBC3) (Fig. 1) [50]. SBC3 has shown MIC values between 3.13 and 20 \u00b5g ml\u22121 against MRSA, \nSalmonella\n, \nEscherichia coli\n and \nP. aeruginosa\n [51]. In vivo studies conducted in Galleria mellonella larvae observed that SBC3 administered at a concentration of 25 \u00b5g ml\u22121 inhibited the growth of \nS. aureus\n by 71.2% [52]. G. mellonella are a common infection model for these studies as the insect bears significant functional and structural similarities to that of the mammalian innate immune system [53, 54]. The study also demonstrated that SBC3 administration to G. mellonella larvae did not increase the density of circulating haemocytes (immune cells), and thus it is likely that SBC3 did not boost the insect immune response [52]. This observation indicates that the survival of the larvae was due to the antimicrobial activity of SBC3 and not a non-specific immune response induced by the compound. Therefore, the antibacterial activity of SBC3 has been demonstrated against several bacterial species both in vitro and in vivo, making it a promising antibacterial agent for use against these bacteria, pending a greater understanding of its safety upon systemic or topical administration in humans.\nThe antibacterial efficacy of eight novel silver complexes, four triphenylphosphino (Ph3P)-Ag(I) benzoate complexes (2) to (5) and four NHC*-Ag(I) benzoate complexes (6) to (9) (Fig. 1) was assessed against \nE. coli\n and MRSA [55]. Both NHCs and phosphines can be used to increase the bioavailability of silver in physiological conditions for their use as antimicrobial agents [48, 56]. This study used Kirby\u2013Bauer disc diffusion testing to determine the antibacterial activity of the eight novel Ag(I) complexes against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.\nIn MRSA, the NHC*-Ag(I) benzoate complexes (7) and (9) showed the highest activity, with zone of clearance radii of 4.2 and 5 mm, respectively [55]. These values were comparable to that observed for the SBC3 control. In comparison, the most active Ph3P-Ag(I) benzoate complex, (5), had a zone of clearance radius of 4 mm. Although the activity of all compounds was lower than that of the antibiotic controls tetracycline and ciprofloxacin, the observed antibacterial activity of the NHC*-Ag(I) benzoate complexes in particular is high enough to warrant further research into their use as antibacterial agents.\nIn Gram-negative bacteria, NHC*-Ag(I) benzoate complexes also demonstrated higher activity than Ph3P-Ag(I) benzoate complexes. In Escherichia oli, the NHC*-Ag(I) benzoate complexes (6), (8) and (9) exhibited the greatest activity with zones of clearance radii of 5\u20136 mm. In comparison, SBC3 displayed a zone of clearance radius of 4 mm and the Ph3P-Ag(I) benzoate complexes demonstrated little to no inhibition [55]. The results of this study not only highlight the antibacterial activity of these novel NHC*-Ag(I) benzoate complexes, but also suggest that they may have higher antibacterial activity than those with phosphine ligands. This observation may provide insight into the further development of Ag(I)-based antibacterial complexes.\n\n## Systemic use of silver-based antibacterial compounds\nIn cases of clinical exposure to silver through ingestion, inhalation, dermal application, or haematogenous or urological entry, silver has shown low toxicity in humans with minimal risk [39]. Silver is absorbed into the body and enters the systemic circulation as a protein complex to be eliminated by the liver and kidneys. The metabolism of silver is modulated by its binding to metallothionines, which reduce its cellular toxicity and contribute to tissue repair [39]. Therefore, in low doses, silver does not have significant toxic side effects, as it is efficiently removed from the body. However, the toxicity of silver upon acute or chronic overexposure presents as a limitation to its potential for systemic use.\nAcute symptoms of overexposure to silver include diarrhoea, hypotension, stomach irritation and bradypnoea. Chronic ingestion or inhalation of common clinical silver preparations such as colloidal silver or silver nitrate can lead to silver metal or silver sulphide deposits in the skin (argyria), eye (argyosis) or other organs. Although not life threatening, these deposits are cosmetically undesirable [39, 57]. It is important to note that soluble silver compounds, such as those proposed as antibacterial agents, have greater potential to produce adverse effects in the human body because they are more readily absorbed than metallic or insoluble silver [58, 59].\nCurrently, silver-based FDA-approved drugs, such as silver sulfadiazine, are applied topically and not systemically [33, 34]. Due to the adverse effects of silver when administered systemically, silver-based compounds may only be safe for topical use. This limitation does reduce the applicability of silver-based antibacterial complexes, as they cannot be used for the treatment of systemic bacterial infections.\n\n## Gold\nThe earliest recorded medical use of gold was in 2500 B.C.E. by the Chinese. In 17th century Europe, gold was used in treatments for ailments such as fainting, fevers, melancholy and falling sickness. In the 19th century, sodium tetrachloroaurate [Na(AuCl4)] was used for the treatment of syphilis, the bacterial infection caused by \nTreponema pallidum\n subspecies \npallidum\n [60]. Interest in the antimicrobial action of gold complexes originated in 1890 from the work of Robert Koch, which described the use of a gold-containing compound, potassium dicyanidooaurate (I) (K[Au(CN)2]) against \nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n [61].\n\n## Antibacterial mode of action of gold\nGold is an attractive metal for biological and medicinal applications, particularly Au(I) and Au(III). Au(I) is selective for enzymes bearing sulfhydryl or selenol groups whereas Au(III) is isoelectronic to Pt(II) in cisplatin and may exhibit similar properties [62\u201365]. These traits of Au(I) and Au(III) have been exploited for their anti-cancer effects, but Au(I) and Au(III) may also have antibacterial effects.\nAlthough the exact antibacterial mode of action of gold is not fully understood, some studies have observed molecular targets that may be responsible [62]. Several studies strongly suggest that oxidative phosphorylation pathways in mitochondria are important intracellular targets of Au(I) and Au(III) [66, 67]. Moreover, a common mechanistic trait for the activity of Au(I) and Au(III) appears to be the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) [68]. Thioredoxin works with NADPH to form reduced disulfide bonds in cells among many other essential functions, such as DNA replication and responses against oxidative stress in some bacteria [69\u201373]. Consequently, strong inhibition of TrxR may lead to apoptosis of the bacterial cell [68].\n\n## Gold-based antibacterial compounds\nAuranofin is an Au(I)-phosphine derivative (Fig. 2), currently approved as an antirheumatic drug, that has shown promising antibacterial activity by targeting TrxR [26, 74]. Recently, auranofin has demonstrated antibacterial activity against drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, including \nS. aureus\n, MRSA, \nEnterococcus faecium\n, and \nEnterococcus faecalis\n, as well as \nM. tuberculosis\n (MIC=0.5 \u00b5g ml\u22121). Conversely, almost no activity was identified against A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa or \nK. pneumoniae\n (MIC\u226516 \u00b5g ml\u22121) [75]. This observed lack of antibacterial activity of auranofin against Gram-negative bacteria could be explained by the possibility that the glutathione system present in Gram-negative bacteria compensates for the lost reducing activity of TrxR caused by auranofin [76, 77]. Therefore, auranofin demonstrates promising antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria in the ESKAPE pathogen species as well as \nM. tuberculosis\n. As antibiotic-resistant strains of these pathogens have high rates of morbidity and mortality [1], the ability of auranofin to target and kill these bacteria is a great asset.\nThe in vivo antibacterial efficacy of auranofin has also been demonstrated in a murine systemic MRSA infection model [77]. Auranofin was orally administered to mice 1 h post-infection at a dosage of either 0.125 or 0.25 mg kg\u22121. It was observed that 80 % of mice receiving the higher dose of auranofin (0.25 mg kg\u22121) survived for 5 days, significantly larger than the survival of the vehicle control group [77]. These results demonstrate that auranofin has antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria MRSA in a murine systemic infection model, thus increasing its potential as an effective antibacterial agent in humans.\nTo improve the efficacy and therapeutic index of auranofin, 40 auranofin analogues were prepared and then tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [78]. The study identified six different compounds, (11) to (16), that exhibited favourable MIC and minimum bactericidal activities up to 65-fold higher than that of auranofin (Fig. 2). Compounds (13) to (16) possessed a broader spectrum of activity, with bactericidal effects against both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria \nS. aureus\n, \nA. baumannii\n, \nEnterobacter cloacae\n, \nEnterococcus faecium\n and \nEscherichia coli\n (Table S2) [78].\nThe development of bacterial resistance is also of large concern when investigating potential antibacterial agents such as auranofin. A recent study found no detectable resistance in an \nS. aureus\n strain after 25 days of auranofin exposure [79]. Auranofin has also demonstrated potent activity against the biofilms of \nEnterococcus faecalis\n and \nS. aureus\n, as well as a synergistic antibacterial effect with the antibiotics fosfomycin, linezolid and chloramphenicol both in vitro and in vivo [80]. The observed lack of detectable resistance, potent activity against biofilms and synergistic microbicidal effect with antibiotics reduce the likelihood for the development of bacterial resistance to auranofin.\nAlthough compounds containing phosphine ligands, such as auranofin, are the most studied in the medicinal applications of gold, interest is gaining in the stronger \u03c3-donating NHCs [65]. NHCs have more stable and versatile steric, electronic and physical properties with thermodynamically stronger bonds to the metal in comparison to phosphine ligands [81]. Therefore, NHCs have gained more attention in medicinal chemistry, including their use as ligands for gold-based antibacterial agents [82].\nSeveral proteins, enzymes and biochemical pathways have been identified as targets in the antibacterial mode of action of NHC-Au compounds. These targets include TrxR enzymes, G-quadruplexes, the zinc-finger enzyme PARP-1 and mitochondrial respiration [83\u201390]. The specific targets of each compound are dependent on the type of complex and nature of the coordinated NHC ligand. For instance, Au(III) complexes activate reduction through cellular sulfides [91], whereas Au(I)-containing cationic lipophilic complexes have enhanced effects against mitochondria [87]. Therefore, gold-based complexes with NHC ligands have similar antibacterial modes of action as gold, such as targeting TrxR and mitochondrial respiration, with slight differences in targets depending on the oxidation state of gold and nature of the NHC ligand.\nAntibacterial Au(I)-based metallodrugs with NHC ligands have only recently been reported in the literature [82]. The antibacterial activity of NHC-Au(I) complexes (17)\u2013(24) (Fig. 2) on several Gram-negative (\nA. baumannii\n, \nEnterobacter cloacae\n, \nEscherichia coli\n, \nK. pneumoniae\n, and \nP. aeruginosa\n) and Gram-positive (\nEnterococcus faecium\n and \nS. aureus\n) bacteria was compared to auranofin [92]. All complexes appeared to be highly effective against the Gram-positive strains of bacteria, with MIC values ranging from 0.64 to 12.51 \u00b5M, which were lower than those obtained for the control, auranofin. All complexes were effective inhibitors of bacterial TrxR, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 \u00b5M [92]. The results of this study support the potential for gold-based metallodrugs with NHC ligands as antibacterial agents against specifically Gram-positive bacteria.\n\n## Systemic used of gold-based antibacterial compounds\nAuranofin is currently FDA-approved for use as an antirheumatic drug and considered safe for systemic administration [75]. Although it demonstrates a low in vitro therapeutic index in eukaryotic cells, chronic exposure to auranofin over extended periods of time was found to be safe in patients with no cumulative toxicity observed over 5 years [93]. Auranofin has undergone clinical research for other applications as well, including a phase II clinical trial against chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (NCT01419691) [36]. Therefore, it is likely that auranofin could be administered as a systemic antibiotic to treat both acute and chronic bacterial infections without significant adverse effects. As auranofin is currently approved for clinical use as an antirheumatic drug, it is also likely that its approval for antibacterial uses could be accelerated compared to other proposed compounds.\n\n## Gallium\nThe antimicrobial properties of gallium were discovered almost a century ago for use against syphilis and trypanosomiasis [94], but until recently the discovery and use of conventional antibiotics left these observations overlooked. Gallium has been used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in clinical medicine for over three decades [95]. It was initially used in medical applications for the development of gallium-based radiopharmaceuticals to detect and monitor cancerous tissues. An example is radioactive 67Ga, used for the localization of malignant cells and inflammatory or infective foci [96\u201398]. Later, gallium uses were expanded to the development of gallium-based anticancer agents [99\u2013101].\nIn 1971, the first evidence of the anticancer properties of Ga(III) was presented [95] and gallium now follows platinum as the second most-used metal in cancer treatment [102, 103]. The anticancer activity of gallium is believed to occur due to its ability to limit the availability of iron to malignant cells by binding transferrin, a blood iron transporter [104, 105]. This action stimulates calcium efflux from the mitochondria, compromising mitochondrial function, and consequently initiating apoptosis [106]. As iron is also required for bacterial function, focus has recently started to shift to the antibacterial properties of gallium.\n\n## Antibacterial mode of action of gallium\nIron is required by both the mammalian host and bacteria, which leads to competition for iron during a bacterial infection [107]. Within a mammalian host, iron is sequestered for use in the metabolic processes associated with respiration, redox homeostasis, and DNA synthesis and repair [108, 109]. Iron is also made unattainable to pathogens as a protective strategy against infection [110]. Some bacteria, such as \nP. aeruginosa\n, circumvent this protective mechanism by possessing multiple iron uptake systems. Examples of these iron uptake systems in \nP. aeruginosa\n are the two siderophores, pyochelin and pyoverdine, with low and high affinities to iron respectively [111]. As bacterial iron uptake systems cannot differentiate between iron and gallium, bacteria can incorporate gallium into the cell instead of iron, causing detrimental effects [112].\nThe antibacterial activity of gallium compounds is related to their ability to act as an iron mimetic [113]. Ga(III) ions are similar to Fe(III) ions and can thus target the iron metabolism of bacteria by replacing Fe(III). Normally, ferric reductases within the bacterium reduce Fe(III) to the more soluble ferrous ion Fe(II) for incorporation into iron-dependent enzymes [114]. Ga(III) incorporated into iron-dependent enzymes cannot be reduced to Ga(II), inhibiting the enzyme. Interference with iron metabolism in bacteria has proven effective at diminishing infection rates [113, 115, 116] as iron is an essential micronutrient for the growth, survival and virulence of many bacteria but is not easily accessible in a mammalian host [117, 118]. Thus, the use of gallium-based compounds that interfere with bacterial iron metabolism may have promising antibacterial properties.\n\n## Gallium-based antibacterial compounds\nGallium nitrate [Ga(NO3)3] is a gallium-based complex (Fig. 3) that has recently shown promising activity against several bacterial species including \nP. aeruginosa\n and \nA. baumannii\n [119]. Gallium nitrate has proven effective at inhibiting the growth of clinical \nP. aeruginosa\n strains, including multidrug-resistant and cystic fibrosis (CF) isolates (IC90=1\u201340 \u00b5M). In a murine model of acute and chronic lung infections, gallium nitrate demonstrated a bactericidal effect, reducing lung injury and bacterial load [116]. Similarly, in \nA. baumannii\n, micromolar concentrations of gallium nitrate reduced bacterial growth in iron-poor media (IC90=2\u201380 \u00b5M) and in human serum (IC90=4\u201364 \u00b5M)",
