  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease, with approximately 1 million new cases and 30,000 deaths reported every year worldwide. Given the lack of adequate medication for treating leishmaniasis, drug repositioning is essential to save time and money when searching for new therapeutic approaches. This is particularly important given leishmaniasis's status as a neglected disease. Available treatments are still far from being fully effective for treating the different clinical forms of the disease. They are also administered parenterally, making it challenging to ensure complete treatment, and they are extremely toxic, in some cases, causing death. Triclabendazole (TCBZ) is a benzimidazole used to treat fasciolosis in adults and children. It presents a lower toxicity profile than amphotericin B (AmpB) and is administered orally, making it an attractive candidate for treating other parasitoses. The mechanism of action for TCBZ is not yet well understood, although microtubules or polyamines could potentially act as a pharmacological target. TCBZ has already shown antiproliferative activity against T. cruzi, T. brucei, and L. infantum. However, further investigations are still necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of action of TCBZ. METHODS: Cytotoxicity assay was performed by MTT assay. Cell inhibition (CI) values were obtained according to the equation CI = (O.D treatment x 100/O.D. negative control). For Infection evaluation, fixated cells were stained with Hoechst and read at Operetta High Content Imaging System (Perkin Elmer). For growth curves, cell culture absorbance was measured daily at 600 nm. For the synergism effect, Fractional Inhibitory Concentrations (FICs) were calculated for the IC50 of the drugs alone or combined. Mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm), cell cycle, and cell death analysis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid quantification were also determined by fluorimetry. Treated parasites morphology and ultrastructure were analyzed by electron microscopy. RESULTS: The selectivity index (SI = CC50/IC50) of TCBZ was comparable with AmpB in promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis. Evaluation of the cell cycle showed an increase of up to 13% of cells concentrated in S and G2, and morphological analysis with scanning electron microscopy showed a high frequency of dividing cells. The ultrastructural analysis demonstrated large cytoplasmic lipid accumulation, which could suggest alterations in lipid metabolism. Combined administration of TCBZ and AmpB demonstrated a synergistic effect in vitro against intracellular amastigote forms with cSFICs of 0.25. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that TCBZ has the advantage of being inexpensive and administrated orally, our results suggest that TCBZ, combined with AmpB, is a promising candidate for treating leishmaniasis with reduced toxicity.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nLeishmaniasis is a neglected disease caused by at least 18 protozoan species of the genus Leishmania, leading to up to 1 million cases per year worldwide (Burza et\u00a0al., 2018). The disease presents three clinical forms, including cutaneous and mucocutaneous forms, which can cause permanent skin scarring, and the visceral form, which leads to death in 90% of the cases if not treated, being the parasitic disease with the second highest mortality index (Pace, 2014).\nDespite being less severe than the visceral form, cutaneous leishmaniasis frequently leads to a large degree of psychological suffering, social stigma, and isolation due to the lesions, which, although usually self-healing, can be a source of secondary infections if left untreated (Pires et\u00a0al., 2019). Approximately 300,000 cases per year of cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous clinical forms in South America are caused by Leishmania amazonensis (Burza et\u00a0al., 2018).\nAvailable treatments of all clinical forms are toxic, expensive, and/or difficult to administrate and cause severe side effects. Meglumine antimoniate and amphotericin B (AmpB) are the most common treatments (first- and second-line drugs, respectively), and both require prolonged intravenous administration, making the patient less likely to comply with the treatment fully. In its liposomal formulation, AmpB has been indicated for patients after the failure of the first-line treatment, for those with severe disease, those presenting comorbidities or immunodeficiencies, and for pregnant women (Croft and Olliaro, 2011). Pentamidines, paromomycin and miltefosine (first orally administered drug for leishmaniasis) can also be used in endemic areas, despite also having a high level of toxicity and therapeutic failure (Santi and Murta, 2022).\nThe development of new drugs is a long and expensive process. Successful treatments should have a specific pathogen target in order to eliminate the pathogen without harming the host (Ioset et\u00a0al., 2009). Due to the high costs involved in treating parasitic diseases, they are often neglected by pharmaceutical companies.\nDrug repositioning is a quicker way of providing new compounds for a wide range of diseases for which no adequate treatment currently exists. These drugs have already been approved by US Food and Administration (FDA), saving a great amount of time and money, and their safety profile is well-known (Nosengo, 2016). A variety of repositioning drugs have been frequently reported for treating conditions, including bipolar disorder, migraines, type 2 diabetes and pulmonary hypertension (Alberca et\u00a0al., 2016). Also, tropical neglected diseases present a range of repurposed drugs either from other approved treatments or veterinary use such as eflornithine for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and albendazole for lymphatic filariasis (Klug et\u00a0al., 2016). Indeed, some drugs currently used for leishmaniasis treatment are repurposed, such as amphotericin B, paromomycin and miltefosine, originally used as antifungal, antibiotic and antineoplastic, respectively (Field et\u00a0al., 2017). In this context, it is important to highlight the benzimidazole family of drugs, which has not only demonstrated a satisfactory anti-parasitic effect but has also been shown to have good patient tolerability in a variety of benzimidazole derivates (Bansal and Silakari, 2012).\nOne member of the benzimidazole family is triclabendazole (6-chloro-5-(2,3-dichloro phenoxy)-2-(methylthio)-1H-benzimidazole) (TCBZ), a drug that has been used to treat fascioliasis in animals since the early 1980s and which was approved for adult use in the early 1990s. It was also approved for infantile fascioliasis (over six years) in 2019 (Terashima et\u00a0al., 2021). TCBZ has already demonstrated a bactericidal effect as a successful repurposed drug (Pi et\u00a0al., 2021), and antiproliferative in vitro activity against Trypanosoma cruzi (Alberca et\u00a0al., 2016). Further experiments have not yet been performed to investigate the drug\u2019s mechanism of action and its inhibitory effects on Leishmania spp.\nTCBZ\u2019s mechanism of action is still not properly understood, and it may target microtubules and/or protein synthesis (Robinson et\u00a0al., 2002). Still, it appears to be a very safe drug. TCBZ has shown a well-tolerability, with mild side effects such as biliary colic and abdominal pain, which is consistent with the expulsion of dead flukes parasites (Fasciola hepatica) (Gandhi et\u00a0al., 2019). TCBZ also has the advantage of being administered orally in one, two, or three doses, facilitating the continuation and conclusion of the patient\u2019s treatment (Terashima et\u00a0al., 2021). Studies have shown that TCBZ absorption after oral administration is fast, with t\nmax (time to reach the maximum serum concentration) of 2 to 3 hours (Gandhi et\u00a0al., 2019). In addition, treatment with liposomal AmpB costs over 1,200 USD for an individual weighing 70\u00a0kg (Datta et\u00a0al., 2020), while treatment with TCBZ costs 3 to 5 USD for the same individual.\nGiven the current availability of treatments for leishmaniasis and the importance of drug repositioning, especially for neglected tropical diseases, we tested the anti-Leishmania activity of TCBZ against the L. amazonensis strain alone and in combination with AmpB.\n\n## In silico study\nThe AmpB and TCZB structures were used to evaluate their theoretical physicochemical properties, whether PAINS are present, and the drug interaction prediction. The predictions were calculated using the swissADME web tool (http://www.swissadme.ch) considering Lipinski\u2019s rule of five (Ro5) (Lipinski, 2004) followed by the additional rule proposed by Veber (Veber et\u00a0al., 2002) and PAINS presence (Baell and Holloway, 2010). Drug interaction prediction was performed using the Drug Interaction Checker of DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/drug-interaction-checker).\n\n## Parasites\nLeishmania amazonensis (strain MHOM/BR/73/M2269) promastigotes were kept at 25\u00b0C in M199 medium added with 40 mM HEPES, 26 mM NaOH, 5 \u00b5g/mL of hemin supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco\u00ae). The parasites were cultivated for three days for logarithm growth stage parasite assays and seven days for stationary growth stage parasites assays.\n\n## Cytotoxicity assay\nCytotoxicity assay was performed as previously described (Ceole et\u00a0al., 2017). Cell viability was evaluated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Optical density (O.D.) was read in an ELISA plate reader (Biotek Model EL-800, VT, USA) at 570 nm. In order to calculate the 50% cytotoxic concentration index (CC50), THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202) cells were seeded in 96-well plates at density of 25x104 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 medium containing 50 ng/mL of PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) for 48h as previously described (Alc\u00e2ntara et\u00a0al., 2020). The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 to induce differentiation into adherent macrophages. After this, macrophages were incubated with increasing concentrations of TCBZ or AmpB for 48 or 72h in a CO2 incubator. Concentrations used for AmpB ranged from 0 to 10 \u03bcM (0, 0.009, 0.019, 0.039, 0.078, 0.156, 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 \u03bcM), while concentrations used for TCBZ ranged from 0 to 100 \u03bcM (0, 0.097, 0.195, 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcM). Then, 50 \u00b5L of MTT at 5 mg/mL was added per well, and the plates were incubated for 4h at 37\u00b0C. The plates had their medium removed, and 25 \u00b5L of 10% SDS solution in HCL was added for cell lysis. Subsequently, 50 \u00b5l of DMSO was added for the elution of formazan crystals. The colorimetric assay was read using optical density at 570 nm. Cell inhibition (CI) values were obtained from three experiments performed in triplicate according to the equation CI = (O.D treatment x 100/O.D. negative control) (Escobar et\u00a0al., 2010; Ceole et\u00a0al., 2017).\n\n## Infection evaluation\nInfection assays were performed as previously described (Alc\u00e2ntara et\u00a0al., 2020). Differentiated macrophages (25x104 cells/mL) were infected with metacyclic promastigotes (5 to 7-days-old metacyclic promastigote cells culture) at a ratio of 50:1 in RPMI media for 24h using 96 well-plates placed in a humidified incubator at 34\u00b0C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Previously to cells treatment, infection tests were made in three different time-points (24, 48 and 72h) for determination of higher infection index.\nFor cells treatment, increasing concentrations of AmpB and TCBZ were added to cell media and incubated for 48h at 34\u00b0C and 5% CO2 after infection. Concentrations used for AmpB ranged from 0 to 20 \u03bcM (0, 0.009, 0.019, 0.039, 0.078, 0.156, 0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 \u03bcM), while concentrations used for TCBZ ranged from 0 to 500 \u03bcM (0, 0.97, 1.95, 3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 \u03bcM). Plates were washed twice with PBS, and cells were fixated with 4% PFA for 20\u00a0min, washed twice with ultrapure H2O, stained with Hoechst for 20\u00a0min, and read at Operetta High Content Imaging System (Perkin Elmer). The number of intracellular amastigotes was evaluated to calculate half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50). Non-treated wells were considered as having 100% viability of amastigotes.\n\n## Antiparasitic evaluation\nGrowth curve was performed using three-day-old promastigote cells culture of L. amazonensis. Parasites were harvested and had their concentration adjusted to 1x106 parasites/mL and seeded in 24 well plates in 1.5 mL of M199 media. Non-treated parasites were used as control. Promastigotes were treated with increasing concentrations of AmpB (0.312, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 \u03bcM) or TCBZ (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcM) and maintained in a BOD incubator at 25\u00b0C for 72h. Plates had absorbance measured daily for drug effect analysis at 600 nm (Kar et\u00a0al., 2021).\nFor determination of promastigotes IC50, 3-day-old culture of promastigotes was seeded in 96 well plates at a concentration of 106 parasites/mL in the presence of AmpB (0, 0.019, 0.039, 0.078, 0.156, 0.312, 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 \u03bcM) or TCBZ (0, 0.097, 0.195, 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcM) in M199 media. Plates were maintained at 25\u00b0C for 72h. After incubation, promastigotes viability was accessed by MTT assay (as described at item 2c).\n\n## Synergism of TCBZ and AmpB\nInfected macrophages were treated with TCBZ and AmpB using a ratio of 10:1, 5:1, 2:1, and 1:1 in five serial dilutions (base 2) for 48h. The molar concentration for each ratio was designed as follows: 40 \u03bcM:4\u03bcM; 20\u03bcM:4 \u03bcM; 16\u03bcM:4\u03bcM and 4\u03bcM:4\u03bcM for TCBZ and AmpB respectively After the plates were analyzed using the Operetta CLS High Content Analysis System, Fractional Inhibitory Concentrations (FICs) were calculated for the IC50 of the drug alone and combined (Trinconi et\u00a0al., 2014; Kar et\u00a0al., 2021). Isobolograms were plotted using the sum of FICs (\u03a3FICs) of the ratio of each combined drug. The average of FICs sum of all ratios (\u03c7\u03a3FICs) was calculated and the combinatory effect was determined according to Odds (2003), where \u03c7\u03a3FICs \u2264 0,5 is synergic, \u03c7\u03a3FICs > 0,5< 4 is indifferent, and \u03c7\u03a3FICs > 4 is antagonist. The equation for the \u03a3FIC50 calculation is described below:\nTo the present, there is no gold standard method established to test antimicrobial synergism. Although the method used in this work can be limited to only testing antimicrobials for a fixed incubation time, it was used because it is a well-established method.\n\n## Flow cytometry\nLeishmania amazonensis (106 promastigotes/mL) were previously treated with TCBZ (IC50 for 72h). To assess the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), the promastigotes were washed with PBS and incubated for 15\u00a0min at 26\u00b0C with 5 \u03bcg/mL of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) and immediately evaluated in a flow cytometer. For cell cycle analysis, promastigotes were resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of PBS, to which the same volume of permeabilizing solution and DNA staining solution was added (3.4 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 0.1% NP-40; 700 U/mL free RNase A-DNase, 10 mM NaCl and 75 \u03bcM propidium iodide). A fluorescence reading was taken after an incubation period of 10\u00a0min at room temperature. To evaluate cell death, promastigotes were resuspended in annexin binding buffer (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.4) and labeled with Annexin V conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and 100 \u03bcg/mL of propidium iodide (PI). In all cases, events were read in a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton \u2013 Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 (Treestar Software, Ashland, OR, USA).\n\n## Reactive oxygen species\nROS quantification was performed as described by Bortoleti et\u00a0al. (Bortoleti BT da et\u00a0al., 2021). Promastigotes were cultured in 1 mL of M199 in presence of AmpB or TCBZ IC50 for 72h. In positive controls, 0.2 \u00b5L of 2 mM H2O2 was added to 1 mL of cell solution 60\u00a0min before withdrawing the treatment. The parasites were collected through centrifugation (2000 rpm for 7\u00a0min), the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 \u00b5L of M199. Parasites were plated in black 96-well plates (99 \u00b5L per well). An initial reading was performed to assess cellular autofluorescence in a fluorimeter (Ex 495; Em 520). Subsequently, 1 \u00b5L of the H2DCFDA solution was added (final concentration in the well of 20 \u00b5M). Plates were incubated for 1h in a 37\u00b0C incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2, and, after this time, the fluorescence was read in a fluorimeter.\n\n## Lipid quantification\nNeutral lipids were detected as described in Bortoleti et\u00a0al. (Bortoleti BT da et\u00a0al., 2021). Promastigote forms previously treated with TCBZ or AmpB (IC50) for 72h were collected and washed twice with PBS. After that, 199.5 \u00b5L of M199 and 0.5 \u00b5L of Nile Red solution (1 mg/mL) were added and incubated for 30\u00a0min in a BOD. Cells were rewashed and resuspended in 500 \u00b5L PBS. Then, the cell suspension was plated in black 96-well plates (100 \u00b5L per well), and the fluorescence reading was performed in a fluorimeter (Ex 530; Em 635).\n\n## Electron microscopy\nParasites were treated with TCBZ or AmpB (CI50) for 72h. The parasites were then harvested at a concentration of 1x106 parasites/mL, washed in PBS, and fixed with Karnovsky fixation solution (2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer) for 1h and washed with cacodylate buffer after incubation. Untreated parasites were also fixed and used as control. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cells were previously seeded in poly-L-lysin-coated coverslips. Cells were post-fixated with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1h in the dark and then dehydrated at growing ethanol concentrations (30 to 100%). Coverslips containing treated or untreated cells were submitted to critical point drying and then coated with a 20-nm-thick gold layer and observed under a JEOL JSM 6010 PLUS-LA (Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) scanning electron microscope. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), treated and untreated cells were post-fixated with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1h in the dark, dehydrated using growing concentrations of acetone (30 to 100%) and infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Poly/Bed 812 resin and polymerized for 72h at 60\u00b0C. Ultrathin sections were contrasted for 30\u00a0min with uranyl acetate and 2\u00a0min with lead citrate. The ultrathin sections were observed in a JEOL JEM-1400 Plus transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA, USA) using one or two-way ANOVA test followed by Dunnett\u2019s post-test. IC50 assay results were transformed in logarithm values and analyzed by dose-response inhibition (* p-value<0.04; ** p-value<0.009; *** p-value<0.0009; **** p-value<0.00009). Results were plotted, showing the standard error of the mean. All experiments were performed in biological triplicate.\n\n## In silico predictions for AmpB and TCBZ\nThe physicochemical proprieties of AmpB and TCBZ were assessed to compare their predicted oral bioavailability using Lipinski\u2019s and Veber\u2019s criteria (Veber et\u00a0al., 2002; Lipinski, 2004). As expected, AmpB presented higher violations than TCBZ (\nTable\u00a01\n). This is in line with the high level of toxicity that has been described for it, even when using the intravenous route (Laniado-Labor\u00edn and Cabrales-Vargas, 2009). AmpB and TCBZ chemical structures are represented in \nFigures\u00a01A, B\n, respectively.\nFor both drugs, pan assay interference compounds (PAINS) were not identified by the swissADME web tool (Daina et\u00a0al., 2017). PAINS are substructural features of chemical compounds that are often related to false-positive results in high-throughput screens because they tend to react nonspecifically with numerous biological targets rather than specifically affecting one desired target (Baell and Holloway, 2010). No drug interactions were found by the DrugBank tool for AmpB and TCBZ, suggesting that concomitant use of the drugs is safe.\n\n## TCBZ selectivity index is higher than AmpB for intracellular amastigotes\nTo evaluate the effects of TCBZ on parasite growth and determine which treatment time was the best for determining the effects of the drug on promastigote forms, parasites were seeded in 24-well plates, and their growth was estimated by absorbance for three consecutive days. AmpB was used as a comparative drug, as it is one of the most common drugs used to treat leishmaniasis worldwide. The results showed that AmpB affects L. amazonensis promastigote proliferation after 72h of treatment for all concentrations tested. On the other hand, TCBZ inhibited parasite growth at higher concentrations after 48h of treatment (\nFigure\u00a02\n). Thus, promastigote assays were subsequently conducted only at 72h since this time point showed a statistically significant effect for both drugs.\nThe IC50 of TCBZ and AmpB for promastigotes were determined after 72h of treatment by MTT assay. TCBZ IC50 was 6 \u00b5M, while AmpB IC50 was 0.06 \u00b5M (\nTable\u00a02\n).\nExploratory infection assays were performed for macrophages derived from THP-1 cells infected with intracellular amastigotes. Based on the results obtained (\nSupplementary Figure\u00a01\n), it was decided that 48h would be the most accurate time-point for amastigote forms, since it presented a higher infection rate then 72h. Although 24h showed similar results when compared to 48h, based on the lack of statistically significant activity of AmpB and TCBZ in promastigotes proliferation analysis (\nFigure\u00a02\n) this time-point was not considered for further evaluations. Infected macrophages were therefore treated for 48h with growing concentrations of AmpB and TCBZ, and the number of infected cells was analyzed using the Operetta High Content Imaging System. AmpB showed significant results at 5 \u00b5M and TCBZ at 3.1, 6.2, and 50 \u00b5M (\nFigure\u00a03\n). The number of total amastigotes was used to determine the IC50 for both AmpB (2.02 \u00b5M) and TCBZ (45.67 \u00b5M).\nHalf-minimal cytotoxicity concentrations (CC50) of TCBZ and AmpB were also determined by MTT assay in THP-1 derivate macrophages. Assays were conducted at 48 and 72h since these were the times evaluated in amastigote and promastigotes assays, respectively. TCBZ showed lower cytotoxicity than AmpB for both 48h (276.6 \u00b5M and 8.1 \u00b5M, respectively) and 72h (39.4 \u00b5M and 0.3 \u00b5M, respectively) (\nFigure\u00a04\n). The selectivity index (SI) was determinate using CC50 and IC50 of amastigote forms being 4 and 6 for AmpB and TCBZ , respectively (\nTable\u00a02\n).\n\n## Ultrastructural and morphological analysis of treated parasites\nTreated parasites (IC50 for 72h) were observed by electron microscopy to analyze ultrastructural (\nFigure\u00a05\n) and morphological (\nFigure\u00a06\n) alterations induced by TCBZ or AmpB. In L. amazonensis promastigotes treated with AmpB IC50, several cytoplasmatic electron-dense spherical bodies were observed, which probably contain lipids (\nFigure\u00a05B\n). TCBZ IC50 treated parasites showed the same cytoplasmatic electron-dense spherical bodies observed after AmpB treatment (white arrowheads), and other ultrastructural alterations such as vesicles at the flagellar pocket were also frequently noticed (black arrows, \nFigures\u00a05C, C\u2019\n). Infected cells were also treated with the highest statistically relevant concentration of TCBZ (50 \u03bcM for 48h) to assess the drug\u2019s effects. Although the same electron-dense structures seen in promastigotes were not observed, treated parasites showed intense vesiculation, a feature not seen in untreated parasites (\nFigure\u00a06B\n). Moreover, structures resembling cell debris inside the parasitophorous vacuole of treated samples were frequently observed in these cells (\nFigure\u00a06B-B\u2019\u2019\n, white arrowheads).\nThe morphology of treated promastigotes was observed by SEM. Untreated parasites were used as control and showed normal morphology (\nFigure\u00a07\n, row 1). AmpB-treated parasites showed morphological alterations such as shrinkage and roundness of the parasite cell body (\nFigure\u00a07\n, row 2, white arrowheads). Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes treated with TCBZ IC50 for 72h also showed morphological alterations like shrinkage and roundness in the parasite shape cell (\nFigure\u00a07\n, row 3, white arrowheads). Moreover, dividing cells were frequently observed, indicating a possible alteration in the cytokinesis process (\nFigure\u00a07\n, row 3, black arrows).\n\n## Cell cycle is affected by TCBZ treatment\nTo better understand TCBZ\u2019s mechanism of action, treated parasites were analyzed by flow cytometry for cell death, cell cycle, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Cell death analysis showed that treatment with AmpB increased the number of stained parasites using both Annexin V and PI (\nFigure\u00a08A\n). Untreated promastigotes showed 99.4% of living cells, 0.29% of apoptosis, 0.14% of necrosis, and 0.17% of late apoptosis. Similarly, TCBZ-treated parasites showed 99.4% of living cells, 0.3% of apoptosis, 0.1% of necrosis, and 0.2% of late apoptosis. On the other hand, AmpB-treated parasites showed 20.4% of living cells, 34.9% of apoptosis, 2.7% of necrosis, and 42% of late apoptosis.\nMitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated in treated promastigotes. Parasites treated with AmpB showed a clear loss of fluorescence when compared to controls (93%), while TCBZ-treated parasites showed a decrease of 50% in fluorescence (p = 0.07, \nFigure\u00a08B\n).\nThe cell cycle was analyzed with PI staining, and non-treated parasites were used as control. TCBZ-treated L. amazonensis promastigotes showed significant alterations in cell cycle phases, with a decrease in G1 from 74.6% to 54.3% and an increase in S and G2 from 9.7% to 16.6% and 11.9% to 25.4%, respectively (\nFigure\u00a08C\n).\n\n## ROS evaluation and lipid quantification\nROS were quantified to access cell death pathway. For this, promastigote forms were treated with IC50 of both drugs for 72h. Results showed that treated cells present a ROS profile that is similar to non-treated parasites, indicating that the anti-Leishmania effect of TCBZ may not be using the ROS production pathway (\nFigure\u00a09A\n).\nFurthermore, to verify if electron-dense vesicles observed by TEM could be filled with neutral lipids, this lipid class was quantified in promastigotes after 72h of treatment with IC50. We found a 69% tendency to increase the fluorescence intensity of parasites treated with TCZB compared to untreated promastigotes. However, no statistical difference was found (\nFigure\u00a09B\n).\n\n## Synergistic effect of TCBZ\nThe next step was to examine whether TCBZ and AmpB have a synergistic effect that lowers the IC50 of AmpB and, consequently, its toxicity, elevating the SI. In order to do this, combined proportions of 10:1, 5:1, 4:1, and 1:1 concentrations for TCBZ and AmpB were prepared, and infected macrophages were treated for 48h. These ratios were chosen based on the previous observations that TCBZ alone appears to have a comparable anti-Leishmania effect in doses 10x higher than AmpB. Also, as the IC50 of AmpB is around 2 \u03bcM, the focus of this assay was to evaluate if TCBZ was capable of lowering AmpB\u2019s IC50 through a synergistic effect. The results showed that at all ratios tested, the IC50 of the drug in combination ranged from three to 120 times lower than the drugs alone (\nTable\u00a03\n). Cytotoxicity assay was also performed in macrophages derived from THP-1 cells. For 1:1 ratio, CC50 was 29.34 \u03bcM for both drugs. For 1:4, 1:5 and 1:10 ratios, AmpB CC50 was 14.73, 27.77 and 34.16 \u03bcM, respectively, while TCBZ CC50 was 33.60, 36.14 and 21.55 \u03bcM, respectively. Regarding SI, AmpB and TCBZ presented the value of 77.2 for 1:1 ratio. For ratios of 1:4, 1:5 and 1:10, AmpB presented values of 39.8, 74.4 and 69.7, respectively, while TCBZ presented values of 46.6, 15.7 and 5.5, respectively.\nOnce the IC50 for each drug in each combination was determined, the \u03a3FICs equation (see item 2e) was used to calculate the average of the sum FICs (\u03c7\u03a3FICs). We found that the combination of TCBZ and AmpB resulted in a synergistic effect with a \u03c7\u03a3FICs of 0.25. According to Odds (2003), the drug combination is considered synergic when \u03c7\u03a3FICs \u2264 0.5. An isobologram plotted with every analyzed ratio also demonstrated FICs below the addictive line that represents theoretical addictive (or non-interactive) \u03c7\u03a3FICs 1 value, corroborating with \u03c7\u03a3FICs value found in this study (\nFigure\u00a010\n).\n\n## Discussion\nTreatment for leishmaniasis has changed very little since the early 90s. This is not because available treatments are highly efficient. Rather, it is probably due to a very low level of investment in this neglected disease. We are far from having a vaccine for leishmaniasis and lack a less toxic, cheaper, and more effective drug. Drug repositioning may potentially be used to save time and money in this situation. In this study, we present the results of a benzimidazole derivate that could be a prospective treatment for leishmaniasis. Firstly, promastigote growth was evaluated in the presence of TCBZ and AmpB for 72h in increasing drug concentrations to determine IC50. Intracellular amastigotes were treated for 48h for the same purpose. Regarding macrophage cytotoxicity, although tested concentrations were 10 times higher for TCBZ than for AmpB, CC50 values were comparable for both drugs. Furthermore, both drugs had similar SI for L. amazonensis amastigotes.\nUltrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy showed that treated parasites exhibited not only electron-dense structures compatible with lipid accumulation but also an alteration in flagellar pocket size, with the presence of small electron-dense vesicles. These alterations have already been shown in studies that tested possible sterol metabolism inhibitors in L. amazonensis, L. chagasi, and L. braziliensis (Rodrigues et\u00a0al., 2008; Oliveira et\u00a0al., 2009; Ceole et\u00a0al., 2017). The inference about electrodense structures can be explained by osmium tetroxide post-fixation, which has a high lipid affinity and corroborates with sterol biosynthesis target drugs (de Souza and Rodrigues, 2009). So far, the mechanism of action of benzimidazole derivate drugs has only shown microtubule and protein inhibition in a variety of parasites (Robinson et\u00a0al., 2002). To our knowledge, this is the first time TCBZ has shown any relation to lipid or sterol pathways.\nAlthough cellular death and mitochondrial membrane potential analysis did not show substantial results in TCBZ-treated promastigotes, the cell cycle showed significant modification, with an increase in the number of parasites in the S and G2 phases. Indeed, it has been shown that some drugs that target the sterol biosynthesis pathway can alter the cell cycle, probably due to changes in the availability of essential sterols (Oliveira et\u00a0al., 2009; Almeida-Souza et\u00a0al., 2016), in line with TEM results. Another possible explanation is that it is a consequence of alterations in cytoskeleton organization due to direct influence on microtubule polymerization (Robinson et\u00a0al., 2002) or nuclear membrane alteration, preventing complete cytokinesis (de Souza and Rodrigues, 2009). In addition, several cells in division were found in SEM when treated with TCBZ, in accordance with cell cycle results since cytokinesis appears to be affected. Nevertheless, the quantification of ROS and neutral lipids did not show significant results.\nWhen taken together, the results point to a possible anti-Leishmania effect of TCBZ, suggesting that this drug could be an interesting candidate to complement anti-leishmania therapy. Additionally, TCBZ may not only use microtubules as a pharmacological target but also interfere in lipid metabolism.\nSince TCBZ showed a possible anti-Leishmania effect, we hypothesized that this drug could have a synergistic effect when combined with the anti-Leishmania effect of AmpB. So far, one of the few compounds containing imidazole in its composition tested in combination with AmpB for leishmaniasis treatment did not have a synergistic statistically significant effect (Rodriguez et\u00a0al., 1995). However, because TCBZ has already shown successful repurposing as a bactericidal (Pi et\u00a0al., 2021) and as a fasciolosis treatment in sheep, when used combined with other drugs, even in resistant parasites (Tabari et\u00a0al., 2022), this specific combination may lead to desirable results. AmpB has already been used in successful treatments in combination with miltefosine, meglumine antimoniate, and pentamidine (Goswami et\u00a0al., 2020; Ramesh et\u00a0al., 2020; Vechi et\u00a0al., 2020). Indeed, we found that TCBZ and AmpB have synergic effects in vitro when administrated in combination, and no interaction between these two drugs was found by the DrugBank prediction in silico, indicating that it is safe to combine them.\nPatients often abandon treatment with AmpB due to its side effects and the fact that several trips to the hospital are required for parenteral administration (Neves et\u00a0al., 2011). However, other ways to administer AmpB, such as through aero",
