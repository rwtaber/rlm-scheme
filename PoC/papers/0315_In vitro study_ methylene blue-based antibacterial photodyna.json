  "title": "In vitro study: methylene blue-based antibacterial photodynamic inactivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",
  "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most antibiotic-resistant and opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised and debilitated patients. It is considered the cause of most severe skin infections and is frequently found in hospital burn units. Due to its high antibiotic resistance, eliminating P. aeruginosa from skin infections is quite challenging. Therefore, this study aims to assess the novel in vitro antibacterial activity of methylene blue using a 635-nm diode laser to determine the effective power and energy densities for inhibition of P. aeruginosa. The strain was treated with various concentrations of methylene blue and 635-nm diode laser at powers of 300 mW/cm2 and 250 mW/cm2. The diode laser's potency in the photo-destruction of methylene blue and its degradation through P. aeruginosa were also evaluated. Colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml, fluorescence spectroscopy, optical density, and confocal microscopy were used to measure the bacterial killing effect. As a result, the significant decrease of P. aeruginosa was 2.15-log10, 2.71-log10, and 3.48-log10 at 60, 75, and 90 J/cm2 after excitation of MB for 240, 300, and 360 s at a power of 250 mW/cm2, respectively. However, a maximum decrease in CFU was observed by 2.54-log10 at 72 J/cm2 and 4.32-log10 at 90 and 108 J/cm2 after 300 mW/cm2 of irradiation. Fluorescence images confirmed the elimination of bacteria and showed a high degree of photo-destruction compared to treatment with methylene blue and light alone. In conclusion, MB-induced aPDT demonstrated high efficacy, which could be a potential approach against drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern that contributes to the high risk of infectious diseases and mortalities and has a significant economic impact (Gajic et al. 2022). The extensive use of antimicrobials in both animals and humans, poor strategies for controlling hospital-acquired infections, and a lack of good decontamination and sanitization practices are some of the factors contributing to the rise in AMR in recent decades (\u00c1lvarez-Mart\u00ednez et al. 2020). Moreover, it is reported that antibiotic resistance in bacteria annually imputed about 700,000 mortalities. If preventive and control measures are not implemented, then by 2050, this figure might increase to 10 million deaths per year, with a 100 trillion USD loss to the global economy, which will significantly impact lower-middle-income countries (O'neill 2014; Christaki et al. 2020). The leading causes of severe infectious diseases and mortalities in immunocompromised debilitated elders are Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, and E. faecalis species (Murray et al. 2022).\nEspecially, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common opportunistic (gram-negative) pathogen widely distributed in every habitat and frequently linked to severe infections, whereas 10% of all infections acquired in hospitals are attributed to this pathogenic strain. P. aeruginosa inhabits moist areas and is thus present in many medical facilities, particularly in chronic wounds, nebulizers, or UTI devices, where the development of biofilms increases the risk of persistency and resistance to antimicrobial drugs (De Oliveira et al. 2020; Soonthornsit et al. 2023). The CDC has classified P. aeruginosa as a major concern for the last 10 years due to its contribution of approximately 32,600 morbidities and 2700 mortalities with 767 million USD in annual health expenses (Kunz Coyne et al. 2022). Several resistance strategies make P. aeruginosa a significant pathogen that is challenging to treat because it is resistant to numerous types of antimicrobial drugs (Pang et al. 2019). As a result of high resistance to antimicrobial drugs, there is an urgent need for the emergence of novel therapies.\nAntimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a potential alternative treatment for infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria resistant to antibiotics. In addition to being effective against a broad range of microorganisms, aPDT also has several advantages, including high selectivity with rapid action as compared to conventional antimicrobial drugs; resistance is improbable; it has the efficacy to eliminate biofilm; and it is relatively cost-effective (Rezaie et al. 2018; Lan et al. 2019; Negri et al. 2023). In aPDT, the ground-state non-toxic photosensitizer (PS) is activated by a specific range of light irradiation, which transfers energy to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and generates toxic singlet oxygen (1O2) that eliminates all drug-resistant bacteria by the oxidation process (Ishiwata et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2022). Many photosensitizers, including phenothiazines, curcumin, hematoporphyrin derivatives, phthalocyanine, xanthene, and chlorins, have been studied in recent years to improve the efficiency of aPDT (Figueiredo-godoi et al. 2022). Especially one of the most researched photosensitizers, methylene blue (MB), a cationic phenothiazine derivative readily accessible today, has a substantial absorption in red light at a wavelength between 600 and 700 nm which can penetrate in tissue from 0.5 to 1.5 cm absorption and can cause cell death, necrosis, or apoptosis in tissue. There have been a number of clinical experiments on in vitro and infected animal models that demonstrated the efficiency of MB against a broad range of microorganisms (Vecchio et al. 2015; Karner et al. 2020).\nIn this study, we investigated the efficiency of novel aPDT treatment by using a 635-nm red-spectrum diode laser in combination with various concentrations of methylene blue through the in vitro inactivation of multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa which are involved in severe wounds and skin infections. The potency of aPDT was recorded using CFU/ml, optical density, fluorescence spectroscopy, and confocal microscopic analysis. The efficacy of MB and diode laser alone has also been evaluated to demonstrate their solo antibacterial activity.\n\n## Materials\nMethylene blue (MB) photosensitizer in powder form was purchased from VWR International BVBA (Leuven, Belgium). In addition, Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA), nutrient broth, and nutrient agar powder were purchased from Oxoid Ltd. (Basingstoke, Hants, UK). The following classes of meropenem, gentamicin, fosfomycin, colistin, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, cefazolin, and nitrofurantoin antibiotic discs were purchased from Liofilchem\u00ae (S.r.I. Roseto, Italy). All other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA).\n\n## Bacterial growth and culture condition\nA gram-negative ATCC 27853 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was provided by the Applied, Environmental, and Geo-Microbiology Lab, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, and was used to check the in vitro efficiency of aPDT.\nFor reactivation, the strain was streaked from \u221280 \u00b0C stored glycerol stock on a nutrient agar-containing plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, the colony from the plate was inoculated into the nutrient broth and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C in a New Brunswick (INNOVA 43 USA) shaker at 144 rpm under aerobic conditions (Fig. S1 (i&ii)). An aliquot of 5 ml of an overnight incubated bacterial culture suspension was centrifuged (HERMLE Labortechnik Z 366 K, Germany) in a 15-ml tube at 5000 rpm for 10 min (15 \u00b0C). The supernatant was discarded, and the bacterial strain was washed three times with PBS and resuspended in sterile PBS. The strain concentration was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (LTECK Co., Ltd., INNO\u2122 & INNO-M\u2122, Korea) to the optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm. The adjusted bacterial cell to 108 CFU/ml (OD = 0.8) was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use for the in vitro experimentation.\n\n## Antibiotic sensitivity testing\nFrom the revived bacterial culture plate, 3\u20134 colonies were picked and transferred to 2 ml of (0.9%) normal saline to develop a visual turbidity equal to the 0.5 McFarland standard with a 108 CFU/ml concentration. The bacterial inoculum from normal saline was repeatedly spread on MHA with a sterile swab, while the disc diffusion method was used to confirm the antibacterial activity according to the standards of CLSI 2020 (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2020). The halos of inhibition were calculated in mm around the antibiotic disc after overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C.\n\n## Photosensitizer preparation\nThe powder form of methylene blue (VWR International BVBA, Leuven, Belgium) as a photosensitizer was used for the preparation of a 10 mg/ml stock solution, which was further diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and all experiments were run using concentration ranges of 500 \u03bcg/ml, 250 \u03bcg/ml, 125 \u03bcg/ml, 62.5 \u03bcg/ml, 31.25 \u03bcg/ml, and 15.625 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. S2). Until further use, all the concentrations were stored at 4 \u00b0C in the dark.\n\n## Light source for aPDT\nA diode laser of 635 nm developed by the National Institute of Laser and Optronics College of the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Islamabad (Fig. 2D), was utilized as a light source for aPDT against P. aeruginosa in combination with methylene blue.\nThe irradiation time was calculated by using Eqs. 1 and 2 (Parasuraman et al. 2020):1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\textrm{Fluence}\\ \\textrm{energy}\\ \\left(\\textrm{J}/{\\textrm{cm}}^2\\right)=\\textrm{Power}\\ \\textrm{density}\\ \\textrm{of}\\ \\left(\\textrm{PD}=\\textrm{W}/{\\textrm{cm}}^2\\right)\\times \\textrm{T}\\ \\left(\\textrm{seconds}\\right)$$\\end{document}FluenceenergyJ/cm2=PowerdensityofPD=W/cm2\u00d7Tseconds2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\textrm{Whereas}\\ \\textrm{Power}\\ \\textrm{density}\\ \\left(\\textrm{PD}\\right)=\\frac{\\textrm{output}\\ \\textrm{power}\\ \\left(\\textrm{mW}\\right)}{\\textrm{area}\\ \\left({\\textrm{cm}}^2\\right)}$$\\end{document}WhereasPowerdensityPD=outputpowermWareacm2\nThe device was used in this experiment in sterile conditions for photosensitization with output powers of 300 mW/cm2 in the energy 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108 J/cm2 and of 250 mW/cm2 in the energy 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 J/cm2 at wavelength of 635 nm for exposure time of 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 s. The diameter of the diode laser beam was 4 mm, and the distance was set between the laser\u2019s tip and the bottom of a 96-well plate at 5 cm. The optical power meter (1918-C Hand-Held Optical Meter, Newport, Irvine, California 92606) was employed to calibrate and measure the power of the diode laser in the whole experiment, positioned 2 cm apart from the glass plate\u2019s surface.\n\n## Methylene blue photobleaching\nA photobleaching experiment was performed using methylene blue to check the efficiency of the diode laser on dye degradation. A 200 \u03bcl of MB aliquot from each concentration was transferred into each well of a 96-well plate and exposed to a power of 300 mW/cm2. The degradation of methylene blue was visually observed and determined by the reduction in optical density measured by a microplate spectrophotometer (LTECK Co., Ltd., INNO\u2122 & INNO-M\u2122, Korea) at a wavelength of 600 nm. Three measurements were taken after each irradiation for the confirmation of data variation.\n\n## Biodegradation of methylene blue\nMethylene blue was employed to evaluate the tendency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for biodegradation at optimal temperature, condition, and incubation time. The bacterial strain was transferred to each 5-ml nutrient broth-containing test tube. In addition, 1 ml from each concentration of MB was mixed thoroughly in each test tube containing P. aeruginosa. After overnight incubation, the biodegradation was observed visually and compared with the control group.\n\n## Antibacterial effect of methylene blue without laser light\nThe inoculum of P. aeruginosa was incubated with each concentration of methylene blue for 20 min at room temperature in the dark to analyze the antibacterial activity of MB in the absence of photosensitization (+MB-L). Ten microliters of bacterial strain was spread on nutrient agar-containing plates, and growth was examined after overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C.\nThe well diffusion technique was also performed for the efficiency of MB without irradiation. Bacterial colonies were diluted in 0.9% normal saline to equal the turbidity with the 0.5 McFarland standard. Bacterial lawn was prepared on MHA surface plates by using a sterile cotton swab, and wells were made aseptically using borer tool on MHA. Ten microliters of MB from each concentration was transferred into each well, and after overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the inhibition halos were examined.\n\n## In vitro antibacterial photodynamic application on \nFor the in vitro aPDT of P. aeruginosa, the sample was divided into three corresponding groups: control/untreated (-MB-L), treated with laser without MB (-MB+L), and laser treated with MB (+MB+L). For laser irradiation without MB, a 100 \u03bcl aliquot was transferred directly into each well of a 96-well plate from a -20 \u00b0C stored bacterial strain in PBS suspension of the 0.5 McFarland standard (OD = 0.8, 108 CFU/ml). Also, for aPDT treatment with methylene blue, 100 \u03bcl/ml of MB from each concentration (500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, and 15.625 \u03bcg/ml) was mixed in 1 ml of bacterial suspension in Eppendorf tubes and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After incubation, all samples were irradiated with and without methylene blue except the control group in 96-well plate at power densities of 300 mW/cm2 and 250 mW/cm2 for the total energy densities 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, and 109 J/cm2 and 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 J/cm2 using a 635-nm diode laser for exposure of 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 s. After photosensitization, the bacterial samples were spread on nutrient agar aseptically and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, the colonies were counted using the gold standard colony forming unit (CFU/ml) technique (Eq. 3) (Manzoor et al. 2022) to confirm the viability of the bacteria.3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{\\textrm{CFU}}{\\textrm{ml}}=\\frac{\\textrm{number}\\ \\textrm{of}\\ \\textrm{colonies}\\times \\textrm{dilution}\\ \\textrm{factor}\\ \\textrm{in}\\ \\textrm{total}}{\\textrm{volume}\\ \\textrm{of}\\ \\textrm{culture}\\ \\textrm{plated}\\ }$$\\end{document}CFUml=numberofcolonies\u00d7dilutionfactorintotalvolumeofcultureplated\n\n## Optical density before and after aPDT treatment\nIt is common practice to determine the bacterial load in aqueous solutions using the optical density (OD) technique. However, the optical density (OD = 600 nm) of treated and untreated bacterial samples with aPDT at powers of 300 mW/cm2 and 250 mW/cm2 with MB concentrations for the selected exposure times and energy doses was measured by using a microplate spectrophotometer (INNOTM & INNO-MTM) at 600 nm. Each sample recorded three readings, and the average was used for the comparison research. Error bars have been added to the respective sections to highlight how the data varied from sample to sample.\n\n## Antibacterial PDT measurement with fluorescence spectroscopy\nThe FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Scientific, Jobin Yvon, Germany) was used to record the emission spectra between 285 and 525 nm with a 270-nm excitation wavelength, operating with FluorEssence\u2122 software version 3.5. The spectrometer incorporates a single position holder for sample measurement in a cuvette, a 150 W continuous wave (CW) Xenon discharge ozone-free arch lamp, and two monochromators for both emission and excitation sides. The increment resolution was reported at 1.00 nm, and the entrance and exit slit bandpass was reported at 5.00 nm. The fluorescence spectra of a 3-ml bacterial sample was acquired in a quartz cuvette with a 0.1-s integration time right after aPDT treatment at both power densities for the selected exposure time and dosages. Two spectra were recorded for each sample at each time.\n\n## Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis\nConfocal microscopic analysis was performed to evaluate the efficiency of MB-induced aPDT of P. aeruginosa by using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510, Germany). The bacterial samples were excited by the 488-nm argon laser of 30 mW and the 543-nm HeNe laser of 1 mW power in CLSM. Confocal fluorescence photographs were observed of treated and untreated bacteria with a plan-apochromatic objective lens at 100x/1.40 Oil DIC M27 magnification with a 1.61 \u03bcsec Pixel Dwell and 900-ms scan time. The bacterial strain was irradiated with a 635-nm diode laser at selected powers, energy densities, and exposure times. After irradiation, the strain was mounted on glass slides and incubated in the dark at room temperature for drying. The CLSM was applied after washing the glass slides with autoclaved PBS to remove unattached bacterial cells and cover them with coverslips.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nTreated and untreated groups were statistically analyzed using OriginLab and Microsoft Excel. All obtained results were compared with the control groups, and data taken in three readings were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Additionally, logarithmic values were assigned to data measured in colony-forming units.\n\n## Antibiotic resistance confirmation of \nThe diameter of ring-form inhibition zones was measured in mm using a digital Vernier caliper and compared to the values of CLSI 2020 standards (Fig. 1A, B). The clear inhibition zone around antibiotic discs represents bacterial susceptibility; the visible growth lawn and diameter of zones smaller than the standard reference values represent bacteria resistant to antibiotics. It is evident from Fig. 1 and Table 1 that P. aeruginosa is a multi-drug-resistant strain because it is resistant to four out of eight antibiotic classes and intermediate to a single one.Fig. 1Antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The photobleaching experiment in the lab showed a high degradation activity of all methylene blue concentrations after exposure to different light doses for selected time durations at 300 mW/cm2 power (Table 2). Methylene blue concentrations of 500 \u03bcg/ml, 250 \u03bcg/ml, and 125 \u03bcg/ml changed from dark blue to light blue by attaining 16%, 35%, and 51.5% degradation after 60, 120, and 180 s of exposure, while 79%, 87.6%, and 90.5% of degradation occurred after 240, 300, and 360 s of exposure. All the other concentrations were degraded entirely and converted to a completely transparent color due to the minimal concentrations of MB (Fig. 2A).\nTable 2635-nm diode laser set dosages for photodegradation of methylene blue at 300 mW/cm2Time60 s120 s180 s240 s300 s360 sEnergy18 J/cm236 J/cm254 J/cm272 J/cm290 J/cm2108 J/cm2Power300 mW/cm2s secondsFig. 2A Photobleaching of methylene blue concentration at a power of 300 mW/cm2 for selected irradiation times and dosages.

C Methylene blue degradation before and after incubation with P. aeruginosa.\nD 635-nm diode laser therapy system developed by NILOP and their application inside a biosafety cabinet. \u03bcg/ml indicates methylene blue concentrations\nThe absorbance reduction after irradiation also confirmed the degradation of methylene blue by using a microplate spectrophotometer (INNOTM & INNO-MTM) after exposure to a diode laser (Fig. 2B). So, the higher the concentration of dye, the more exposure time and energy density are required.\n\n## Methylene blue degradation using \nThe degradation of methylene blue before and after incubation with P. aeruginosa at temperature (37 \u00b0C) for overnight incubation and concentrations of MB are illustrated in Fig. 2C. A clear visual change in color from dark blue to transparent, compared with the control group, indicates that bacteria produced some chemicals and enzymes (Ikram et al. 2022) which cause the degradation of methylene blue. This demonstrates the potency of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with 90\u201399% of MB degradation. It is proved from the obtained results that methylene blue lost its potency as a photosensitizer after complete degradation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hence, the higher the dye concentration, the more incubation time is required for its complete degradation.\n\n## Efficiency of methylene blue in the dark and laser alone on bacterial growth\nTo study the antibacterial activity of methylene blue in the dark, all the concentrations of MB in the absence of laser irradiation (+MB-L) against P. aeruginosa were spread on nutrient agar plates and also on Mueller-Hinton agar through the well diffusion method. For overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, all plates were analyzed for bacterial load reduction.\nStill, according to Fig. 3A, no elimination was observed in viable bacterial growth on Petri plates, with no differences between the control and treated groups. Obviously, no clear zone of inhibition was observed on MHA through well diffusion except for the diffusion of methylene blue in wells and a clear bacterial lawn (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3A Antibacterial activity of methylene blue using 15.625 \u03bcg/ml, 31.25 \u03bcg/ml, 62.5 \u03bcg/ml, 125 \u03bcg/ml, 250 \u03bcg/ml, and 500 \u03bcg/ml concentrations in the absence of light on P. aeruginosa.\nB Application of MB alone in well diffusion method on MHA-containing plate. C Application of 635-nm diode laser without methylene blue against P. aeruginosa. s, seconds. \u03bcg/ml indicates methylene blue concentrations\nIn another experiment for the efficiency of laser irradiation without methylene blue (-MB+L), a 635-nm diode laser developed by NILOP was used on P. aeruginosa at 300 mW/cm2 power for time exposures at 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108 J/cm2 dosages. However, no reduction in bacterial load was observed, and the same number of viable colonies was present on Petri plates with no difference as compared with the control group (Fig. 3C). Hence, these results showed that methylene blue in the dark and light alone is ineffective on MDR P. aeruginosa and shows no antibacterial activity.\n\n## Photodynamic inactivation of \nSynergistically, methylene blue with a 635-nm diode laser system (+MB+L) was employed for the inactivation of P. aeruginosa. Consequently, a significant reduction in bacterial growth was confirmed under the S/ST Stereo Microscope (Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong) (Fig. 4A). Indeed, the results were investigated by the standard gold method of colony-forming units (CFU/ml) before and after treatment, and the reduction in the viability of bacterial growth was compared with the control groups.Fig. 4A\nP. aeruginosa colonies clearly seen under S/ST Stereo Microscope before and after treatment with MB and diode laser.

The standard errors are very low and are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of each independent sample, which also demonstrates the logarithmic values in log10 CFU/ml reduction. s, seconds. \u03bcg/ml indicates methylene blue concentrations\nFor in vitro inactivation of P. aeruginosa, various concentrations of methylene blue from 15.625 to 500 \u03bcg/ml were used in conjugation with a 635-nm diode laser and illuminated in 96-well plate at both power densities for exposures of 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 300 s and energy densities of 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108 J/cm2 (300 mW/cm2) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 J/cm2 (250 mW/cm2). As a result, a significant reduction in viable bacterial growth was observed compared to the treatment with methylene blue in the dark, diode laser alone, and control groups. All the results were calculated as a log10 CFU/ml reduction (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5).Fig. 5A Photographs of P. aeruginosa colonies on nutrient agar plates after treatment with various concentrations of methylene blue in combination with 635-nm diode laser at a power of 250 mW/cm2 for exposures of 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 s and 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108 J/cm2 of dosages.

The standard errors are very low and are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of each independent sample, which also demonstrates the logarithmic values in log10 CFU/ml reduction. s, seconds. \u03bcg/ml indicates methylene blue concentrations\nIn the case of photoinactivation at 300 mW/cm2, bacterial viability was reduced by 39.8%, 54.8%, 66.4%, 78.4%, 89%, and 94.2% (0.22 to 1.24 log10 reduction in CFU/ml) at 15.625 \u03bcg/ml, 31.25 \u03bcg/ml, 62.5 \u03bcg/ml, 125 \u03bcg/ml, 250 \u03bcg/ml, and 500 \u03bcg/ml MB concentrations after exposure for 60 s at energy density of 18 J/cm2 (Fig. 4C, D).\nWhile as the exposure time for treatment and energy density increased, the viability was reduced, respectively, from 48.7 to 97.5% (0.28 to 1.60 log10) for 120 s at 36 J/cm2, 56.9 to 98.8% (0.36 to 1.94 log10) for 180 s at 54 J/cm2, 63 to 99.7% (0.43 to 2.54 log10) for 240 s at 72 J/cm2, and from 76.1 to 99.99% (0.62 to 4.32 log10 reduction in CFU/ml) for 300 s at 90 J/cm2. Moreover, aPDT at 108 J/cm2 for 360 s of exposure, the bacterial growth was reduced by 83.5%, 94.4%, 97.8%, 99.7%, 99.99%, and 99.99%, with a 0.78 to 4.32 log10 reduction in CFU/ml (Fig. 4B\u2013D). According to Fig. 4B, the same number of colonies was inhibited by MB-mediated aPDT at 250 \u03bcg/ml and 500 \u03bcg/ml MB concentrations for 360 s of exposure at energy of 108 J/cm2, while also after treatment for 300 s at 500 \u03bcg/ml (90 J/cm2).\nOn the other hand, it is evident that a reduction from 0.04 to 3.48 log10 in CFU/ml of P. aeruginosa was observed with the treatment at a power of 250 mW/cm2 as compared to the control group and treatment with MB in the dark and laser alone (Fig. 5A\u2013C).\nAs displayed in the plate photographs in Fig. 5A, the bacterial colonies decreased by 10.6%, 27.2%, 52.6%, 75.8%, 87%, and 93.1%, with a reduction from 0.04 to 1.16 log10 in CFU/ml at MB concentrations of 15.625 \u03bcg/ml, 31.25 \u03bcg/ml, 62.5 \u03bcg/ml, 125 \u03bcg/ml, 250 \u03bcg/ml, and 500 \u03bcg/ml after 60 s of exposure at 15 J/cm2 density of energy (Fig. 5B, C), while the killing rate of colonies increased from 30.3 to 97.1% (0.15\u20131.54 log10 reduction in CFU/ml) after 120 s at 30 J/cm2, 45.9 to 98.5% (0.26\u20131.84 log10) after 180 s at 45 J/cm2, 61.5 to 99.3% (0.41\u20132.15 log10) after 240 s at 60 J/cm2, and 69.8 to 99.8% (0.52\u20132.71 log10) after 300 s at 75 J/cm2 as a consequence of the rise in the time exposure to irradiation and density of energy.\nIn addition, the increased inhibition impact was reported by 80.7%, 91%, 95.5%, 99.2%, 99.8%, and 99.97%, with a reduction in CFU/ml from 0.71 to 3.48 log10 at 90 J/cm2 after irradiation exposure for 360 s (Fig. 5A\u2013C). However, when P. aeruginosa was treated with MB-based aPDT at a power of 300 mW/cm2, it showed the maximum reduction in comparison treatment at a power of 250 mW/cm2 (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). The data indicated that P. aeruginosa is more susceptible to 300 mW/cm2 at 90 and 108 J/cm2 for 240, 300, and 360 s of exposure than 250 mW/cm2 laser power.\n\n## Optical density-based analysis\nThe measurement of OD is a rapid, cheap, and frequently used technique for determining the quantity of viable bacterial cells in the aqueous solution at the 600-nm wavelength; at this wavelength, the light scatters and measures the turbidity in the solution, which indicates the increase and decrease in the level of bacteria (Beal et al. 2020; Imtiaz et al. 2023). Figure 6A and B demonstrate the optical density of P. aeruginosa, measured at 600 nm before and after treatment with various concentrations of methylene blue and a 635-nm diode laser.Fig. 6Optical density of P. aeruginosa was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm before and after treatment with aPDT at powers A 300 mW/cm2 and B 250 mW/cm2. The standard errors are very low and are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation of each independent sample. \u03bcg/ml indicates methylene blue concentrations\nAs the irradiation time and dosages increase, the solution turbidity and OD gradually decrease compared to the control group which indicates the highest level of bacterial growth. After 360 s of exposure and irradiation with powers of 360 mW/cm2 (108 J/cm2) and 250 mW/cm2 (90 J/cm2), in the last sample, complete transparency was observed. The obtained results of optical densities as shown in Fig. 6A and B correlate with Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, which illustrate a maximum decrease in bacterial colonies on nutrient agar plates after aPDT treatment.\n\n## Fluorescence spectroscopy for the study of \nFigure 7A and B demonstrate the fluorescence spectroscopy of P. aeruginosa before and after aPDT treatment at powers of 300 mW/cm2 and 250 mW/cm2 for selected time exposures and laser dosages. Fluorescence spectroscopy is an advanced, fast, and authentic technique for detecting viable bacteria in aqueous solutions through monitoring the fluorophores in microorganisms (Ammor 2007). The fluorescence emission spectra of bacteria were recorded between 285 and 525 nm, with excitation at 270 nm. Figure 7A and B show the broad spectral peak at 336 nm, which represents the signature for tryptophane molecules, that was later blue shifted from 336 to 309 nm after treatment towards the left side. Consequently, after the elimination of bacterial viability and degradation of methylene blue, a new spectral peak appeared after 120 s of exposure (30 J/cm2 and 36 J/cm2) at 300 nm, which indicates the water Raman scattering (Imtiaz et al. 2023). A variation in the reduction of bacteria after treatment with both power densities compared to the control group was also observed and was confirmed by colony-forming unit per milliliter and optical density (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Fig. 6). Tryptophane is a highly fluorescent amino acid or fluorophore that indicates bacterial viability in aqueous solutions, which show emission spectra from 305 to 400 nm with excitation at 270 nm (Ammor 2007",
