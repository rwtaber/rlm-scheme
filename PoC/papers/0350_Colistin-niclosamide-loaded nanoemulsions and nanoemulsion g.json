  "full_text": "## Introduction\nCurrently, the emergence and prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR) Gram-negative bacteria pose significant challenges to the treatment of clinical infections (1\u20133). The emergence and spread of MDR Gram-negative bacteria represent a threat to human and animal health (4). Salmonella is an important zoonotic pathogen with the highest incidence of Salmonella infection, causing considerable economic losses due to the culling and replacing of infected flocks and unbearably high treatment costs to poultry farmers (5, 6). Colistin (COL), a non-ribosomal peptide antibiotic, is often regarded as a last-resort option against MDR Gram-negative bacteria. However, the appearance of mcr-1 and its mutants seriously threatens the clinical therapeutic efficacy of colistin (7, 8). The widespread dispersion of plasmid-mediated mcr resistance gene in swine, poultry, cattle, and sheep poses a challenge to the last line of defense, which could pose a serious threat to public health (9\u201311). Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover new and effective antimicrobial therapeutic strategies.\nCombining existing antibiotics with adjuvants offers a promising strategy for the effectiveness in treating MDR bacterial infections (12). There are many kinds of COL adjuvants reported, for example, natural extract nordihydroguaiaretic acid and tetrandrine (13, 14), Gram-positive antibiotics clarithromycin and rifampicin (15), and anti-parasitical medicine oxyclozanide and closantel (16, 17). Despite these ongoing efforts, no COL adjuvant has been applied in human medicine or veterinary clinical practice so far, due to practical and technical limitations.\nNiclosamide (NIC) is an FDA-approved anthelmintic drug widely used for treating tapeworm infection in humans and has lately been shown to treat viral diseases such as COVID-19 and possess anti-diabetic activities (18, 19). In addition, a previous study demonstrated that NIC can reverse COL resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae (17, 20, 21). However, NIC belongs to class II, according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), which is indicative of poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and dissolution rate-limited absorption (22). Due to this limitation, its combination with COL directly affects the clinical therapeutic effect. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a drug delivery system capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic COL and hydrophobic NIC to achieve synergistic antibacterial activity.\nNanotechnology is an emerging and rapidly evolving technology that offers possibilities for diverse applications (23). Nanoemulsions (NEs), a droplet size of 10 to 100\u2009nm, are generally made up of an oil, surfactant, co-surfactant, and water (24). These nanoemulsion systems offer prospective carriers for improving the dissolution of poorly soluble drugs that have a higher drug load capacity, better visual transparency, and better performance (24, 25). Higher stability and better solubility of solutes are also characteristics of nanoemulsions, and the drugs may be loaded in the internal phase or distributed in the external phase of nanoemulsions (26). Nanoemulsion gel is a drug delivery system that combines nanoemulsions with gel matrices to create a sustained-release function. Nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels are two types of nanocarriers that have been shown to enhance drug efficacy (27).\nIn this study, the nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels co-loaded with NIC and COL were prepared to reverse COL resistance. First, we evaluated the synergistic antibacterial activity of NIC and COL. Then, we developed a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) to serve as a vehicle for delivering COL and NIC concurrently. The particle size, stability, and release characteristics of COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs were thoroughly evaluated, while their antibacterial activity and underlying mechanism were meticulously probed in vitro. Finally, the in vivo therapeutic effect of the drug delivery system on COL-resistant Salmonella infections was studied using a mouse intraperitoneal infection model.\n\n## Materials\nColistin (88%) was purchased from Hebei Shengxue Dacheng bio-pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Hebei, China), niclosamide (98%), cremophor EL (EL), ethyl oleate (EO), isopropyl myristate (IPM), Tween-80, Tween-20, and Poloxamer 188 were commercially available from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Poloxamer 407 (P407) was purchased from Accela ChemBio Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Castor oil, octyl phenol, and polyoxyethylene ether-10 (OP) were purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Biochemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Cremophor RH-40 was provided by Jiangsu Haian Petrochemical Plant (Jiangsu, China). Isopropanol, ethanol, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. Ten non-duplicate clinical COL-resistant Salmonella strains were isolated from swine, chickens, and humans, specifically and preserved in the Laboratory of Pharmacology, Henan Agricultural University.\n\n## Antibacterial activity of the drug combination characterized using the checkerboard assay\nThe checkerboard assays were conducted to explore the synergistic activity between COL and NIC by determining the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) (14). Briefly, COL was continuously diluted 2-fold along row by row, while NIC was continuously diluted 2-fold along the column by column to establish a matrix in 96-well plates, where each well contained different concentrations of two drugs. The bacterial suspension (100\u2009\u03bcL) was added to each well to reach an ultimate bacterial concentration of approximately 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL. The 96-well plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18\u2009h and examined for visible turbidity.\nThe FICI was calculated according to the following formula:\nFICI=FICIA\u2009+\u2009FICIB\u2009=\u2009(MICA in combination/MICA alone)\u2009+\u2009(MICB in combination/MICB alone).\nFICI was interpreted as follows: FICI \u22640.5 (synergy), 0.5\u2009<\u2009FICI \u22641 (additive effect), 1\u2009<\u2009FICI\u22642 (irrelevance), FICI >2 (antagonism) (28).\n\n## Screening of nanoemulsion components by solubility assessment\nThe solubility of NIC in a range of oils (EO, IPM, and castor oil), surfactants (RH-40, EL, OP, Tween-80, and Tween-20), and co-surfactants (ethanol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, and PEG400) were screened for the development of nanoemulsion. An excess amount of NIC was added to a clean glass vial with 1\u2009mL of each oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant and vortexed for 30\u2009s (25). Then, the sample was mechanically shaken in a water bath shaker at 37\u00b0C for 72\u2009h to reach equilibrium (29). The equilibrated samples were centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 15\u2009min. The amount of soluble NIC of each sample was determined using an HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) method and UV\u2013vis spectroscopy as described below. The oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants with the highest NIC solubility were selected as the components of nanoemulsions. All excipients used in this study are injectable and comply with an FDA approval.\n\n## Construction of pseudo-ternary phase diagram\nNanoemulsion was prepared by low energy (spontaneous) emulsification method. Based on the solubility results above, the selection was made for oil, surfactants, and co-surfactants to construct a pseudo-ternary phase diagram using the water titration method at room temperature. The specific experimental steps are as follows: first, the effect of surfactants on the formation of nanoemulsion was observed. Co-surfactant (ethyl alcohol) is separately mixed with surfactant (EL, Tween-20, and OP) to form a surfactant/co-surfactant mixture (Smix), and the Smix ratio is 3:1. Pseudo-ternary phase diagram was constructed with different ratios of oil to Smix (1:9, 2:8, 3:7, 4:6, 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, 8:2, 9:1) with EO as an oil phase. Similarly, the effects of different co-surfactants on the formation of nanoemulsion were analyzed. Then, EL was used as the surfactant, and it was mixed with ethyl alcohol at different Smix (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 3:2) with EO as the oil phase to determine the maximum microemulsion region from four different ratios of Smix. Then, these samples were checked for transparency and uniformity after the gradual addition of water (30).\n\n## Preparation and optimization of COL/NIC-NEs\nThe microemulsion technique was optimized to produce blank nanoemulsions by adjusting the ratio of EO (oil phase), EL (surfactant), and ethyl alcohol (co-surfactant). The optimization process was guided by particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) as key indicators. Six different blank nanoemulsions (NE1 to NE6) were prepared (Supplementary Table S1). Particle size and PDI were measured by zeta-sizer Nano (ZS-90, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Using the optimized conditions of NE6, COL/NIC-NEs were prepared based on blank nanoemulsion formulations. Briefly, NIC (0.2% w/w) dissolved in EO (5%) was added to Smix (45% w/w) consisting of EL/ethyl alcohol (3:1) and stirred using a magnetic stirrer for 5\u2009min. Finally, 5\u2009mL of deionized water containing (0.4%) COL was added slowly with stirring to obtain a clear solution. A schematic diagram for the fabrication of COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs is shown in Figure 1A.\n\n## Droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential analysis\nThe particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential were measured using Zeta-sizer Nano ZS-90 (Malvern Instruments, MAL, United Kingdom). Each measurement (100 runs) was performed in triplicate at 25\u00b0C and an equilibration time of 60\u2009s.\n\n## Morphology observation\nThe morphological characteristics and structure of the provided COL/NIC-NEs were observed using TEM (transmission electron microscope) (31). COL/NIC-NEs were diluted with deionized water (1:100). Appropriate samples were placed on a carbon-coated copper grid and dried at 25\u00b0C for 10\u2009min, then negatively stained with 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid solution, and finally observed under TEM at 120\u2009kV (TEM, Czech, Tecnai G2 Spirit Bio).\n\n## Stability study\nFor the research of new drug dosage forms, the stability of nanoemulsion would be one of the most important properties. Here, the stability of the COL/NIC-NEs was evaluated by centrifugal tests, temperature factors, and preliminary stability for 3-month storage. At the same time, the particle size and PDI of the COL/NIC-NEs were measured before and after centrifugation.\n\n## Incorporation of nanoemulsion into gels\nThe incorporation of nanoemulsion into a mixture of 30% P407 and 8% P188 was carried out by first preparing the poloxamer gel base. To do this, 30% P407 and 8% P188 powder were added to distilled water while stirring at a low speed. The mixture was then allowed to hydrate for 10\u2009min before increasing the stirring speed too high for an additional 30\u2009min to ensure proper gel formation. The prepared nanoemulsion was then added to the poloxamer gel at a concentration of 50% (v/v) and mixed until a homogenous gel was formed. We then allowed the mixture to sit for 24\u2009h to allow for proper hydration and formation of the gel. Finally, we checked the gelation temperature and pH of the final product to ensure it met the desired specifications.\n\n## Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) radiation measurements\nFourier transform infrared spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Nicolet, iS20 FTIR, USA) was performed to check the chemical composition of the formulation. The specific parameters are based on previous studies (25). The measurement range is 350 to 4,000 wave numbers, the data interval is 0.5\u2009cm\u22121, and the resolution is 2\u2009cm\u22121. The figure is expressed as a relation between relative transmittance (%) and wave number (cm\u22121).\n\n## Determination of niclosamide and colistin\nA high-performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technology Co., Ltd) was used to detect the content of NIC according to the previously described method (32). NIC was separated by an Agilent TC-C18 column (5\u2009mm, 4.6\u2009mm\u2013250\u2009mm) guarded with a precolumn at 30\u00b0C and detected at 330\u2009nm. The injection volume was set to 20\u2009\u03bcL. The mobile phase consisted of 85% methanol and 15% water (containing 0.1% formic acid) pumped at a flow rate of 1.0\u2009mL/min. An NIC stock solution was prepared in methanol (1\u2009mg/mL) and sequentially diluted with methanol to 100, 80, 60, 40, and 20\u2009\u03bcg/mL. A standard curve was established, and the content was calculated using the peak area of the sample at the retention time (6.8\u2009min).\nCOL content was determined using UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. COL solution (1\u2009mg/mL in acetonitrile) was diluted with distilled water to 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 1, 0.5, and 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL, and the absorption of the sample at 230\u2009nm was determined using a UV\u2013vis spectrometer. A standard curve was established, and the content was calculated using the absorption value of the sample.\n\nIn vitro release studies of COL and NIC from COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs were carried out at 37\u00b0C via dialysis as previously described (33). The COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs (1\u2009mL) were transferred to dialysis bags (10\u2009kDa MWCO), respectively, and then immersed in 20\u2009mL of PBS (pH 7.4) and kept in a shaking water bath at 37\u00b0C and 100\u2009rpm. At a predetermined time (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96\u2009h), the 0.5\u2009mL COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs in the dialysis bag was taken out and refilled with PBS of equal volume after each sampling. The accumulative release of NIC and COL from COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs was determined by HPLC and UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. All experiments were performed in triplicate.\n\n## Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay\nThe MICs of the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs to the 10 COL-R strains were measured by broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (34), and E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as the quality control. All drugs were diluted using 2-fold serial dilutions in a sterile 96-well microtiter plate with Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), and then, 100\u2009\u03bcL of the bacterial suspensions (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFUs/mL) was added to each well. MIC values were defined as the lowest concentrations of drugs with no visible growth of bacteria after 18\u2009h of incubation at 37\u00b0C.\n\n## Time-kill curves\nTo further investigate the bactericidal activity of the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs, the time\u2013kill curves of randomly selected clinical COL-resistant Salmonella SH134 (mcr-1 positive) isolate and S2a (mcr-1 negative) were determined during the exponential growth phase as described with some modifications (14). Bacterial cells at a final concentration of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 CFUs/mL were cultured with MHB in NIC (1\u2009\u03bcg/mL), COL (2\u2009\u03bcg/mL), blank-NEs, and the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs (containing COL and NIC at 2 and 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively). Samples of the bacterial cells were collected after culturing for 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24\u2009h and spread on LB agar plates after dilution. CFUs were calculated after incubation at 37\u00b0C overnight. All experiments were repeated three times on different days.\n\n## Fluorescence assay\nTo investigate the antibacterial mechanisms of COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC NEGs, we conducted fluorescence experiments. Bacterial pretreatments in all measurements were performed with similar protocols as follows. In the fluorescence assay, the mcr-1-positive strain SH134 was chosen as the indicator strain. Briefly, bacteria were grown overnight at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 200\u2009rpm. Then, the cultures were washed and suspended with 5\u2009mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.0, plus 5\u2009mmol/L glucose). The OD600 of bacteria suspension was standardized to 0.5 in the same buffer, and fluorescent dye was added. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, an aliquot of 1\u2009mL of bacterial suspension was mixed with the same concentration of free COL, free NIC, free COL and NIC, blank-NEs, COL/NIC-NEs, and COL/NIC-NEGs. After incubation for 1\u2009h, 200\u2009\u03bcL of bacterial cells was added to the 96-well plate. Subsequently, fluorescence intensity was measured on a Spark 10\u2009M Microplate reader (Tecan) (35).\n\n## Outer membrane permeability assay\nFluorescent probe 1-Nphenylnaphthylamine (NPN) was used to evaluate the permeability of the bacterial outer membrane (OM). Fluorescence intensity was measured with the excitation wavelength at 350\u2009nm and emission wavelength at 420\u2009nm (36).\n\n## Cell membrane integrity assay\nThe fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide (PI)-labeled (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) in the presence of increasing drugs was measured with an excitation wavelength of 535\u2009nm and emission wavelength of 615\u2009nm.\n\n## Proton motive force assay\nPMF consists of two components, including the membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8) and the transmembrane proton gradient (\u0394pH). The membrane potential of Salmonella SH134 was measured with 3,3-dipropylthiothiobromocyanide (DiSC3 (5), 0.5\u2009\u03bcM) (Aladdin, Shanghai, China). Fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 622\u2009nm and an emission wavelength of 670\u2009nm. The pH gradient (\u0394pH) was determined by applying the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe BCECF-AM (20\u2009\u03bcM) (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The excitation and emission wavelengths on the fluorescence spectrometer were set to 500 and 522\u2009nm, respectively (37).\n\n## Efflux pump assay\nThe fluorescence dye ethidium bromide (EtBr 5\u2009\u03bcM) was used to assess the inhibitory effect of COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs on the activities of efflux pumps. The well-known efflux pump inhibitor CCCP (100\u2009\u03bcM) was used as a positive control. The efflux of EtBr from bacterial cells was measured using an excitation wavelength of 530\u2009nm and an emission wavelength of 600\u2009nm.\n\n## Total ROS measurement\n2\u2032,7\u2032-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, 10\u2009\u03bcM) was used to monitor the levels of ROS in Salmonella strain (13). Briefly, the bacteria suspension was exposed to various groups of treatment for an additional 30\u2009min, and the supernatant of the mixture was mixed with chromogenic solution from a ROS Assay Kit (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer instructions. Fluorescence intensity was monitored after 30\u2009min of incubation at excitation/emission of 488/525\u2009nm at 37\u00b0C.\n\nFifty-six KM mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n\u2009=\u20098) for survival experiments. All mice were treated with streptomycin by gastric administration 3\u2009days before the formal experiment. Each group was infected with Salmonella SH134 at 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 CFUs by intraperitoneal injection administration in addition to the blank control group. Each group was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 3\u2009days with the following methods: PBS, model, free COL (5\u2009mg/kg), free NIC (5\u2009mg/kg), free COL+NIC (COL 5\u2009mg/kg, NIC 2.5\u2009mg/kg), and COL/NIC-NEs (COL 5\u2009mg/kg, NIC 2.5\u2009mg/kg). Particularly worth mentioning is that the COL/NIC-NEGs (COL 10\u2009mg/kg, NIC 5\u2009mg/kg) group was treated by injection only on the first day. The survival rate of mice in each group was observed for up to 5\u2009days.\nAnother six groups (n\u2009=\u20096) with a sublethal dose of Salmonella SH134 at 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFUs received the same treatment as described above. Colony colonization and histopathology of the liver and spleen were studied. All mice were killed by cervical dislocation on the second day. The tissue samples were ground for continuous dilution and plated on SS agar plates to observe the number of colonies. The typical lesions of livers or spleens of different groups of mice were prepared by hematoxylin\u2013eosin (HE) staining, and histopathological analysis was performed.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nAll experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. All values are stated as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Unpaired t-tests (normally distributed data) between two groups and one-way ANOVA among multiple groups were used to calculate p-values. Statistical significance was determined at *<p 0.05, **p<0.01, and ***p<0.001; ns denotes no significant difference.\n\n## Synergistic antibacterial effects of niclosamide on colistin-resistant \nCheckerboard assays were used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of a combination of NIC and COL against COL-resistant Salmonella (13). As shown in Figure 2A, a synergistic effect was observed in mcr-1-positive and mcr-1-negative strains. NIC robustly reversed COL resistance, with the MIC of COL decreased to a sensitivity of no more than 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL, with FIC indices lower than 0.5 for all the tested resistant strains (FICI\u2009=\u20090.0195\u20130.129) (Figure 2B and Table 1). Importantly, the MIC of COL in combination ranging from 0.0625 to 1.0\u2009\u03bcg/mL was lower than the resistance breakpoint, which was set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute at 4 to 8\u2009\u03bcg/mL for Gram-negative bacteria. These results demonstrated that the NIC can reverse the resistance phenotype of COL-resistant Salmonella.\n\n## Measurement of niclosamide solubility\nThe drug absorption and bioavailability of NIC when administered in combination with COL in vivo may be limited by its poor solubility. The selection of oil phase, surfactant, and co-surfactant with high solubility is the basis of the successful preparation of nanoemulsion. Oil phase drug solubilizing capacity is a crucial characteristic as it affects the potential of formulation for drug loading. As shown in Figure 3A, among three oil phases, the solubility of NIC in EO (1.54\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009mg/mL) is a little more than that in IPM (1.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2009mg/mL) and castor oil (1.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06\u2009mg/mL). Moreover, due to the advantages of strong permeability, easy absorption, high stability, good safety, and low toxicity of EO, EO was selected for further investigation for nanoemulsion studies as oil bases (38). Surfactant EL had the highest solubility (10.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64\u2009mg/mL) of NIC among the different surfactants, followed by Tween-20 (2.63\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009mg/mL), OP (1.77\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1\u2009mg/mL), and Tween-80 (1.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009mg/mL). Among the different co-surfactants, PEG400 and ethyl alcohol showed higher solubility than the isopropanol and propylene glycol. Thus, we selected oil phase (EO), surfactant (EL, Tween-20, and OP), and co-surfactant (PEG400, ethyl alcohol, and isopropanol) for subsequent pseudo-ternary phase diagram screening.\n\n## Construction of phase solubility diagrams, selection of nanoemulsion components, and preparation of COL/NIC-NEs\nThe pseudo-ternary phase diagram, which compares the microemulsion region, is an effective evaluation technique (39). As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, surfactant EL had the largest microemulsion area compared with Tween-20 and OP, indicating that EL is a surfactant suitable for NIC nanoemulsions. According to Supplementary Figure S2, a comparison of the microemulsion region of ethyl alcohol, PEG400, and isopropanol, with the biggest microemulsion region, was chosen as the co-surfactant for NIC nanoemulsions. Surfactant/co-surfactant (Smix) ratio plays a very important role in preparing more stable and effective nanoemulsions. As shown in Figure 3B, pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed by using different Smix ratios (1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 3:2). The results show that the microemulsion region is the largest when the Smix ratio is 3:1, which indicates that the formation of nanoemulsion is the strongest, so it can be used in the final formulation. Based on the pseudo-ternary phase diagrams, EO, EL, and ethyl alcohol were chosen, respectively, as oil phase, surfactant, and co-surfactant of NIC nanoemulsions.\nBlank nanoemulsions were optimized based on different proportion factors in the prescription. Significant changes were observed by changing these prescriptions in different proportions. The final formulation was prepared based on the optimized blank nanoemulsion formula (NE1 to NE6). As shown in Figure 3C and Supplementary Table S2, NE6 has the characteristics of small particle size and small PDI, compared with other formulations, so NE6 is selected as the final formulation of the COL/NIC-NEs.\n\n## Characterization of the COL/NIC-NEs\nThe COL/NIC-NEs were prepared according to the optimized formulation NE6. The preparation process of COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs is illustrated in Figure 1A. The appearance of the COL/NIC-NEs as shown in Figure 1B was yellow, clear, and transparent liquid. The mean particle sizes, PDI, and zeta potentials of the COL/NIC-NEs were measured using DLS. The average hydrodynamic diameter of the COL/NIC-NEs droplets was about 19.86\u2009\u00b1\u20092.21\u2009nm, with a PDI of 0.103\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 (Figure 1C), and the zeta potential of the COL/NIC-NEs was \u22121.25 mv (Figure 1D), indicating that the nanoemulsions had satisfactory quality results. From the images obtained by TEM analysis, it is evident that COL/NIC-NEs showed spherical, non-adhesive, non-aggregating, and evenly distributed in space, the sizes of the nanodroplets corresponded to the ones measured with DLS, as evident from Figure 1E.\nTo investigate the stability of the COL/NIC-NEs, we conducted centrifugation stability, temperature stability, and long-term storage stability tests. The centrifugal stability study found that after centrifugation, the COL/NIC-NEs did not layer or precipitate, and remained a yellow clear transparent liquid with no significant changes in particle size and PDI, indicating that the formula has good centrifugal stability (Figure 1F). In the study of temperature stability (Figure 1G), the COL/NIC-NEs remained stable at low temperatures of \u221220\u00b0C, refrigerated temperature of 4\u00b0C, room temperature of 25\u00b0C, and 60\u00b0C, exhibiting minimal changes in particle size and PDI. However, after treatment at 80\u00b0C, the particle size of COL/NIC-NEs significantly increased from 19.34\u2009nm to 112.6\u2009nm, indicating that the COL/NIC-NEs are unstable at 80\u00b0C and high temperatures can disrupt the dispersion system of the nanoemulsion. Long-term storage stability is a necessary precondition for the practical application of nanoemulsions. As shown in Figure 1H, the long-term stability experiment found that the COL/NIC-NEs system remained relatively stable within 1\u20137\u2009days, with a particle size of around 20\u2009nm. Over longer storage periods, it was found that the particle size slowly increased. However, despite the rise, the sizes of COL/NIC-NEs were still in the acceptable range of nanoemulsion.\n\n## Fabrication and validation of COL/NIC-NEs loaded gel\nFollowing the optimization studies, a thermal sensitivity situ gel loaded with COL/NIC-NEs was prepared. Then, the evaluation of the COL/NIC-NEGs of poloxamer 407 and 188 for temperature was carried out at two different temperatures, i.e., 2\u20138\u00b0C and 36\u201338\u00b0C, respectively, to verify the thermosensitivity of the in situ gels. As shown in Figure 1I, the COL/NIC-NEGs remained at a transparent solution state at 2\u20138\u00b0C and the solution state of the COL/NIC-NEGs transformed into the gel state at 36\u201338\u00b0C. The pH of the COL/NIC-NEGs measured by the PH meter is 6.51, which meets the requirements of injection preparations. The results show that the prescription conditions of the COL/NIC-NEGs are reasonable and feasible.\n\n## FTIR\nAs shown in Figure 4A, the COL spectrum (black) showed characteristic peaks at 1657\u2009cm\u22121 (\u2212C=O amide bonds) and 2,958\u2009cm\u22121 (\u2212CH stretching). The characteristic FTIR spectrum of NIC (red) signaling includes bending vibration of phenolic hydroxyl groups (\u2212C\u2009\u2212\u2009O), \u2212NO2 bending, and\u2009\u2212\u2009C=O stretching bending, which occur at 1327\u20131329, 1,508\u20131,510, and 1,652\u20131,653\u2009cm\u22121, respectively. Major peaks of the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs appeared at wave numbers 2,924\u20132,925, 1,641\u20131,643, 1,456\u20131,460, and 1,349\u2009cm\u22121. The FTIR spectrum of COL/NIC-NEs (blue) and COL/NIC-NEGs (green) showed lower peak intensities, which suggests a good blend of COL and NIC with the selected excipients without the presence of chemical interactions.\n\nTo investigate the extended-release effect, we evaluated the NIC and COL-release from the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs at 37\u00b0C in PBS (pH 7.4) (Figure 4B). The release profile demonstrated an initial burst release of free COL and NIC within the 6\u2009h (96.63\u2009\u00b1\u20092.31% and 61.82\u2009\u00b1\u20091.85%, respectively). The release rate of COL in COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs was 88.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38% and 82.88\u2009\u00b1\u20091.87%, respectively, at 96\u2009h. Similarly, the release rate of free NIC was 75.89\u2009\u00b1\u20090.56%, that of COL/NIC-NEs was 64.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52%, and that of COL/NIC-NEGs was 56.92\u2009\u00b1\u20093.19%. After fitting, COL and NIC in COL/NIC-NEs conform to the first-order release model (adjusted R2\u2009=\u20090.91923 and 0.98597, respectively), and the equation that COL and NIC in COL/NIC-NEGs conform to is the Higuchi model (adjusted R2\u2009=\u20090.98644 and 0.97862, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S3). As expected, the release of drugs NIC and COL from COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs was slower than the free NIC and COL. It shows that NIC- and COL-loaded nanoemulsions and nanoemulsion gels have slow-release effects, achieving the effect of reducing the amount and increasing the efficiency.\n\n## Antibacterial activity of the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs \nTo study the antibacterial effects of COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs, we examined the MIC of the COL, NIC, COL/NIC-NEs, and COL/NIC-NEGs, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Compared with alone COL, the MIC of COL in the combination of the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs was decreased significantly, which was reduced by 16-128-fold (Figure 5A). Excitingly, a synergistic effect in the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs was observed in all the tested mcr-1-positive and mcr-1-negative COL-resistant strains. To further evaluate the synergetic effect of the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs, we performed the time\u2013kill curves assays using mcr-1-positive strain SH134 and mcr-1-negative strain S2a as a pattern strain. The results suggested that the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs exhibited synergistic bactericidal efficacy. Specifically, neither alone NIC nor COL killed Salmonella SH134 and Salmonella S2a in the medium. However, the COL/NIC-NEs and COL/NIC-NEGs decreased CFUs of Salm",
