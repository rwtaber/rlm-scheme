  "title": "Mechanisms Underlying Synergistic Killing of Polymyxin B in Combination with Cannabidiol against Acinetobacter baumannii: A Metabolomic Study.",
  "abstract": "Polymyxins have resurged as the last-resort antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. As reports of polymyxin resistance in A. baumannii with monotherapy have become increasingly common, combination therapy is usually the only remaining treatment option. A novel and effective strategy is to combine polymyxins with non-antibiotic drugs. This study aimed to investigate, using untargeted metabolomics, the mechanisms of antibacterial killing synergy of the combination of polymyxin B with a synthetic cannabidiol against A. baumannii ATCC 19606. The antibacterial synergy of the combination against a panel of Gram-negative pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was also explored using checkerboard and static time-kill assays. The polymyxin B-cannabidiol combination showed synergistic antibacterial activity in checkerboard and static time-kill assays against both polymyxin-susceptible and polymyxin-resistant isolates. The metabolomics study at 1 h demonstrated that polymyxin B monotherapy and the combination (to the greatest extent) significantly perturbed the complex interrelated metabolic pathways involved in the bacterial cell envelope biogenesis (amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, peptidoglycan, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis), nucleotides (purine and pyrimidine metabolism) and peptide metabolism; notably, these pathways are key regulators of bacterial DNA and RNA biosynthesis. Intriguingly, the combination caused a major perturbation in bacterial membrane lipids (glycerophospholipids and fatty acids) compared to very minimal changes induced by monotherapies. At 4 h, polymyxin B-cannabidiol induced more pronounced effects on the abovementioned pathways compared to the minimal impact of monotherapies. This metabolomics study for the first time showed that in disorganization of the bacterial envelope formation, the DNA and RNA biosynthetic pathways were the most likely molecular mechanisms for the synergy of the combination. The study suggests the possibility of cannabidiol repositioning, in combination with polymyxins, for treatment of MDR polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative infections.",

  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance has become a major threat to health and economic wellbeing worldwide [1]. The rapid emergence of MDR Gram-negative pathogens (e.g., carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii) that cause difficult or impossible-to-treat infections is gaining momentum [1,2]. A. baumannii is often associated with serious nosocomial and community-acquired infections e.g., pneumonia and blood stream infections [3,4]. In the 1970s, this notorious pathogen was thought to be sensitive to most antibiotics, but today it appears to have extensive resistance to most currently used antibiotics, including polymyxins [5]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has, therefore, listed this pathogen as one of the top-priority pathogens that urgently need new antibiotics [6]. The clinical pipeline for new antimicrobials is dry; therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat these deadly pathogens is warranted [1,7].\nColistin, also known as polymyxin E, and polymyxin B (cyclic lipopeptides) are last-resort antibiotics for Gram-negative pathogens resistant to essentially all other antibiotics [8]. It is purported that polymyxins exert their antimicrobial action primarily by disorganizing the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM) via direct interaction with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS); however, the precise mechanism of action is still uncertain [9,10]. Worryingly, there has been an increase in reports of polymyxin resistance among Gram-negative bacteria, including A. baumannii, particularly following polymyxin monotherapy [11,12,13]. The complete LPS loss or lipid A modification with positively charged moieties (phosphoethanolamine (PEtN) or galactosamine (GalN)) are considered the most common modes of polymyxin resistance observed in A. baumannii [12,14,15].\nA cost-effective strategy that is gaining momentum is the combination of antibiotics with non-antibiotic compounds that facilitate the exertion of \u2018off-target\u2019 antibacterial properties against the bacterial cell [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. The advent of metabolomics, comprising cutting-edge bioanalytical techniques and bioinformatics, provides a new strategy for fathoming the complex interactions between cellular processes and elucidating the complex modes of action following antibiotic exposure [24,25,26,27].\nCannabis sativa is an herbaceous plant that has been used as a medicinal and recreational agent for centuries worldwide [28]. This complex plant comprises more than 400 chemical entities, including many terpenes and approximately 180 cannabinoids (e.g., \u03949 tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949 THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) [29,30]. The antibacterial activity of cannabinoids was reported in detail for the first time in the 1950s [31,32]. Later, in 1976, van Klingeren et al. reported that \u22069-THC and CBD displayed bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against a panel of Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci and streptococci [33]. However, the cannabinoids\u2019 antimicrobial effects had been largely overlooked until 2008, when the antibacterial activity of five major cannabinoids (CBD, THC, cannabichromene (CBC), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol (CBN)) were tested against a wide range of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. The study revealed that all compounds possessed low MIC values (0.5\u20132\u2009\u03bcg/\u2009mL) [34]. As a result, there has been growing interest in the antibacterial properties of cannabinoids in the quest to discover new lead compounds. Subsequent and more recent studies have provided further insights into the chemical and antimicrobial characterization of various chemical entities in Cannabis sativa as well as synthetic CBD [35,36,37].\nMark and co-workers recently confirmed their previous findings by testing the killing activity of CBD against highly resistant Staphylococcus aureus (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridioides difficile as well as the \u2018urgent threat\u2019 Gram-negative pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. They also noticed that cannabinoids were able to effectively disorganize biofilms and sustain their antibacterial effects under extended exposure conditions [38]. Furthermore, in line with previous reports, the study showed that CBD was inactive against the most notorious Gram-negative pathogens, namely K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. However, combining CBD with colistin and polymyxin B caused a synergistic killing effect against A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, suggesting that polymyxins might permeabilize the outer membrane and enable the entry of CBD to exert its action [38,39]. The mechanistic studies (including radiolabeled macromolecular synthesis assays, membrane depolarization assays and fluorescent microscopy) of CBD against S. aureus indicated that CBD disrupts the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, though the precise mode of action is still elusive and further studies at the molecular level are warranted [38].\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial synergy of synthetic CBD in combination with polymyxin B against a panel of polymyxin-resistant and -susceptible Gram-negative pathogens and elucidate, for the first time, the potential mechanism of the bacterial killing effects of polymyxins enhanced by CBD against A. baumannii, using untargeted metabolomics. The presented findings underlie the effective synergy and clinical potential of the polymyxin B\u2013CBD combination for the treatment of MDR polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative infections.\n\n## 2.1. Bacterial Isolates\nTen different A. baumannii isolates, including 5 polymyxin B-susceptible and 5 polymyxin B-resistant strains; 10 different K. pneumoniae isolates, including 6 polymyxin B-susceptible and 4 polymyxin B-resistant strains; and 7 different P. aeruginosa isolates, including 3 polymyxin B-susceptible and 4 polymyxin B-resistant strains (Table 1), were employed in this study.\n\n## 2.2. Determination of MIC and FIC\nThe MICs of polymyxin B and CBD were determined for all bacterial isolates in triplicate on separate days using broth microdilution checkerboard assays. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that shows a complete inhibition of visible bacterial growth after overnight incubation. The polymyxin B and CBD stock solutions were prepared immediately before each experiment. Polymyxin B (Betapharma, Shanghai, China) powder was dissolved in MilliQ water and sterilized by membrane syringe filters with a pore size of 0.22 micron (ThermoFisher Scientific, Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Cannabidiol (CBD) (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Serial concentrations of DMSO (0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2.5% v/v) showed no inhibitory effect against all bacteria tested. Serial dilutions (2-fold) of the polymyxin B and CBD were prepared in a cation-adjusted Mueller\u2013Hinton broth (CAMHB; Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) to obtain solutions with various concentrations. The experiments were performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Techno Plas, Adelaide, SA, Australia) in broth culture containing ~106 CFU/mL of the bacteria tested. The microdilution plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18\u201320 h.\nThe synergy tests for the combination were conducted using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) analysis. The formula used to calculate the FIC values was as follows: FICI = (MIC of drug A in combination \u00f7 MIC of drug A alone) + (MIC of drug B in combination \u00f7 MIC of drug B alone). The FICI results were defined as: synergism FIC < 0.5; addition FIC = 0.5\u20131.0; indifference FIC = 1\u20134; antagonism FIC \u2265 4 [22]. An MIC of 128 \u00b5g/mL for CBD was used to calculate the FICI scores.\n\n## 2.3. Static Time-Kill Studies\nBased on FIC results, static time-kill assays of polymyxin B monotherapy and in combination with CBD were performed against selected strains from different species. Prior to each time-kill assay, a sub-culture of the selected bacterial isolate was prepared from its stock cultures and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18~24 h. To prepare overnight culture, a single colony was transferred from nutrient agar plate to inoculate 10 mL of fresh CAMHB (Oxoid, UK) in a 50 mL Falcon tube (ThermoFisher Scientific, Australia) and incubated overnight (~16 h) in a water bath shaker at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C and 150 rpm shaking speed. Subsequently, the log phase was induced by inoculating 100 \u00b5L from the overnight culture into 10 mL of fresh CAMHB broth and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a water bath shaker (shaking speed, 150 rpm) for 2 h. A 200 \u00b5L aliquot of bacterial suspension was inoculated into 4 borosilicate culture tubes (capacity 50 mL) containing 20 mL (1:100 dilution) of fresh CAMHB each. Three treatment tubes containing a starting culture of bacteria were spiked with the desired concentrations of polymyxin B and CBD monotherapies or in combination. One culture tube was drug-free to represent the control. At 0, 1, 4, 8 and 24 h, samples were taken from each tube and serially diluted in 0.9% saline, and then automatically plated onto nutrient agar plates using a Whitley Automated Spiral Plater (WASP). After 24 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the number of colonies on the plates were counted, and the time-kill graphs were plotted as time (hours) vs. log10 CFU/mL.\n\n## 2.4. Bacterial Culture Preparation for Metabolomics\nSingle colonies of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 grown on a nutrient agar plate (Media Preparation Unit, University of Melbourne, Australia) were picked and inoculated into 10 mL of CAMHB (Oxoid, UK) in a 50 mL Falcon tube (ThermoFisher Scientific, Australia) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight (~16 h) in a water bath shaker (150 rpm). The next day, a 100-fold dilution of bacterial culture was prepared by transferring a small amount of the overnight culture into 500 mL conical flasks (\u00d74) containing fresh CAMHB. The flasks were immediately incubated in an incubator shaker (Bioline) at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm to log phase of ~108 CFU/mL (OD600~0.5). Stock solutions of polymyxin B, CBD, or the combination were added accordingly to three treatment flasks with concentrations of 2 mg/L for polymyxin B, 4 mg/L for cannabidiol, and the combination of both compounds; the fourth flask served as control (drug-free). Samples were then taken at each time point (1 and 4 h) and immediately quenched to pause further bacterial metabolism. Subsequently, the OD600 reading for all samples was measured and normalized to ~0.5 with fresh CAMHB. The bacterial cells were pelleted with centrifugation at 3220\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10\u2009min, and the supernatants were removed subsequently. The pellets were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C, awaiting metabolite extraction. Four biological replicates were prepared for each treatment condition to reduce the bias from inherent random variation.\n\n## 2.5. Metabolite Extraction\nThe bacterial pellets were washed twice in 1 mL of 0.9% saline and centrifuged at 3220\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. A cold extraction solvent (chloroform: methanol: water) containing 1 \u00b5M each of the internal standards (CHAPS, CAPS, PIPES and TRIS) was used to re-suspend the bacterial pellets. The pellets were then exposed to three freeze-thaw cycles (using liquid nitrogen) to release the intracellular metabolites. After the freezing and thawing process, the supernatants were obtained after centrifugation at 3220\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and immediately transferred into an injection vial for liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) analysis. An equal volume of each sample was combined and used as a quality control (QC) [40].\n\n## 2.6. Data Processing, Bioinformatics, and Statistical Analyses\nThe LC\u2013MS data processing, bioinformatics and statistical analysis were performed as we have previously described [41].\n\n## 3.1. Synergy Testing of Polymyxin B\u2013Cannabidiol Combinations (FICI Calculation)\nThe synergistic antibacterial activity of polymyxin B and CBD as monotherapies and in combination was tested against a panel of clinical isolates of A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae (Table 1). The polymyxin B and CBD combinations demonstrated synergistic antibacterial activity against all of the tested strains of the three species A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae except for one A. baumannii (the LPS-deficient A. baumannii FADDI-AB065, indifference FICI = 2) and one P. aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa FADDI-PA019m, additive FICI = 0.53) (Table 1). On the other hand, polymyxin B and CBD monotherapies were found to be ineffective (MICs 8 to >128 mg/L) against the polymyxin B-resistant isolates (except for A. baumannii FADDI-AB065, CBD MIC = 0.5 mg/L) (Table 1).\n\n## 3.2. Static Time-Kill Studies\nThe time-kill assessment of polymyxin B and CBD as monotherapies or in combination was further carried out against polymyxin B-susceptible A. baumannii strain ATCC 19606 (polymyxin B MIC = 1 mg/L, CBD MIC > 64 mg/L) and polymyxin B-resistant A. baumannii strain FADDI-AB144 (polymyxin B MIC = 8 mg/L, CBD MIC > 64 mg/L); polymyxin B-resistant P. aeruginosa strains FADDI-PA070 (polymyxin B MIC = 128 mg/L, CBD MIC > 64 mg/L) and FADDI-PA006 (polymyxin B MIC = 8 mg/L, CBD MIC > 64 mg/L); and polymyxin B-susceptible K. pneumoniae strain FADDI-KP002 (polymyxin B MIC = 0.5 mg/L, CBD MIC > 64 mg/L) and polymyxin B-resistant K. pneumoniae strain FADDI-KP012 (polymyxin B MIC = 32 mg/L, CBD MIC > 64 mg/L) (Figure 1).\nPolymyxin B monotherapy displayed significant killing activity against A. baumannii ATCC 19606, as manifested by a >2 log10 CFU/mL decline in bacterial counts compared with the control (untreated) at early time points (1 and 4 h); however, the killing curve of polymyxin B was comparable with the control at 24 h. Insignificant killing effect against the same strain was observed following CBD monotherapy across all time points (Figure 1). On the other hand, polymyxin B\u2013CBD combination showed a higher killing curve compared to the control at all time exposures (>\u22122 log10 CFU/mL, 1 h; \u2265\u22124 log10 CFU/mL, 4 and 8 h; >\u22123.5 log10 CFU/mL, 24 h). No significant decrease in the bacterial burden was noticed following polymyxin B (except at 4 h, \u22122 log10 CFU/mL) and CBD monotherapy against FADDI-AB144 at all time points, whilst a more than 4 log10 CFU/mL decrease in bacterial count compared with control was seen after the combination at 1 and 4 h (Figure 1). The combination also continued to reduce the bacterial burden by \u22652 log10 CFU/mL at later time points (8 and 24 h). Against K. pneumoniae strains, although a higher killing curve was observed after polymyxin B monotherapy (\u22123.0 log10 CFU/mL) against K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP002 at early time points (1 and 4 h), inconsistent regrowth occurred, with very minor log10 CFU/mL difference compared to the control after 24 h. Notably, the combination therapy was more effective in bacterial killing, as manifested by a \u22654.0\u20136.0 log10 CFU/mL decrease in bacterial counts compared with untreated controls across all time points (except 24 h). However, a completely different scene was observed against K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP012, wherein polymyxin B monotherapy did not display significant bacterial killing at all time points, as manifested by time-kill curves that resembled untreated controls (Figure 1). Nevertheless, polymyxin B and CBD combination therapy displayed potent bacterial killing effect, peaking at 1 and 4 h with a 3.0\u20136.0 log10 CFU/mL decline in bacterial counts compared to the control, which was sustained with a 3.0\u20134.0 log10 CFU/mL decline after 8 and 24 h, respectively, compared to the control (Figure 1). Regarding P. aeruginosa strains, only the combination therapy was effective in causing significant bacterial killing activity, as manifested by a >1.5\u20133 log10 CFU/mL (FADDI-PA006) and >5\u20136 log10 CFU/mL (FADDI-PA070) decrease in the bacterial burden across all time exposures (Figure 1). CBD monotherapy displayed no antimicrobial activity against any of the strains assessed during 24 h treatment, which was indicated by a time-kill curve pattern similar to the untreated control (Figure 1).\nThe current findings suggest that the synergy between polymyxin B and the CBD most likely arises from bioavailability synergy [42], which means that polymyxins permeabilize the Gram-negative OM and thereby allow the entry of CBD into the intracellular compartment to subsequently exert its action on its intracellular targets [36,38].\n\n## 3.3. Metabolomics Analysis of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 Treated with Polymyxin B, Cannabidiol, and Their Combination\nA total of 1127 putatively acquired metabolites were obtained; the highest number of metabolites (except for undefined class) belonged to lipid metabolism (268), followed by peptide metabolism (180) and amino acid metabolism (175). Nucleotides (41), carbohydrates (30), cofactor and vitamins (30), secondary metabolites (15), and glycans (3) were the least identified metabolite classes (Supplementary Figure S1).\nThe significant metabolites were determined by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (\u22650.58-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05). The data precision of all sample groups was agreeable at both time points (1 and 4 h), where the median RSDs were (17\u201323%) and (19\u201326%) for untreated (control) and treated samples, respectively, at all time points, consistent with some baseline dynamic variations in bacterial metabolism (Supplementary Table S1). The PCA plots demonstrated that the combination treatment samples were significantly distinguished from the untreated control samples, moderately at 1 h and largely at 4 h (Supplementary Figure S2A). Notably, the polymyxin B and combination treatments were nearly overlapped at 1 h, suggesting that polymyxin B initially governed the synergy of the combination treatment, whereas polymyxin B alone closely resembled the untreated control samples at the later time point, 4 h (Supplementary Figure S2A). CBD treated samples were undistinguished from the untreated control groups across all time exposures (1 and 4 h) (Supplementary Figure S2A). The same pattern of differences between the treated and untreated (control) groups was observed with the heatmaps (Supplementary Figure S2B).\nA higher perturbation was induced by the combination treatment, as indicated by a perturbation of 267 (204 decreased and 63 increased) and 152 (139 decreased and 13 increased) significant metabolites at 1 and 4 h, respectively, whereas polymyxin B monotherapy perturbed 187 (174 decreased and 13 increased) significant metabolites at 1 h and a far smaller number at 4 h, with only 50 significantly decreased metabolites. CBD showed less effect, significantly perturbing only 29 (15 decreased and 14 increased) and 10 (6 decreased and 4 increased) significant metabolites at 1 and 4 h, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3A).\nThe metabolic profiling analysis of the significantly altered metabolites indicated that the combination treatment, at both time points, largely perturbed (mainly decreased) lipids, amino acids and peptides compared to the slightly impacted metabolite carbohydrates, nucleotides and cofactors and vitamin metabolism (Supplementary Figure S3B). Likewise, but to a lesser extent, polymyxin B monotherapy induced a similar pattern, wherein lipids, amino acids and peptides were the impacted metabolite classes (Supplementary Figure S3B). On the other hand, CBD monotherapy caused a suppression in the levels of lipid intermediates (mainly at 1 h) and an elevation in the levels of amino acids (mainly at 4 h) (Supplementary Figure S3B). Notably, the combination treatment induced 148 and 103 unique significant metabolites at 1 and 4 h, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3C). There were only 10 and 4 intermediates in common between all treatment conditions at 1 and 4 h, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3C). The combination treatment shared ~30\u201335% of the intermediates with polymyxin B monotherapy at 1 and 4 h (Supplementary Figure S3C).\n\n## 3.3.1. Analyses of Dysregulated Glycerophospholipid and Fatty Acid Metabolism\nThe major lipid components of the cellular envelope of Gram-negative bacteria include phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cardiolipin [43]. These lipid precursors are crucial to maintaining the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope to adapt and survive under ever-changing environmental stress [44].\nAt 1 h, polymyxin B\u2013CBD combination therapy induced significantly more perturbations in all lipid classes, including fatty acids and glycerophospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylserine, PS; glycerophosphocholines, PC; phosphatidylethanolamine, PE; glycerophosphates, PA; and phosphatidylglycerol, PG) compared to the polymyxin B and CBD monotherapies (Figure 2A). The combination treatment caused more overrepresentation in the levels of glycerophospholipids compared to other lipid classes such as fatty acids. Notably, phosphatidylethanolamine (log2FC = \u22121.5), and 1-hexadecanoyl-2-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (synonym: 1-palmitoylglycerol 3-phosphate, log2FC = 1.8) were among the significantly impacted glycerophospholipids following the combination treatment at 1 h (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the abundance of principal constituents of bacterial membrane lipids such as 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (phosphatidic acid) (log2FC = 1.9), sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (log2FC = \u22121.1), sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (log2FC = \u22122.4), 2,3-Bis-O-(geranylgeranyl)glycerol 1-phosphate (log2FC = \u22120.88), and trans-hexadec-2-enoyl-CoA (log2FC = \u22124.1) were significantly altered following combination treatment (Figure 2A,B) [45,46]. Similarly, fundamental building blocks of membrane lipids as well as the lipid A part of lipopolysaccharides, fatty acids, underwent significant perturbations following combination treatment, including hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid, log2FC = \u22121.4), FA(16:1) (log2FC = \u22122.4), FA(14:1) (log2FC = \u22121.4) and FA(17:0) (log2FC = \u22120.88) (Figure 2A) [47,48].\nThe impact of polymyxin B monotherapy was far less than that from the combination treatment at 1 h, and glycerophospholipids experienced a greater perturbation compared to fatty acids (Figure 2A). Importantly, the main precursors of bacterial lipid membrane, which are involved in fatty acid elongation and assembly of glycerolipids, were significantly altered following polymyxin B monotherapy, namely oleoyl-CoA, trans-hexadec-2-enoyl-CoA, phosphatidylethanolamine, sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (\u2265\u22121.0-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 2A,B). Notably, although cannabidiol caused marginal effect on lipid metabolism at 1 h, it induced a significant perturbation in the levels of major lipid intermediates of bacterial membrane, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (log2FC = \u22121.0), trans-hexadec-2-enoyl-CoA (log2FC = \u22121.1), sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (log2FC = \u22121.5) and 1-hexadecanoyl-2-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (log2FC = 1.5) (Figure 2A,B).\nOn the other hand, at 4 h, although the impact of combination therapy on lipid metabolism declined, a remarkable perturbation pattern of lipid intermediates particularly against glycerophospholipids was observed (Figure 2C). The levels of two essential lipids (sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) involved in the rate-limiting step of the biosynthesis of bacterial membrane phosphatidic acid declined in response to the combination therapy (\u2265\u22121.0-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 2C) [45]. Furthermore, the effect on fatty acid elongation was slightly sustained following the combination therapy, as manifested by a significant decline in the abundance of oleoyl-CoA (log2FC = \u22122.8) (Figure 2C).\nIn comparison, the impact from polymyxin B and cannabidiol monotherapies at 4 h started to disappear; polymyxin B decreased the abundance of oleoyl-CoA, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (\u2265\u22121.0-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05), whereas the level of only one fatty acid precursor significantly declined after cannabidiol treatment (Figure 2C).\n\n## 3.3.2. Analyses of Dysregulated Amino-Sugar and Nucleotide-Sugar Metabolism, the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, and Downstream Peptidoglycan and Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis\nGram-negative bacteria are surrounded by a complex multilayered structure (OM, a thin peptidoglycan cell wall, and inner cell membrane) that protects them from the harsh environment, but selectively enables the passage of nutrients from the outside and waste products from the inside [49]. Notably, polymyxin B\u2013cannabidiol treatment caused a significant perturbation (slightly at 1 h and largely at 4 h) in the abundance of key metabolites involved in amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and the direct interrelated metabolic pathways of cell envelope biogenesis, peptidoglycan, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) formation (Figure 3; Supplementary Figure S4). At 1 h, the abundance of one essential component (UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc)) of amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism and two fundamental precursors of PPP (D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and D-ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P)) underwent a significant decline after the combination treatment (\u2265\u22122.0-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S4). As a downstream consequence, the combination treatment also caused a marked depletion in the abundance of three peptidoglycan building blocks, namely UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamyl-meso-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-\u01b4-D-Glu-m-Dap-D-Ala-D-Ala, log2FC = \u22123.2), D-alanyl-D-alanine (log2FC = \u22125.7), and meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate (log2FC = \u22122.2) (Supplementary Figure S4). Consequently, a dramatic decrease in the levels of two common intermediates (3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO), log2FC = \u22121.2; D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate, log2FC = \u22122.5) of LPS formation was observed following the combination treatment at 1 h (Supplementary Figure S4).\nOn the other hand, at 1 h, although polymyxin B monotherapy caused a significant alteration in the main pathways involved in cell envelope assembly, its effect was less potent compared to that of the combination therapy (Supplementary Figure S4). The levels of one amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar intermediate, UDP-GlcNAc, and two intermediates of PPP (D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and D-ribulose 5-phosphate) experienced a substantial decline after polymyxin B monotherapy (\u2265\u22120.59-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S4). Simultaneously, polymyxin B monotherapy also disrupted peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as manifested by an alteration in the levels of UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-\u01b4-D-Glu-m-Dap-D-Ala-D-Ala (log2FC = \u22122.0), D-alanyl-D-alanine (log2FC = \u22122.0), and meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate (log2FC = \u22121.5) (Supplementary Figure S4). Like the combination treatment, albeit to a lesser extent, polymyxin B alone induced a marked decrease in the abundance of two essential inner-core oligosaccharide moieties of LPS, namely 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate and D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate (\u2265\u22120.59-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S4). Cannabidiol monotherapy induced far less effect on the pathways of bacterial cell envelope formation, wherein the abundance of only UDP-GlcNAc, an amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar intermediate, was considerably reduced after cannabidiol monotherapy (\u2265\u22120.59-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S4).\nAt 4 h, different patterns of perturbation were observed wherein the combination treatment induced a profound inhibitory impact on amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism and PPP, peptidoglycan and LPS biosynthesis (Figure 3A,B). The levels of two important building blocks of amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism, namely UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-N-acetylmuramate (UDP-MurNAc), were depleted after the combination treatment at 4 h (\u2265\u22122.0-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 3A). Similarly to the combination impact at 1 h, the abundance of two crucial PPP precursors (D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and D-ribulose 5-phosphate) was significantly decreased following the combination therapy (\u2265\u22121.5-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 3B). A greater impact on the downstream pathway for peptidoglycan biosynthesis was seen after the combination therapy. This was shown by the fact that the combination markedly decreased the abundance of five peptidoglycan biosynthesis intermediates, namely UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-\u01b4-D-Glu-m-Dap-D-Ala-D-Ala (log2FC = \u22121.9), D-alanine (log2FC = \u22121.5), D-alanyl-D-alanine (log2FC = \u22122.0), L-alanine (log2FC = \u22121.2) and meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate (log2FC = \u22121.2) (Figure 3A). Importantly, the combination treatment caused a profound decrease (log2FC = \u22121.1) in the abundance of undecaprenyl phosphate (C55-P) at 4 h (Figure 3A). The combination treatment also reduced the abundance of two essential components of LPS biogenesis, KDO and D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate (log2FC = \u22122.5 and 1.8, respectively) (Figure 3B).\nAlthough polymyxin B alone perturbed a similar number (except for undecaprenyl phosphate) of intermediates involved in the cell envelope biosynthetic interconnected pathways, it was relatively less potent than the combination therapy at 4 h (Figure 3A,B). This was manifested by a lower intensity reduction in the levels of two amino-sugar and nucleotide-sugar metabolism intermediates (UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-MurNAc) and an equal number of PPP components (D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and Ru5P) due to polymyxin B monotherapy (\u2265\u22120.59-log2-fold; p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 3A,B). Consequently, the abundance of five essential peptidoglycan intermediates was diminished after polymyxin B monotherapy, including UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-\u01b4-D-Glu-m-Dap-D-Ala-D-Ala (log2FC = \u22121.2), D-alanine (log2FC = \u22121.2), D-alanyl-D-alanine (log2FC = \u22121.5), L-alanine (log2FC = \u22121.0) and meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate (log2FC = \u22121.1) (Figure 3A). The impact of polymyxin B monotherapy on the LPS biosynthetic pathway was sustained at 4 h, although it was less potent compared to the combination therapy",
