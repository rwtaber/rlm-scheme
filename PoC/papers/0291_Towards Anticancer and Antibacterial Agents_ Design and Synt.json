  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nPhenothiazine is an important structural motif in medicinal chemistry, showing various biological properties; therefore, phenothiazine derivatives are an excellent example of how small structural changes in the molecule can affect host-guest interactions [1,2]. In other words, a \u2018fragile event\u2019 might occur when even a tiny structural modification can boost or completely demolish the biological activity in QSAR/QSPR studies (termed \u2018magic methyl\u2019) [3]. In practice, phenothiazine derivatives were the first neuroleptic drugs effectively applied due to the presence of an aminoalkyl substituent on the thiazine nitrogen atom, where the distance between the thiazine nitrogen atom and the nitrogen atom of the substituent was three carbon atoms [4]. It was revealed that reducing the above length to two carbon atoms changes the activity from neuroleptic to antihistaminic. As a matter of fact, many different phenothiazine derivatives with interesting biological properties, such as anticancer, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral, have been described so far [5,6,7]. The structures of the synthesized derivatives were modified by introducing a variety of substituents to the thiazine nitrogen atom or swapping one or two benzene rings into nitrogen heterocyclic systems, which led to the corresponding azaphenothiazines [8,9]. On the other hand, there are only a few reports on the introduction of substituents on benzene rings or heterocyclic rings.\n1,2,3-triazoles play a crucial role not only in organic chemistry, but also in medicinal chemistry due to their relevant chemical and biological properties and the ease with which they can be synthesized by click chemistry [10]. 1,2,3-triazoles indicate high aromatic stabilization since they are highly stable under alkaline and acidic hydrolysis as well as under reducing and oxidizing conditions [11]. In fact, such heterocyclic compounds have a high dipole moment and are capable of forming hydrogen bonds (HBs), which are valid in modulating the availability and solubility of biologically active compounds\u2014which is beneficial in binding to biomolecular targets. It should also be emphasized that the triazole ring may act as a biological linker because it exhibits bioisosteric properties with various heteroaromatic and aromatic rings [12,13,14,15]. In consequence, the 1,2,3-triazole scaffold is one of the key structural units found in molecules with diverse biological activity, such as antifungal agents [16], bacterial agents [17,18], antiallergic agents [19], antiviral agents [20,21], antituberculous agents [22,23] and anti-inflammatory agents [24]. Obviously, there are marketed drugs containing a 1,2,3-triazole structural unit, e.g., tazobactam and cefatrizine [25]. Moreover, phenothiazine derivatives with 1,2,3-triazole substituents at the thiazine nitrogen atom (see Figure 1A) were also described as showing cytotoxic properties [26]. In practice, reaction products with a 1,2,3-triazole group in position 4 of the phenothiazine system (see Figure 1B) were synthesized and characterized [27].\nThe details of the preparation of quinobenzothiazinium derivatives that revealed their noteworthy biological properties were presented in our previous reports [28,29,30]. The direction and strength of the antibacterial and anticancer activity depended on the presence and nature of the substituents in the tetracyclic quinobenzothiazinium system. The obtained results indicated that the anticancer effect of quinobenzothiazines may be due to DNA intercalation [31,32]. Furthermore, the comprehensive procedure of implementing different types of substituents into the 9-, 10-, and 11-positions of the quinobenzothiazinium system was reported [33], revealing additionally a dependence of antibacterial and anticancer activity both on the type of substituent and its position in the quinobenzothiazinium system.\nIn the current work, a new methodology for the synthesis of hybrid combinations of 1,2,3-triazoles with a tetracyclic quinobenzothiazinium system was proposed in order to obtain a series of new azaphenothiazine derivatives, where the 1,2,3-triazole motif is attached to different positions of the benzene ring using the methoxylene linker. In practice, the laboratory procedure relies on the reaction of triazole aniline derivatives with thioquinanthrenediinium bis-chloride. It should be emphasized that triazole quinobenzothiazinium derivatives cannot be synthesized directly using propargyl quinobenzothiazinium derivatives with organic azides. Moreover, the spatial geometry of the new products and the composition of atoms in the crystal (unit cell) were determined using X-ray diffraction. The biological potency (anticancer and antibacterial activities) of the obtained triazole quinobenzothiazinium derivatives was examined as a function of 1,2,3-triazole chemical character and the three-dimensional arrangement of substituents (their isomeric forms) in a tetracyclic quinobenzothiazinium system.\nThe distance-related similarity analysis of structurally similar compounds is a common practice that contributes noticeably to the quantitative and/or qualitative structure-activity (SAR) mapping. The chemical composition (topology and/or topography) can be structurally coded by the calculated multidimensional (mD) descriptors and/or represented by the experimental property data. Accordingly, SAR-related exploration of the descriptor-based feature/structural chemical space (CS) seems valid to the quantitative potency modeling and ADMET-tailored property prediction. It is expected that in silico mapping of molecular descriptors that is combined with the experimental findings can support the synthetic efforts at the decision-making phases of hit \u2192 lead \u2192 drug design. Hence, the distance-guided property evaluation was performed using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) on the pool of the calculated descriptors. Moreover, the theoretically approximated partition coefficients (clogP) were (inter-)correlated with each other and cross-compared with the empirically specified logPTLC parameters.\n\n## 2.1. Chemistry\u2014Design and Synthesis\nThe detailed synthesis of phenothiazine and azaphenothiazine derivatives containing 1,2,3-triazole substituents at the thiazine nitrogen atom is known; however, there are only a few reports on analogs that have attached different groups to other positions of the phenothiazine or azaphenothiazine system. In our previous paper, we described the procedure for synthesizing quinobenzothiazinium derivatives substituted in the benzene ring [33]. In fact, the synthesized compounds showed a range of interesting antibacterial properties with very low toxicity to normal human cells under in vitro culture conditions. A compelling (repeatable) dependence of the antibacterial properties on the structure of the tested compounds was revealed as well. Such findings encouraged us to continue efforts in the search for biologically active factors that determine the activity profile of these compounds. Among the generated molecules were derivatives with a propargyl group attached at different positions (9, 10, and 11) of the tetracyclic quinobenzothiazinium system. It seemed that these compounds might be a suitable substrate (starting point) for obtaining hybrid compounds with a 1,2,3-triazole system and a tetracyclic azaphenothiazinium system\u2014a unique structure where the triazole system is attached not to the thiazine nitrogen atom, but to the carbon atoms of the benzene ring. The text continues here (Figure 2).\nThe reactions were carried out in DMF/H2O (see Scheme 1) in the presence of a copper catalyst (CuSO4 \u00d7 5H2O, sodium ascorbate) at room temperature. However, the analysis of the obtained postreaction mixtures by MS mass spectrometry did not show the presence of or even trace amounts of the expected triazole quinobenzothiazinium derivative 2. Compound 1 easily splits hydrogen chloride into the corresponding imine derivative 3, as shown in Scheme 2. In order to exclude the possibility that the hydrogen chloride formed in the reaction medium could hinder the reactions of propargyl derivatives with azides, we decided to obtain product 3 and then carry out reaction tests with azides.\nCompound 3 was prepared by treating aqueous solutions of derivative 1 with a 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. Subsequently, the obtained derivative 3 reacted with azides in analogical reaction conditions to form compound 1. Unfortunately, the analysis of the obtained postreaction mixtures by MS mass spectrometry did not show the presence of or even trace amounts of the expected triazole quinobenzothiazinium derivatives as well. Such results made us decide to introduce the triazole moiety in a different reaction path, as was described in the synthesis of propargyl aniline derivatives [33]. We decided to use these compounds to synthesize aniline 1,2,3-triazole derivatives, which can be substrates in the preparation of 1,2,3-triazole quinobenzothiazinium derivatives.\nWe carried out the reactions in DMF/H2O in the presence of a copper catalyst (CuSO4 \u00d7 5H2O, sodium ascorbate), as presented in Scheme 3. As a matter of fact, commercial azides were used. In the case of the synthesis of the allyl derivatives 5a\u2013c, the allyl azide was prepared by reacting allyl bromide with sodium azide immediately prior to the coupling reaction with the propargyl derivative 4. The synthesis was performed in the one-pot procedure without isolating the azide from the reaction mixture. In practice, the reactions of propargyl derivatives 4b,c with aromatic azide (4-chlorophenyl azide) were conducted in a microwave reactor at 80 \u00b0C. Some of the generated aniline 1,2,3-triazole derivatives were characterized previously [34,35]. The structure of the obtained compounds was confirmed by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and HR-MS spectrometry (see Supplementary Materials (Figures S1\u2013S62)).\nIn the next stage, the reactions of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives 5a\u2013n with 5,12-(dimethyl)thioquinanthrenediinium 6\u00a0bis-chloride were carried out, as illustrated in Scheme 4. Similarly, to the previous reactions of bis-chloride 6 with aniline derivatives, the reaction was conducted in a pyridine environment, using a 2.5-fold excess of the aniline 1,2,3-triazole derivative 5a\u2013n in relation to bis-chloride 6. The reaction was continued up to the complete reaction of salt 6. The best yields were recorded when the reaction was carried out at 80 \u00b0C for 24 h. The course of the reaction and the structure of the products were dependent on the position of the substituents in the aniline ring of compounds 5a\u2013n. In the case of derivative 5, which contains substituents at the positions ortho and para towards the amino group, the second stage of the reaction consisting of the cyclization of quinolinio-3-thiolate 7 formed in the first stage of the reaction proceeded selectively. It led to the appropriate product 2, in which the substituents were in position 9 or 11 of the quinobenzothiazine system.\nAs shown in Scheme 5, product 7 is formed by the reaction of salt 6 with derivative 5 containing a substituent meta to the amino group. The cyclization reaction of compound 7 by nucleophilic substitution of a hydrogen atom with a thiolate sulfur atom might occur at position 2 or 6 of the ring on the phenylamino substituent. The reactions were carried out at 80 \u00b0C, leading to a mixture of compounds 2 and 8 containing substituents in position 8 or 10 of the quinobenzothiazinium system (the result of the hydrogen atom substitutions in both positions 2 and 6 of the phenyl ring). The composition of the resulting product mixtures was determined based on the signal integration in 1H-NMR spectra taken in DMSO solutions. The appropriate isomers 2 and 8 were formed in a molar ratio close to 1:3. Reaction tests of aniline 1,2,3-triazole derivatives 5b,e,h,k with bis-chloride 6 under various temperature conditions were performed. It turned out that the reactions carried out at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C had a selective course and led to the formation of pure quinobenzothiazinium isomers 2b,e,h,k that contain a substituent at position 10 of the quinobenzothiazinium system. It can be assumed that such a course of reaction could be related to the steric hindrance of the substituents in the aminophenyl group. In the case of the formation of isomers having substituents in position 8 of the quinobenzothiazine system, the cyclization of the quinoline-3-thiolate 7 proceeds by substituting a hydrogen atom between two substituents in the meta position to each other, which can be difficult at lower temperatures.\n\n## 2.2. X-ray Structural Analysis\nThe structure of compound 2 was finally determined by X-ray crystallography. A single crystal of derivative 2f was obtained by crystallization from ethanol. The X-ray structure of derivative 2f is shown in Figure 2, where molecule 2f is bent along the axis determined by the nitrogen and sulfur atoms of the thiazine ring at an angle of 145.9\u00b0. The angle formed by the C6a-S7-C7a atoms in the thiazine ring is 99.14\u00b0, while between the C11a-N12-C12a atoms, it is 121.08\u00b0. Most of the structural parameters of the tetracyclic quinobenzothiazinium system are similar to the parameters of the structure of 5-methyl-12H-quino [3,4-b][1,4]benzothiazinium chloride described earlier [9].\n\n## 2.3. In Vitro Cytotoxic Activity\nThe cytotoxic activities of aniline 1,2,3-triazole derivatives 5a,f,h,i and the 1,2,3-triazole quinobenzothiazinium derivatives 2a\u2013n against human cancer cell lines (A549, SNB-19, and T-47D) and a normal NHDF cell line are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. Measurements were conducted in triplicate (n = 3) and the data were reported with standard deviations (\u00b1std) calculated as the square root of variance.\nThe synthesized 1,2,3-triazole 2a\u2013n quinobenzothiazinium derivatives revealed much higher anticancer activity compared to the previously analyzed quinobenzothiazinium derivatives [7], which emphasized the importance of the 1,2,3-triazole system for the cytotoxic activity of compound 2.\nAt the same time, the cytotoxic activities of selected aniline 1,2,3-triazole derivatives 5a,f,h,i, which are substrates for the preparation of compound 2, were tested. Structural fragments are part of the molecule of the tetracyclic quinobenzothiazinium system, as illustrated in Scheme 6. It turned out that none of the tested cell lines, both cancerous and normal, was susceptible to the action of 5a,f,h,i derivatives. For all tested compounds, IC50 values were above 100 \u00b5M.\nIn fact, the key element determining the cytotoxic activity of compound 2 is the tetracyclic quinobenzothiazinium system. The SNB-19 cell line was the most susceptible to the effects of 2a\u2013n derivatives, and the T47D cell line was the least susceptible. The derivatives 2a\u2013c, containing an allyl substituent at the triazole ring, revealed very high activity against all tested cancer cell lines. 5-methyl-9-(1-allyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy-12H-quino [3,4-b][1,4] benzothiaziniu chloride (2a), with an IC50 range from 0.23 to 2.1 \u00b5M was the most active agent of all of the tested compounds. High anticancer activity was also demonstrated by 5-methyl-9-(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy-12H-quino [3,4-b][1,4] benzothiazinium chloride (2d) against cell line SNB-19, 5-methyl-10-(1-allyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy-12H-quino [3,4-b][1,4] benzothiazinium chloride (2b) against cell lines SNB-19 and A549 and 5-methyl-11-[1-(4-nitrobenzyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl]methoxy-12H-quino [3,4-b][1,4] benzothiazinium chloride (2i) against the T47D cell line. Low cytotoxic activity was shown by 2m,n derivatives containing a chlorophenyl substituent on the triazole ring. The 2a\u2013n derivatives revealed little cytotoxicity to normal NHDF cells. The IC50 of most of them was above 100 \u03bcM\u2014only derivatives 2a,e,f,g,j showed IC50 of 47.8, 56.6, 30.5, 27.6, and 28.7 \u03bcM against NHDF cells, respectively. It should also be noted that compounds 2a\u2013n had a stronger cytotoxic effect on the SNB-19 cell line than cisplatinum. The influence on the activity of both the nature of the substituents and their position in the quinobenzthothiazinium system was also observed. In the case of triazole substituents containing an allyl and benzyl group, the most active were derivatives containing a substituent in positions 9 and 10 of the quinobenzothiazinium system. On the other hand, derivatives with a p-nitrobenzyl and phenylthiomethyl substituent at the triazole ring do not show such a relationship.\n\n## 2.4. In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity\nAll discussed compounds were tested in vitro for their antibacterial and antimycobacterial activity; therefore, the universally susceptible collection strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were selected. Subsequently, the efficacy was evaluated against resistant clinical isolates of human and veterinary origin, i.e., against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates SA 3202, SA 630, and 63718 carrying the mecA gene [36] and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE) 342B, 368, and 725B isolates carrying the vanA gene [37]. Thus, the tested strains differed in the spectrum of antibiotic resistance, genetic equipment, and probably also the accessory genome. In addition, all compounds were evaluated in vitro against fast-growing Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 700084, and slow-growing M. marinum CAMP 5644 as a safe alternative to M. tuberculosis [38]. Activities are expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), as shown in Table 3. In order to determine whether a compound exhibits bactericidal activity against a particular test strain, it must meet the condition of MBC/MIC \u2264 4 [39]. MBC values that fulfill the above requirement (i.e., the compound is bactericidal) are reported in bold in Table 3.\nInterestingly, the insertion of the triazole motif increased anticancer activity, but on the contrary, it is counterproductive for antimicrobial activity. Unfortunately, all compounds are inactive against facultative anaerobic enterococci [40], which are known for their high resistance to disinfection procedures and antibiotics [41,42]. Per contra, the compounds substituted in position 10 of the quinobenzothiazine system with either benzyl or phenylthiomethyl, e.g., 5-methyl-10-(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy-12H-quino [3,4-b][1,4] benzothiazinium chloride (2e) and 5-methyl-10-(1-(phenylthio)methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy-12H-quino [3,4-b][4b][1,4] benzothiazinium (2k) showed the highest antistaphylococcal activities (MICs ranged from 16.3 to 65.5 \u00b5M). From the point of view of antistaphylococcal activity, substitution with phenylthiomethyl appears to be more advantageous since the entire subseries were active. The acceptable values of activity against staphylococci were also revealed for molecule 2m with a substitution at position 9 with chlorophenyl. Thus, it seems that the antistaphylococcal activity is primarily determined by the substituent on the triazole ring and subsequently by the position of the substituent on the quinobenzothiazine system, with position 11 and the allyl chain being the least favorable. On the other hand, the most antimycobacterially active agents were the chlorinated derivatives 2m,n (MICs ranged from 8.19 to 32.7 \u00b5M), followed by 2j\u2013l (substitution with phenylthiomethyl), whereby substitution at position 9 of the tetracyclic skeleton again appears to be advantageous.\nOverall, it can be summarized that rough SAR requirements for anticancer and antimicrobial activity go against each other. The anticancer activity is more pronounced than the antimicrobial one, which can be understood as a specific benefit when the drug is simultaneously able to suppress related infections arising as a result of immunodeficiency caused by cytostatic treatment. In this context, it should be noted that all of the active compounds demonstrated bactericidal activity.\nSince the compounds showed more antimycobacterial than antibacterial activity, an attempt was made to estimate the mechanism of action of these compounds. Since M. smegmatis is particularly useful in the study of basic cellular processes of particular importance to pathogenic mycobacteria [43], a standard MTT assay with the most active derivatives was performed with it. The MTT assay can be used to assess cell growth by measuring respiration. For example, the antitubercular drug bedaquiline is a strong inhibitor of mycobacterial respiration [44]. The respiratory activity of bacterial cells (which is finally reflected in their viability) of less than 70% after exposure to the MIC values for each tested compound is considered as a positive result of this assay. This low level of cell oxidative metabolism indicates inhibition of cell growth by inhibition of respiration [45,46]. The lowest multiples of the MIC values by which the inhibition of M. smegmatis viability (%) greater than 70% was achieved are reported in Table 4. It can be concluded that evaluated compounds 2h,m,n demonstrated a decrease in viability <70% at its MIC value, which suggests that their mechanism of action may be connected with inhibition of the respiratory chain.\n\n## 2.5. Similarity-Related Property Assessment\nThe clustering potency of the descriptor-based data can be examined by tracing the (dis)similarities between objects (molecules 2a\u2013n) in the multidimensional (mD) variable space generated by Dragon 6.0 software [47]. From the initial number of selected parameters (4885), all columns with constant or nearly constant values (standard deviation < 10\u22124) and with missing values have been excluded at the preprocessing stage, resulting in the final set of 2789 descriptors. Thus, the distance-guided property evaluation was performed using the principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) on a pool of 2789 variables, including topological, constitutional, 2D/3D, physicochemical variables. The software-retrieved descriptors were then organized into matrix X14\u00d72789 with rows representing compounds 2a\u2013n (objects) and columns representing numerical parameters (descriptors). The resulting matrix was centered and standardized due to the calculated parameters\u2019 range varying noticeably. PCA is a projection method that is designed to model multivariate data with a relatively small number of so-called principal components. Principal components (PCs) are constructed as a linear combination of original variables in order to maximize the description of data variance; therefore, the number of relevant PCs was selected, taking into account the percentage of the modeled data variance. The first four PCs account for 86.4% of the total data variance, whereas the first two PCs describe approximately 65.2%, respectively. The score plot with the projection of 1,2,3-triazol-quinobenzothiazine derivatives 2a\u2013n on the plane PC1 vs. PC2 color-coded according to the experimental TLC lipophilicity is presented in Figure 3.\nAs a matter of fact, the analyzed 1,2,3-triazol-quinobenzothiazine derivatives (2a\u2013n) are grouped in three main clusters according to the first principal component (PC1). Not surprisingly, the derivatives 2a\u2013c, containing an allyl substituent at the triazole ring, compose the first group with PC1 > 50, while molecules with the nitrobenzyl group are separated from the remaining ones (PC1 < \u221250). The rest of the benzene-based analogs are clustered together along \u221220 < PC1 < 20 with higher values of the empirical TLC lipophilic values, as shown in Figure 3. Interestingly, the structural dissimilarity between the investigated molecules is also observed along the second principal component (PC2), where all ortho-substituted derivatives 2c,f,i,l are grouped together with PC2 < \u221220 and separated from meta/para-based analogs (PC2 > \u221210), respectively.\nOverall, the exploratory HCA procedure generates the suboptimal clustering pattern of objects/molecules that is mainly dependent on the clusters\u2019 linkage method employed [48]. Unfortunately, in-depth interpretability of the multidimensional data is impeded in the original descriptor space; therefore, the mutual (dis)similarities are illustrated as a 2D dendrogram produced in the Euclidean-based distance with the Ward linkage algorithm\u2014the OX axis presents the order of objects or parameters, whereas the OY one shows the (dis)similarity between them. The dendrogram presented in Figure 4 confirms our previous PCA findings (see Figure 3), where derivatives 2a\u2013c with an allyl substituent at the triazole ring form cluster A that differs from collection B with the ortho/meta/para nitrobenzyl-based isomers 2g,h,i. Likewise, the remaining benzene-containing analogs are grouped within cluster C, which is noticeably characterized by higher values of the experimental TLC lipophilic values, as shown in the color-coded map in Figure 4. Unfortunately, there are no evident SAR (structure-activity) relationships; however, molecules within clusters A and B are generally marked by slightly higher values of the cytotoxic activities against human cancer cell lines (A549, SNB-19, and T-47D) compared to the remaining ones (cluster C).\n\n## 2.6. ClogP Estimation versus Experimental Lipophilicity\nUnderstanding lipophilicity and its modulation has been recognized as a crucial factor in the description of both the pharmacokinetic (ADMET) and pharmacodynamic aspects of drug-receptor/enzyme interactions; therefore, the accurate and efficient measurement of experimental logP values is an important requirement in drug design. Alternatively, using empirical methods, some lipophilicity descriptors (clogP) have been proposed using mainly in silico predictive models. It is possible that some methods for theoretical calculation of lipophilicity might be more or less suitable for specific/heterogeneous series of compounds analyzed; thus, a variety of approaches should be employed in a consensus methodology and subsequently compared with the existing empirical data. Hence, the numerical approximation of clogP values for the examined series of 1,2,3-triazol-quinobenzothiazine derivatives 2a\u2013n was performed via a set of in silico logP estimators, including AlogPS, Molinspirations, Osiris, HyperChem 7.0, Sybyl-X, MarvinSketch 15, Dragon6.0, XlogP3, respectively. In order to compare the estimated clogP with the empirical lipophilic values, the thin-layer chromatography method (TLC) was used. In practice, the theoretically approximated partition coefficients (clogP) were (inter-)correlated with each other and cross-compared with the empirically specified logPTLC parameters, as shown in Figure 5.\nA relatively good correlation (ranging from r = 0.57 to r = 0.91) was observed between the generated clogP and the experimental lipophilic logPTLC values for all used clogP predictors, with r > 0.90 recorded for the HyperChem and Sybyl-X programs. The averaged clogP values over the set of programs produced a value of r = 0.91, whereas the median resulted in r = 0.84 with the empirical data. Moreover, the iterative variable elimination procedure (IVE-PLS) was applied on the integrated clogP matrix (X14\u00d710) and logPTLC parameter, indicating clogPS, Sybyl-X, AlogP, and XlogP2 estimators as valid contributors to the linear QSPR model in namely consensus lipophilicity determination [49]. In consequence, the averaged values of the indicated clogP predictors were correlated with logPTLC values, resulting in r = 0.84, because not only the best intercorrelated logP estimators were chosen. It should be emphasized that some variations in the clogP specification resulted probably from different computational algorithms (atom/fragment- or descriptor-based) implemented in the software and/or the training data used at the training step; therefore, the consensus approach seems advisable.\n\n## 3.1. Chemistry\nMelting points are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ascend 600 spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). The following 2D experiments were employed to assign the structures: 1H-13C gradient selected HSQC and HMBC sequences. Standard experimental conditions and standard Bruker programs were used. The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectral data are provided relative to the TMS signal at 0.0 ppm. HR mass spectra were recorded with the Bruker Impact II (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA).\n\n## 3.1.1. Synthesis of Propargiloxy-5-Methylo-12\nA total of 1 mmol of the corresponding propargyloxy-5-methyl-12H-quino[3,4-b][1,4]benzothiazinium chloride 1a\u2013c was dissolved in 50 mL of water at 50 \u00b0C. The resulting solution was filtered from solid residues. Then, 10 mL of 5% NaHCO3 aqueous solution was added dropwise to the solution while stirring. The resulting precipitate was suction-filtered and washed with water (3 \u00d7 10 mL). The obtained products were dried in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride.\n1. 9-propargyloxy-5-methyl-5H-quino [3,4-b][1,4]benzothiazine (3a): Yield: 90%; 1H NMR (DMSOd-6, 600 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 3.45 (s, 3H, CH3), 3.57\u20133.59 (m, 1H, CH), 4.68\u20134.75 (m, 2H, CH2), 6.35\u20136.40 (m, 1H, Harom), 6.48\u20136.53 (m, 1H, Harom), 6.70\u20136.76 (m, 1H, Harom), 6.97 (s, 1H, H6), 7.16\u20137.24 (m, 2H, Harom), 7.45\u20137.52 (m, 1H, Harom), 8.09\u20138.13 (m, 1H, Harom); 13C NMR (DMSOd-6, 150.9 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 40.52 (CH3), 56.06 (CH2), 78.77, 79.68, 102.11, 112.33, 113.70, 115.67, 121.52, 121.92, 123.78, 124.79, 127.62, 131.74, 132.64, 139.01, 140.84, 151.73, 155.44; ESI-HRMS Calcd for C19H15N2OS ([M + H]+): 319.0905, found: 319.0901.\n2. 10-propargyloxy-5-methyl-5H-quino [3,4-b][1,4]benzothiazine (3b): Yield: 95%; 1H NMR (DMSOd-6, 600 MHz), \u03b4 (ppm): 3.51 (s, 3H, CH3), 3.55\u20133.59 (m, 1H, CH), 4.68\u20134.72 (m, 2H, CH2), 6.41\u20136.45 (m, 2H, Harom), 6.56\u20136.61 (m, 1H, Harom), 7.07 (s, 1H, H6), 7.21\u20137.27 (m, 1H, Harom), 7.28\u20137.31 (m, 1H, Harom), 7.51\u20137.56 (m, 1H, Harom), 8.16\u20138.21 (m, 1H, Harom)",
