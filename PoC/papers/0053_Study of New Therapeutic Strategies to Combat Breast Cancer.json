  "abstract": "Cancer is a disease that affects and kills millions of people worldwide. Breast cancer, especially, has a high incidence and mortality, and is challenging to treat. Due to its high impact on the health sector, oncological therapy is the subject of an intense and very expensive research. To improve this therapy and reduce its costs, strategies such as drug repurposing and drug combinations have been extensively studied. Drug repurposing means giving new usefulness to drugs which are approved for the therapy of various diseases, but, in this case, are not approved for cancer therapy. On the other hand, the purpose of combining drugs is that the response that is obtained is more advantageous than the response obtained by the single drugs. Using drugs with potential to be repurposed, combined with 5-fluorouracil, the aim of this project was to investigate whether this combination led to therapeutic benefits, comparing with the isolated drugs. We started with a screening of the most promising drugs, with verapamil and itraconazole being chosen. Several cellular viability studies, cell death and proliferation studies, mainly in MCF-7 cells (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7, human breast adenocarcinoma cells) were performed. Studies were also carried out to understand the effect of the drugs at the level of possible therapeutic resistance, evaluating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Combining all the results, the conclusion is that the combination of verapamil and itraconazole with 5-fluorouracil had benefits, mainly by decreasing cell viability and proliferation. Furthermore, the combination of itraconazole and 5-fluorouracil seemed to be the most effective, being an interesting focus in future studies.",

  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nCancer is the second-leading cause of death behind heart disease [1], accounting for an estimation of 9.6 million deaths in 2018 [2].\nWhen dealing with this disease, there are three important priorities, which are, in order of importance: prevention, early detection and total eradication. The treatment of cancer, particularly, is a very complex issue, with three usual modes: surgery, radiotherapy and pharmacotherapy [3].\nConcerning pharmacotherapy, the ideal drug is one that selectively kills the neoplastic cells, minimizing adverse effects. However, the differences between normal and neoplastic cells reside, usually, in a quantitative way, such as greater or lesser activation of signaling pathways. Therefore, pharmacotherapy of cancer is difficult to achieve in a totally successful way [4]. Nevertheless, survival of oncological patients has improved significantly in the last years, mainly because of multidisciplinary care, improved chemotherapeutic agents, introduction of targeted therapy, and the incorporation of palliative care services [5]. However, despite the advances mentioned above, many patients still fail therapy, explained by the presence of an intratumoral heterogeneity and several drug resistance mechanisms, such as deregulation of apoptosis, activation of prosurvival signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [6]. Intense pharmacological research is being made about oncological therapy, originating an explosion of costs. Despite this big investment, there is little output for a huge pharma research and development spending. Thus, there is a requirement for more effective cancer drugs. To face this problem, an interesting approach named drug repurposing is being increasingly applied [7]. Highlighting the importance of this approach, the global market for drug repurposing reached \u20ac20.7 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach \u20ac26.6 billion by 2020 [8]. Additionally, another important response to the problems in cancer therapy encompasses the use of drug combination therapies [9].\nDrug repurposing is a methodology to identify a new indication for already existent drugs. It allows lower costs and a shorter time until approval of the drug, than developing a drug de novo, because information regarding side effects, pharmacokinetics and interaction with other drugs has been collected [10]. Cytostatic and/or cytotoxic activity within a wide range of drug classes other than cancer has been demonstrated in several studies. Therefore, the study of the arsenal of drugs approved for non-cancer indications might offer effective treatment options for cancer patients. Commonly, ideal drugs for repurposing share several characteristics: they should be well-known drugs, often available as generics, the toxicology profile of the drug must be good, there should have a plausible mechanism of action, relevant for the condition in question, and evidence of efficacy at physiological dosing [9]. Many currently used drugs have, at least, some actions that may be useful in cancer treatment. Particularly, a lot of off-patent drugs have shown some evidence of anticancer effects, in which about 50% are supported by relevant human data and 16% are supported by data from at least one positive clinical trial [11]. Briefly, for oncologic purposes, drugs like aspirin, itraconazole, verapamil, chloroquine and all-trans retinoic acid have shown anticancer activity in, at least, one randomized clinical trial [12,13].\nConcerning drug combination approach, it is known that a disease is interpreted as a set of molecular pathways that interconnect, having a bigger susceptibility to the simultaneous action of several drugs. This makes possible to study drug combinations in greater depth [14]. Combining drugs has several advantages: decreased toxicity, better efficacy, decreased dosage at an equal or increased level of efficacy, and counter drug resistance [15]. Due to these advantages, drug combinations represent an interesting and increasingly used approach that has become a standard for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, such as cancer and infectious diseases [14]. Particularly in cancer, numerous clinical trials testing combinations that include chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, hormonal therapies, molecularly targeted therapies, and immunotherapies are being carried out [16], with a crescent focus on the combination of cytotoxic chemicals and biotherapies [17].\nCombining repurposed pharmaceutical agents with other chemotherapeutic agents has also shown promising results, useful when traditional anticancer monotherapy has failed to provide a safe and tolerable treatment for cancer patients [18]. An example of these kinds of combinations is nitroglycerin in combination with the chemotherapeutics vinorelbine and cisplatin. In this case, one randomized Phase II trial demonstrated improved overall survival of patients with non-squamous cell lung cancer [18].\nBreast cancer is a collection of breast diseases that have distinct histopathologies, genetic, genomic variations, and clinical outcomes [19], being the second most common cancer worldwide, the most frequent cancer in women and the fifth cause of death from cancer overall. In the past two decades, the rates of breast cancer mortality have declined by approximately 30%, with corresponding improvements in five-year overall survival rates to 90%. However, despite these advances, metastatic breast cancer remains a challenge to treat, with an estimated five-year overall survival rate of only 23% [20].\nThe choices of treatment regimens for breast cancer is a very complex issue, being difficult to have a universally accepted treatment, since each case is a case and the choice of the best therapy should be tailored to each person. Thus, a lot of expertise is necessary to evaluate the best therapy for each case [21].\nFor early-stage breast cancer, surgery is considered the gold-standard treatment [22]. On the other side, the adjuvant treatment\u2019s main goal is to treat metastatic disease. This treatment consists of radiation therapy and systemic therapy (including a variety of chemotherapeutic, hormonal and biologic agents) [23]. There are a lot of approved drugs for breast cancer and, in addition, there are a great variety of drugs that have the potential to be repurposed for its treatment [24]. However, to date, no repurposed drugs have been approved for the treatment of this kind of cancer. An example of a potential repurposed drug is the beta-blocker propranolol. A study showed that this beta blockade reduced tumor proliferation by 66%, in early stage breast cancer, by accessing Ki67. Chloroquine is another example, with very promising results in breast cell lines and Phase I trials, either alone or in combination with other drugs [25].\nDespite a lot of approved drugs and potential drugs to repurpose, breast cancer remains a major healthcare issue. Highly qualified healthcare providers are necessary for proper surgical treatment. Additionally, advanced treatment approaches that involve radiation are difficult to achieve in developing countries, particularly. Adequate systemic treatments, management of potential severe effects and new targeted therapies are costly, and the most sophisticated treatments require advanced and costly pathology. In addition, the problem of drug resistance, transversal to most of the cancer types, remains an important issue of study and combat [26].\nThus, this project aimed to investigate the effect of drugs with potential to be repurposed for breast cancer therapy, in combination with an already used drug in this type of therapy (5-fluorouracil), so that the combination of these drugs presented benefits, when compared to the single drugs of the combination.\n5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was chosen as the reference drug of this study, mainly because it is a potential drug to be used in combination regimens in breast cancer therapeutics, with the major aim of improving its efficacy, as well as its known toxicological profile. It is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound with a structure similar to that of the pyrimidine molecules of DNA and RNA. This drug and their metabolites are responsible for RNA and DNA damage, acting on S phase of cell cycle [27].\nStudies addressing combinations of drugs using drugs with non-cancer indications have shown positive results in relation to cancer therapy, not exclusively for breast cancer, but also for other kinds of cancer [28]. By integrating all the obtained results, it was notorious that the chosen drug combinations showed a tendency to be more effective than the most effective drug of each combination. Possibly, these drug combinations may act primarily in the arrest of cell proliferation. Also, it is important to highlight that the collective of all results pointed out that the combination of 5-FU and itraconazole was the most promising combination.\n\n## 2.1. Drug Solutions\nFor the treatment of cells with the several drugs under study (5-FU, verapamil, itraconazole, isoniazid, tacrine, aspirin, cimetidine, chloroquine, losartan, all from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich Quimica, S.L., Sintra, Portugal) and pravastatin, from Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), all the compounds were dissolved in autoclaved water, except itraconazole, that was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), since it did not present solubility in water. A stock solution of each compound was prepared at a concentration of 10 mM and, except for itraconazole, two stock solutions with a concentration of 25 mM and 50 mM were prepared, because this drug was dissolved in DMSO, which has significant toxicity to cells after a percentage of 0.2%, a percentage that was never exceeded in this work. All these stock solutions were conserved on the freezer at \u221226 \u00b0C. Depending on the purpose of the assay, test compounds were used in concentrations that range from 1 \u03bcM to 100 \u03bcM, dissolved in culture medium right before contact with cells. The respective concentrations used in each assay are presented in the Results section. The test compounds applied to the cells vary with the purpose of the experiment, also specified in the above-mentioned section.\n\n## 2.2. Cell Culture\nThe experimental work was carried out mainly in the MCF-7 cell line (ATCC, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). Additional experiments were carried out in MCF-10A (ATCC\u2014American Type Culture Collection). MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 95% of air and 5% of CO2. MCF-7 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% of a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin (1000 U/mL; 10 mg/mL). MCF-10A were cultivated in DMEM/F-12, supplemented with the same supplements described above plus 2 \u03bcg/mL of human insulin (NovoNordisk, Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark), 20 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 1 \u03bcM of hydrocortisone. For maintenance, the cells were cultured in a monolayer, being subcultured 2\u20133 days per week, and 1 day per week in the case of MCF-10A, the last cell line growing slowly. All the experiments were carried out with cells to 70\u201380% confluence.\n\n## 2.3. MTT Reduction Assay\nMCF-7 and MCF-10A cells were plated in 96-well plates with a seeding density of 3.0 \u00d7 104 cells/mL, maintained at an incubator at 37 \u00b0C, for 24 h. After this time, different treatments were added to the cells at different concentrations, for 48 h or 72 h, depending on the purpose of the experiment. The cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C during the referred time and, after that, the cell medium was removed and 100 \u03bcL of (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution (0.5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well. Then, the cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h in a light-protected manner. At the end of this time, MTT solution was removed and 100 \u03bcL/well of DMSO was added, with the purpose of solubilization of formazan crystals. The last step consisted of absorbance readings at 570 nm in an automated microplate reader (Sinergy HT, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).\n\n## 2.4. Immunocytochemistry\nMCF-7 cells were seeded in T25 cm2 flasks with a density of 4.7 \u00d7 104 cells/mL, converted from the density used in 96-well plates (3.0 \u00d7 104 cells/mL). After that, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the different test compounds were added and acted for 48 h. After this time, the cells were included in cell blocks (one for each different treatment) and different slides were made from each block. Then, deparaffinization by submerging the slides twice in xylene was performed, for 5 min each time, followed by hydration in alcohol at decreasing concentrations (100%, 95% and 70% alcohol) until rinsing in water. After that, antigen retrieval (unmasking) was performed by using a Retrieval Solution (10% in water), 20 min in a water-bath at 100 \u00b0C. The next step consisted in endogenous peroxidase block, by incubation of the slides in a Peroxidase Block Solution for 5 min. Then, the slides were washed twice in TBS for 5 min. Incubation with protein block for 5 min followed, and the slides were washed in TBS 2\u00d7 for 5 min. Afterwards, the slides were incubated with the mouse antibodies anti-cytokeratin (pan) (1:1200 in BSA 5%), anti-E-cadherin (1:50 in BSA 5%) and anti-vimentin (1:500 in BSA 5%), overnight, at 4 \u00b0C. The slides were washed twice in TBS, for 5 min and the post primary was added, following an incubation time of 30 min. Once again, the slides were washed twice in TBS, for 5 min. After that, they were incubated for 30 min with the Polymer, washed twice in TBS for 5 min and, to each slide, 150 \u03bcL of a solution of 50 \u03bcL of DAB Chromogen to 1 mL of DAB Substrate Buffer was added to each slide. Finally, the slides were rinsed in water, counterstained in hematoxylin during 1 min, washed again for 5 to 10 min, dehydrated (at increasing concentrations of alcohol, 70%, 95% and 2\u00d7 100%), diaphanized (2\u00d7 in xylene), and the sections were mounted. The slides were observed on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, coupled to a digital camera (Nikon Digital Sight DS-Fi2, Tokyo, Japan). The images were treated with Imaging Software NIS-Elements AR Version 4.30.0 (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).\n\n## 2.5. Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide Staining\nMCF-7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates with a seeding density of 1.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mL, incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. After this time, the different treatments were added to the cells that were incubated for 3 or 8 h. Then, cells were trypsinized, washed with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS, 2%FBS), centrifuged for 5 min, 400\u00d7 g, and stained with the eBioscience Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) (Waltham, MA, USA), as follows: Annexin V FITC (1 \u03bcL per well) in Binding Buffer (50 \u03bcL per well), 15 min at room temperature, in the dark. Then, cells were transferred to a test tube and 2 \u03bcL of propidium iodide (PI) were added to each sample, 5 min before analysis in a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Epics XL and BD FACSCanto II; Brea, CA, USA and, San Jose, CA, USA, respectively). The acquired data was analyzed using FlowJo (V10) analysis software (Ashland, OR, USA).\n\n## 2.6. CFSE Labeling of Cells\nMCF-7 cells were resuspended in PBS with 0.1% BSA at a density of 2.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mL. The CellTraceTM carboxyfluorescein succinimydil ester (CFSE) Cell Proliferation Kit (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for cell labelling. A CFSE stock solution (5 mM in DMSO) stored at \u221220 \u00b0C was thawed and diluted in PBS with 0.1% BSA to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Next, 2.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mL were labelled by the addition of the same volume of the prepared CFSE staining solution and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min. The staining solution was neutralized with three volumes of cold complete medium (DMEM, 10% FBS) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Then, cells were centrifuged at 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed one more time with complete RPMI medium. The cell pellet was resuspended in complete medium at a density of 1.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mL and cells were seeded in 96-well plates for 3 h. After that, the medium was aspired and test compounds, dissolved in the culture medium, were added to cells, that were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for approximately 72 h. The final step consisted of washing and resuspension of cultured cells in HBSS (2% FBS). Five min before reading, 2 \u03bcL of PI were added to each cytometer tube (that represents each condition) for dead cell exclusion. Finally, cell proliferation was determined by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter Epics XL, Brea, CA, USA) and the data was analyzed using FlowJo (V10) analysis software.\n\n## 2.7. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed in all experiments, only in the case of a number of independent experiments equal or bigger than 3 (n \u2265 3). The results are expressed as arithmetic mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM), except in one case, where results are expressed as arithmetic mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), explicit in the subtitles of the graphs. Differences between treated cells and corresponding untreated control were tested using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Differences between the drug combination and the respective individual drug of that combination that produces more advantageous effects in terms of cell viability reduction were tested by Student\u2019s t-test. Differences were considered to be significant when p value < 0.05. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s test and Student\u2019s t-test were performed by using SigmaPlot 12.0 (San Jose, CA, USA) and GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA), respectively. It is important to note that, for all experiments, no differences were observed between control with/without DMSO.\n\n## 3.1. Drug Screening in MCF-7 Cells\nBased on several studies about potential drugs to repurpose [10,12,29,30] and interests of the investigational group, nine drugs, each in combination with the reference drug (5-FU), were tested in MCF-7 cell line, in order to make an initial screening of potential drugs to be used in combination with 5-FU. Each drug was used in a concentration of 50 \u03bcM, thus, in a ratio of 1:1 when combined with 5-FU, being in contact with cells for 72 h. The results were obtained by MTT methodology (Figure 1).\nIn this particular screening assay, the criterion for the choice of drug combinations for the continuity of the project was that the combination of drugs was more advantageous in terms of reduction of cell viability than the two drugs in the combination, where the potentially repurposed drug was more efficient than 5-FU. The combination was more effetive than drugs separated.\nAnalyzing the obtained results, it was possible to observe that chloroquine was more effective in terms of cell viability reduction than all the other drugs and drug combinations (6.5 \u00b1 0.4% of cellular viability). Thus, as the aim of this work was to study a beneficial drug combination in comparison with individual drugs of the combination, chloroquine was excluded from the next steps. Importantly, the combinations of 5-FU with aspirin, losartan, cimetidine, pravastatin, isoniazid and tacrine did not show an advantage in terms of reduction of cell viability, relative to both single drugs of the combination, being also excluded from this study. However, two drug combinations were advantageous: 5-FU combined with verapamil and itraconazole, chosen for the continuity of this project. The exposure of MCF-7 cells to 5-FU combined with verapamil and itraconazole, for 72 h of contact with cells, resulted in a cell viability reduction (in comparison with the drug with more effect on viability reduction of that combination, the potential repurposed drug) of 23% and 17%, respectively. With 5-FU + verapamil, cell viability was 12.1 \u00b1 4.4%, whereas with 5-FU + itraconazole was 24.5 \u00b1 5.2%. In both cases, the differences were considered statistically significant.\n\n## 3.2. Comparison of Cellular Viability between MCF-7 and MCF-10A Cell Lines\nTo compare the effects of the chosen drug combinations in a tumoral cell line (MCF-7) and a non-tumoral cell line (MCF-10A), both cell lines were exposed to 50 \u03bcM of each drug, for 72 h. The results, for each cell line, were obtained by MTT methodology (Figure 2).\nIt was observed that, in general, the drugs had no or very little effects on the viability of MCF-10A cells, contrasting with the effects on viability of MCF-7 cells. Taking into account the two combinations, 5-FU combined with itraconazole led to the lowest values of cell viability in MCF-10A, 63.6 \u00b1 8.5%, whereas 5-FU combined with verapamil led to similar values of cellular viability: 86.3 \u00b1 3.2%. All the single drugs and combinations led to effects on cell viability reduction of MCF-7 cells much more pronounced, compared with MCF-10A cell line.\n\n## 3.3. Concentration-Effect Curves and IC\nIn order to determine the IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 5-FU, verapamil and itraconazole on the viability of MCF-7 cells, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of these drugs (1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 \u03bcM), converted in logarithm of concentrations. The drugs were in contact with cells for a time of 48 h, and cellular viability was determined by MTT reduction assay. The obtained values allowed the creation of concentration-effect curves (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5) to calculate IC50 values (Table 1).\nThe IC50 of the drugs was calculated by using the normalized data (between 0% and 100%). Thus, it was defined as the concentration of the drug that inhibits 50% of cellular viability. However, this method of calculation of IC50 has limitations, as reported in the Discussion Section. This value was calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 software and the option \u201cAnalyze Data, nonlinear regression (Curve fit)\u201d.\n\n## 3.4. Effect of 5-FU Fixed in Its IC\nThe IC50 value obtained for 5-FU (approximately 11.8 \u03bcM) was fixed, and the concentration of the other two drugs varied by values around the obtained IC50 value for each drug (approximately 29 and 6 \u03bcM for verapamil and itraconazole, respectively). It is important to note that the IC50 value obtained for itraconazole was initially 6 \u03bcM and this was the value of IC50 considered to this drug. However, in a final phase of the work, the experiment of generating a concentration-effect curve for itraconazole was repeated and a new value of IC50 (2.08 \u03bcM) was obtained.\nThe drugs were in contact with cells for a time of 48 h and cellular viability was determined by MTT reduction assay (Figure 6).\nThe lowest values of cellular viability were obtained for concentrations of 55 and 3 \u03bcM, for verapamil and itraconazole, (10.4 \u00b1 0.6%; 34.9 \u00b1 2.7%) respectively. A tendency of lower values of cellular viability with an increase of verapamil concentration was observed, whereas with itraconazole, it seemed that above 3 \u03bcM, the concentration of the drug had little or no effect on reduction of the cellular viability. Clearly, verapamil appeared to be the drug which was more affected by differences in concentration.\n\n## 3.5. Effect of Concentrations of 11.8, 55 and 3 \u03bcM of 5-FU, Verapamil and Itraconazole, Respectively, on the Viability of MCF-7 Cells, for 48 and 72 h\nFurther, we tested the effect of 5-FU, verapamil, itraconazole and the respective combinations of the last two drugs with 5-FU on the viability of MCF-7 cells, using 5-FU in a concentration of 11.8 \u03bcM (IC50 value), and verapamil and itraconazole in a concentration of 55 and 3 \u03bcM, respectively, acting on cells for a time of 48 h or 72 h (Figure 7). The concentrations used for the repurposed drugs were selected taking into account the experiment described in Section 3.4, being the concentrations that gave lower values of cellular viability in combination with 5-FU fixed on its IC50 value.\nAnalyzing the obtained results, for 48 h-treatment with the drugs, it was concluded that the drug combinations seemed to be only slightly advantageous, compared with the single drug with more effect on the reduction of cell viability of each combination. In the case of verapamil combined with 5-FU, the single drug with more effect on cellular viability reduction was 5-FU, with values of cell viability of 71.0 \u00b1 2.1% (combination) and 76.9 \u00b1 2.6% (5-FU). In the case of itraconazole combined with 5-FU, values of 35.8 \u00b1 1.1% of cellular viability contrasted with values of 41.4 \u00b1 2.2% of itraconazole, the single drug of the combination with more effect on cellular viability reduction. Thus, even though there were no notable differences, there was a tendency of the combination to be more effective than the single drug with more effect on the reduction of cell viability of that combination.\nFor 72 h, it was possible to observe that the combinations of 5-FU + verapamil (49.7 \u00b1 2.5% of cellular viability) and 5-FU + itraconazole (32.5 \u00b1 5.5% of cellular viability), compared with the single drug of each combination with more effect on the reduction of cell viability, with 7% and 11%, respectively, keeping the same tendency above mentioned. It was also noted that when comparing different time points (48 vs. 72 h), the drugs and combinations reduced cell viability more markedly at 72 h.\nAt both 48 and 72 h, the lowest values of cellular viability were obtained with 5-FU + itraconazole. The increase of independent experiments offered a strong probability of observation of statistically significant differences, since there is a clear tendency of advantageous effects of drug combinations (in both 48 and 72 h), relative to individual drugs.\n\n## 3.6. Effect of 50 \u03bcM of Each Drug on the Viability of MCF-7 Cells, for 48 and 72 h\nThe effect of 5-FU, verapamil and itraconazole and the respective combinations of the last two drugs with 5-FU on the viability of MCF-7 was tested, using all the drugs in a concentration of 50 \u03bcM, the same concentration used in the initial screening assay. The drugs were in contact with cells for 48 h and 72 h (Figure 8).\nFor 48 h of actuation of the drugs and combinations, it was observed that the two combinations, compared with the single drug, with more effect on the reduction of cell viability with 3% (in the case of verapamil combined with 5-FU) and 6% (in the case of itraconazole combined with 5-FU). For 72 h, this reduction was 23% and 17% respectively.\nAt 48 h of drug actuation, the lowest values of cellular viability were obtained with 5-FU + itraconazole (47.9 \u00b1 6.5% of cell viability). On the other hand, at 72h, not only higher differences between the most effective single drug of the combination and the respective combination, but also the lowest values of cellular viability were achieved with the 5-FU + verapamil (12.1 \u00b1 2.2% of cell viability). It was also noticeable that, when comparing different time points (48 vs. 72 h), all the drug combinations and single drugs reduced cell viability more markedly at 72 h than at 48 h.\n\n## 3.7. Comparison of Different Concentrations of the Drugs on the Viability of MCF-7 Cells, at 48 and 72 h\nThe results presented below represent the results obtained in Section 3.5 and Section 3.6, with the purpose of comparing the different concentrations tested in different time points (48h and 72 h) (Figure 9).\nAnalyzing the results obtained for 48 h-treatment, it was observed that the different concentrations did not produce very different effects in the case of 5-FU and 5-FU combined with verapamil. On the other side, in the case of verapamil, itraconazole and 5-FU combined with itraconazole, with concentrations of 50 \u03bcM, it was possible to observe that cell viability was less reduced.\nFor 72 h-treatment, in general, there was marked reduction in cellular viability, compared with 48 h. Once again, it was observed that the different concentrations did not produce very different effects, except in the case of verapamil and 5-FU combined with verapamil, in which concentrations of 50 \u03bcM led to an increase in cell viability reduction.\nTaking into account all the different concentrations and time points, the drug combination that appeared to be more effective in terms of cell viability reduction was 5-FU + verapamil in a concentration of 50 \u03bcM of each drug, at 72 h (12.1 \u00b1 2.2%). However, in all other conditions, 5-FU + itraconazole seemed to be the more effective drug combination, leading to reduced cellular viability values.\n\n## 3.8. Evaluation of the Transition from an Epithelial to a Mesenchymal Phenotype, in MCF-7 Cells\nImmunocytochemistry was used to assess the epithelial markers cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and E-cadherin, and the mesenchymal marker, vimentin, aiming at evaluating whether the resistant cells evolved from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state. MCF-7 cells were treated with 5-FU, verapamil, itraconazole, and the respective combinations of the last two drugs with 5-FU, acting on cells for a 48 h-period. 5-FU was used in a concentration of 11.8 \u03bcM and verapamil and itraconazole were used in a concentration of 55 and 3 \u03bcM, respectively. The obtained images are presented below (Figure 10).\nIt was possible to observe that, in all conditions, the cells were positively stained for the epithelial markers, AE1/AE3 and E-cadherin, and negatively marked for the mesenchymal marker, vimentin. Other findings were the presence of fewer cells, damaged cells, cells with vacuoles and dead cells. These findings will be discussed in the next section.\n\n## 3.9. Analysis of Cell Death in MCF-7 Cells, by Annexin V/PI Staining\nIn order to understand the mechanism by which drug combinations act, we further tested them on the death of MCF-7 cells, using Annexin V/PI staining evaluated using flow cytometry. 5-Fluorouracil was used in a concentration of 11.8 \u03bcM (IC50 value) and verapamil and itraconazole were used in a concentration of 55 and 3 \u03bcM (with lower value from Figure 6), respectively, ",
