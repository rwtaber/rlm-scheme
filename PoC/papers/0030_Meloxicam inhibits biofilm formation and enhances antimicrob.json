  "abstract": "Microbial biofilms are communities of surface-adhered cells enclosed in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances. Bacterial cells in biofilm are 10~1,000-fold more resistant to antimicrobials than the planktonic cells. Burgeoning antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm has necessitated the development of antimicrobial agents. Here, we have investigated the antibiofilm effect of meloxicam against P.\u00a0aeruginosaPAO1 and its potential mechanisms. Further, we have explored whether meloxicam could enhance the susceptibility of bacterial biofilms to treatment with conventional antimicrobials. Here, we found that meloxicam could significantly inhibit PAO1 biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner at the concentration without influence on planktonic cell growth. Meloxicam could also significantly inhibit the motilities, production of extracellular matrix, and expression of quorum sensing-related genes and virulence factors of PAO1. Furthermore, synergistic interaction was observed when meloxicam combined with tetracycline, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ceftazidime, and DNase at subminimal inhibitory concentrations against PAO1 bioiflm. Collectively, our study lays the foundation for further investigation of repurposing meloxicam as a topical antibiofilm agent to treat P.\u00a0aeruginosa biofilm-related infections.",

  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nBiofilm is a community of bacteria that are attached to a substratum or surface (Chen, Yu, & Sun, 2013), typically consist of densely packed, multispecies populations of cells, encased in a self\u2010synthesized polymeric matrix, such as exopolysaccharides (EPS), extracellular protein, and extracellular DNA (eDNA), and attached to a tissue or surface (Costerton et\u00a0al., 1987; Stoodley, Cargo, Rupp, Wilson, & Klapper, 2002). Cells embedded in biofilm are up to 1,000 times more resistant to conventional antibiotics compared to their counterparts (Mah & O'Toole, 2001). Biofilms have also been implicated as being involved in many different chronic bacterial infections, such as cystic fibrosis and chronic wound infection. Moreover, the bacteria could also cause infections in indwelling medical devices, such as catheters and artificial joint implants (H\u00f8iby et\u00a0al., 2015).\nPseudomonas aeruginosa has become one of the most important model organisms for the study of biofilms due to the relative ease of growing consistent and reproducible structured biofilms under laboratory conditions, as well as its relevance as an opportunistic pathogen in hospital settings (Rybtke, Hultqvist, Givskov, & Tolker\u2010Nielsen, 2015). Pseudomonas\u00a0aeruginosa biofilm formation could be largely influenced by quorum sensing (QS) system, which is a mechanism that bacteria use to coordinate their behavior. The las and rhl QS system is mediated by acyl\u2010homoserine lactone (HSL) signals including C4\u2010HSL and 3\u2010oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL, which could activate the transcriptional regulators LasR and RhlR, respectively. The genes regulated by LasR and RhlR could control the biofilm formation, motility phenotype, and other virulence genes. Besides, recently studies have found that the compound 2\u2010heptyl\u20103\u2010hydroxy\u20104\u2010quinolone (Pseudomonas quinolone signal [PQS]) is a third QS signal. PQS was found to regulate the biofilm formation and the antioxidative properties of P.\u00a0aeruginosa by serving as a link between the las and rhl QS system. Besides, QS also plays a pivotal role in antibiotic resistance and virulence (Balasubramanian et\u00a0al., 2011; Lidor, AI\u2010Quntar, Pesci, & Steinberg, 2015).\nConventional antimicrobials have limited effectiveness against biofilm\u2010related infections, which increase the emergence of multidrug\u2010resistant P.\u00a0aeruginosa (Walters, Roe, Bugnicourt, Franklin, & Stewart, 2003). Thus, the discovery of new anti\u2010infective agents, actively against microorganisms embedded in biofilms is an important goal in the treatment of biofilm\u2010related infection (Projan & Youngman, 2002). Interestingly, several studies have shown that certain nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory durgs (NASIDs) possess antimicrobial activity. Chen and Wen (2011) found that treatments including administration of antibiotics together with NASIDs are active against bacteria in the biofilm. It was demonstrated that NASIDs, such as acetylsalicylic acid or diclofenac, characterize with bactericidal reaction on bacteria in the planktonic cells as well as biofilm (Dutta et\u00a0al., 2008; Reslinski, Dabrowiecki, & Glowacka, 2015; Wang et\u00a0al., 2003).\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is only one publication claimed that meloxicam (Melo) can interact with active sites of PQS system by a molecular docking assay (Soheili, Bazzaz, Abdollahpour, & Hadizadeh, 2015), but no other experimental data was found to prove the antibiofilm effect of Melo on P.\u00a0aeruginosa. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Melo against P.\u00a0aeruginosa biofilm formation and its mechanism in vitro. Further, we investigated the synergistic antibiofilm effect of Melo combined with conventional antibiotics (tetracycline, TE; gentamycin, GEN; tobramycin, TOB; ciprofloxacin, CIP; ceftriaxone, CTRX; ofloxacin, OFLX; norfloxacin, NFLX; and ceftazidime, CAZ) and DNase on biofilm formation.\n\n## Bacterial strain and growth condition\nPAO1 was used in the biofilm formation assay and was cultured in Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium (Luqiao, Beijing, China). Melo was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China), and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); In order to eliminate the effect of organic solvent on the results of our study, LB containing 1% DMSO was set as a negative control (NC); TE, TOB, CTRX, OFLX, NFLX, CAZ, and DNase were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China), and dissolved in distilled water.\n\n## Effects of Melo on biofilm formation\nThe inhibitory effects of Melo on biofilm formation of P.\u00a0 aeruginosa were evaluated by a semiquantitative plate assay as described earlier, with minor modifications (Liu et\u00a0al., 2015; Nesse, Berg, & Vestby, 2015). Briefly, 4\u00a0\u03bcl overnight culture was added to 196\u00a0\u03bcl LB with the Melo at the designed concentration to be tested, and LB containing 1% DMSO was set as NC. After static incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0hr, the plates were washed gently three times with saline to remove unattached bacteria, and stained with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet (CV) for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. Then, the plates were washed again to remove the unbonded CV, 200\u00a0\u03bcl 95% ethanol was added to dissolve the CV, and the A570\u00a0nm of the wells was determined using a 96\u2010well plate spectrophotometer (Bio\u2010Tek, USA).\n\n## Evaluation of growth curve\nThe planktonic cell growth assay was modified from (Huang et\u00a0al. (2014) as described previously. Overnight\u2010grown P.\u00a0aeruginosa cells (adjusted to 0.5\u00a0McF) were diluted 1:100 in LB with Melo at the designed concentration to be tested. Triplicate samples were grown in sterile 50\u00a0ml centrifugal tubes (Corning/Costar, USA) at 37\u00b0C with agitation (160\u00a0rpm), and 200\u00a0\u03bcl culture medium was carefully transferred to a microplate every 4\u00a0hr for 20\u00a0hr in total. The planktonic culture turbidity was read at 630\u00a0nm (A630\u00a0nm) by the spectrophotometer.\n\n## Visualization of 24\u00a0hr biofilms\nFor visualization of biofilms, the procedure is briefly described as follows: Overnight\u2010grown P.\u00a0aeruginosa cells were diluted 1:100 in Melo at the designed concentration to be tested in six\u2010well cell culture plates (Corning/Costar, USA) with cover slides, these plates were then statically incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0hr to form biofilms. After incubation, the culture medium was removed and the cover slides were washed with saline for three times, then the cover slides were stained with CV as described above. The biofilm was visualized and photographed with an optical microscope (Olympus CX31, Tokyo, Japan) at the magnification of 400\u00a0\u00d7.\n\n## Motility assays\nSwimming, swarming, and twitching motility were assessed as previously described (Rashid & Kornberg, 2000). To investigate swarming motility, nutrient broth with 0.5% (wt/vol) Difco Bacto agar and different concentrations of Melo was used. A quantity of 4\u00a0\u03bcl of overnight cultures of P.\u00a0aeruginosa grown in LB (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0cells) was placed in the center of agar. After incubation for 24\u00a0hr at 37\u00b0C, the swarming zone diameter was measured. Swimming motility was evaluated using tryptone broth contained 0.3% (wt/vol) agarose. Swim plates were inoculated with P.\u00a0aeruginosa grown overnight in LB agar (1.5%, wt/vol) at 37\u00b0C with a sterile toothpick. After incubation for 14\u00a0hr at 30\u00b0C, the swimming zone diameter was measured. For twitching motility, LB broth containing 1.5% agar was inoculated with a toothpick by stabbing the plates. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0hr, the LB agar media was removed from the plates and then stained with 0.5% CV for 20\u00a0min. Spreading of P.\u00a0aeruginosa from the inoculation point and the length of the \u201cdendrite\u201d were observed by naked eye and microscope (400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0), respectively.\n\n## Colony morphology assay\nA colony morphology assay was performed as the method described earlier, with minor modifications (Kim & Park, 2013). Briefly, 5\u00a0\u03bcl overnight culture of PAO1 in LB broth with (15.63 or 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) Melo or with 1% DMSO was added onto Congo red plates (1.5% agar, 10\u00a0g/L tryptone, 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Coomassie brilliant blue, and 40\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Congo red) and incubated at 25\u00b0C statically for 4\u00a0days.\n\n## Evaluation eDNA\nThe semiquantification of eDNA in the PAO1 biofilm was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Gnanadhas, Elango, Datey, & Chakravortty, 2015). Briefly, treated or untreated 24\u2010hr\u2010old PAO1 biofilm was scraped from the six\u2010well cell culture plates, and sonicated for 15\u00a0min to release the eDNA combined to PAO1 biofilm. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 2,000g for 5\u00a0min and the supernatant was loaded in the agarose gel (1%) and visualized, and grayscale value was calculated by ImageJ.\n\n## Detection of QS\u2010related virulence factors\nExperiment was conducted based on our previous study (Qu et\u00a0al., 2016). Briefly, overnight culture of PAO1 was inoculated into LB broth with (15.63\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and without Melo and incubated for 16\u00a0hr, and then centrifuged at 4,000g for 15\u00a0min and the supernatant was filter sterilized (0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter). Chloroform (in the ratio of 2:3) was used to extract pyocyanin pigment, and the pyocyanin pigment was\u00a0reextracted with 1.0\u00a0ml of 0.2\u00a0mol/L HCl and absorbance was read at 540\u00a0nm (A540\u00a0nm). For elastase activity determination, 750\u00a0\u03bcl supernatant was incubated with 250\u00a0\u03bcl elastin Congo red solution (5\u00a0mg/mL, pH\u00a0=\u00a08.0) for 16\u00a0hr. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min to remove unreacted precipitate, and debris and the absorbance was read at 490\u00a0nm (A490\u00a0nm). For protease activity detection, culture supernatant and 2% azocasein solution (pH\u00a0=\u00a07.0) were incubated in the ratio of 1:1 for 1\u00a0hr. A quantity of 500\u00a0\u03bcl 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 8,000g for 5\u00a0min and the absorbance of supernatant was read at 405\u00a0nm (A405\u00a0nm) (Kim & Park, 2013).\n\n## RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and comparative qPCR\nThe gene expression analysis was performed according to our previous study (Qu et\u00a0al., 2016). Briefly, overnight cultures were grown to an A630\u00a0nm of 0.5\u20130.8 (37\u00b0C, 150\u00a0rpm) in LB broth with (15.63\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) or without (but 2% DMSO was added) Melo. And the total RNA was extracted using a E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit II (Omega Bio\u2010tek, Norcross, GA). RNA purity and concentration were determined by the absorbance at 260 and 280\u00a0nm, and 1\u00a0\u03bcl RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by the TransScript All\u2010in\u2010One First\u2010Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix for qPCR (Transgene, Beijing, China). A qPCR was performed with TransStartTM Green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Transgene, Beijing, China) using a real\u2010time quantitative PCR system (Eppendorf, Germany). The oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the QS\u2010related genes (lasR, rhlR, mvfR, and pqsC/D) and EPS\u2010related genes (pslA, pelA, and alg44) were referred to Qu et\u00a0al. (2016) and Kim, Park, and Lee (2015), respectively.\n\n## Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)\nThe MIC was determined by the broth microdilution method as previously described by The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2006). Concentrations for PAO1 ranged from 1,000 to 0.012\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for antimicrobial standards. Twofold dilutions were obtained in 96\u2010well plates with 100\u00a0\u03bcl of Mueller Hinton II (MH) broth per well. Then, the bacterial suspension (10\u00a0\u03bcl) was inoculated, and the plates were incubated for 16~20\u00a0hr at 35\u00b0C. The lowest concentration with any visible bacterial growth was taken as the MIC.\n\n## Synergistic biofilm inhibitory assay\nInterference of biofilm formation upon treatment with Melo alone or in combination with antimicrobials was performed as the method described earlier, with minor modifications (Das et\u00a0al., 2016). Briefly, 4\u00a0\u03bcl overnight\u2010grown P.\u00a0aeruginosa cells was directly added to 196\u00a0\u03bcl LB containing subminimum inhibitory concentration (sub\u2010MIC) dose of TE (3.125\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), TOB (0.024\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), CTRX (3.125\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), OFLX (3.125\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), CAZ (0.781\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), NFLX (0.781\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), and DNase (6.250\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) alone and in combination with Melo (15.63 or 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0hr. All test plates were washed, stained with CV as described above, and then the absorbance at 570\u00a0nm was measured.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nDifferences between groups were tested using a two\u2010tailed, unpaired Student's t test or one\u2010way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism 6.0 software. Differences were considered statistically significant when p\u00a0<\u00a0.05. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times.\n\n## Antibiofilm activity of Melo\nCV staining assays revealed that Melo could significantly inhibited PAO1 biofilm formation at the concentration of 7.81\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) (Figure\u00a01a) in a dose\u2010dependent manner but Melo did not affect planktonic cell growth at the concentration of \u226431.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (Figure\u00a01b). To exclude diminutions of biofilm formation due to inhibitory effects on bacterial growth, sub\u2010MIC (\u226431.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) of Melo was selected for the rest of the experiment. Microscopic images of biofilm formed by PAO1 in the presence of different concentrations of Melo (0~31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and stained with CV showed that the biofilm formation was inhibited in a dose\u2010dependent manner and the bacterial cells scattered singly on the adherent surface (Figure\u00a02). Both the semiquantitative assays and microscopic images demonstrated that Melo could prevent P.\u00a0aeruginosa biofilm formation.\n\n## Melo inhibits PAO1 motilities\nPAO1 displays several forms of motility on wet agarose including swimming, swarming, and twitching motility. The motilities of PAO1 cells grown with (31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and without Melo were evaluated by growing cells on several motility plates and by measuring the length of diameters (Figure\u00a03a\u2013c). Swimming motility zone of PAO1 without supplementation of Melo was 35.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.30\u00a0mm that was significantly reduced to 17.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.10 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) mm in the presence of 31.25 \u03bcg/ml Melo (Figure\u00a03a and b); Similarly, the swarming zone was reduced from 12.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.31\u00a0mm to 6.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71\u00a0mm (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in the presence of 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Melo (Figure\u00a03a and c). Although, there was not a slight reduction of twitching zones observed by CV staining from naked eye (data not shown), but the length of the dendrites formed by PAO1 on twitching plates was significantly decreased in the presence of 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Melo observed by a microscope (Figure\u00a03d).\n\n## Effect of Melo on extracellular matrix of PAO1 biofilm\nColony morphology was observed on an agar plate containing Congo red (Figure\u00a04a). The colony grown on the plate without meloxicam showed a rugose morphology with reduction of pigment around the periphery known to be related to EPS overproduction. However, the colony became moist and smoother in the presence of 15.62 and 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Melo. At the same time, qPCR analysis for EPS\u2010related genes showed that Melo (15.62\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) could significantly inhibit the genes expression of pslA (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), pelA (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), and alg44 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) (Figure\u00a04b). Besides, earlier reports have shown that P.\u00a0aeruginosa biofilm has eDNA as one of the major component (Flemming & Wingender, 2010). In our study, 24\u2010hr\u2010old biofilm culture supernatant was loaded in a 1% agarose gel and it was visible that Melo treated (15.62 and 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) biofilm culture supernatant possessed less eDNA than untreated group in a dose\u2010dependent manner(Figure\u00a04c). The gray scale analysis of the bands by ImageJ was consistent\u00a0with the electrophoresis results(Figure\u00a04d). These results suggest the inhibition of EPS and eDNA production may play an important role in the antibiofilm effect of Melo on PAO1 under the assay conditions used in this study.\n\n## Effect of Melo on the production of virulence factors and QS\u2010related genes in PAO1\nPyocyanin production of PAO1 was significantly inhibited by 15.63\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Melo compared to the group of negative control (Figure\u00a05a right). After extraction by chloroform and acidification with HCl, the pigment of pyocyanin was turned to red from green (Figure\u00a05a middle), then the absorbance was read at the wavelength of 540\u00a0nm (A540\u00a0nm), which indicated by 32% (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) reduction in pyocyanin production (Fig.\u00a05a left). Significant reduction (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in elastase (23%) (Figure\u00a05b) and alkaline protease (16%) (Figure\u00a05c) production in the presence of 15.63\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of Melo was observed. And qPCR showed that nearly 59%, 51%, 88%, 63%, and 95% reduction in the expression of lasR, rhlR, mvfR, pqsC, and pqsD, when compared to the control group, respectively, with 15.63\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of Melo (Figure\u00a05e).\n\n## Susceptibility pattern of antimicrobials\nTE, TOB, CTRX, OFLX, NFLX, CAZ, and DNase were selected to study the synergistic effects of Melo against biofilm formation of P.\u00a0aeruginosa. MICs of 125\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for TE, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for TOB, 8\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for CTRX, 8\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for OFLX, 4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for NFLX, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for CAZ, and >1,000\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for DNase were observed against P.\u00a0aeruginosa standard strain PAO1.\n\n## Synergistic antibiofilm activity of Melo in combination with antibiotics\nAt sub\u2010MIC levels (3.125\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for TE, 0.024\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for TOB, 3.125 \u03bcg/ml for CTRX and OFLX, 0.781\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for NFLX and CAZ, and 6.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for DNase), TOB (Figure\u00a06b), CTRX (Figure\u00a06c), NFLX (Figure\u00a06f) and CAZ (Figure\u00a06e) alone resulted in moderate reduction in biofilm formation for 24\u00a0hr incubation. However, TE (Figure\u00a06a), OFLX (Figure\u00a06d) and DNase (Figure\u00a06g) did not affect the biofilm formation by PAO1 at the sub\u2010MIC levels. When these sub\u2010MIC antimicrobials were used in combination with Melo (15.63 or 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), a significant reduction of biofilm biomass (CV at A570\u00a0nm) was observed at 24\u00a0hr in comparison with the agents used alone, showing a synergistic effect (Figure\u00a06).\n\n## DISCUSSION\nTreatment of biofilm\u2010associated infections has become a challenge for clinicians owing to persistence of biofilms and rising multidrug resistance, antibiotics could be less active against bacteria embedded into a biofilm by which the antimicrobial activity of Melo should be studied not only against planktonic but also against biofilm\u2010associated organisms (del Prado et\u00a0al., 2010).\nIn this work, we demonstrated that Melo could inhibit the biofilm formation of P.\u00a0aeruginosa PAO1 and some of the clinical isolates at the concentration without limiting bacterial growth, probably by: (1) inhibiting of swimming, swarming, and twitching motility; (2) reducing the production of EPS and eDNA; (3) reducing the expression of QS\u2010related virulence factors and genes. Furthermore, we found that synergistic antimicrobial efficacy could be achieved when treating P.\u00a0aeruginosa with Melo combined with antimicrobials. To our best knowledge, the antimicrobial effect of Melo and its potential synergistic effect when combined with antibiotics have not been explored. Therefore, this is the first work that highlights these effects.\nExtracellular substances of biofilm are a complex mixture of biopolymers mainly including EPS, eDNA, and extracellular proteins. The major functions of these components comprise the primary adherence of bacterial cells to biotic or abiotic surface and protection against dehydration as well as environmental stress (Vu, Chen, Crawford, & Ivanova, 2009). Pel, Psl, and alginate are three vital biofilm EPS in P.\u00a0aeruginosa (Sarabhai, Sharma, & Capalash, 2013; Vu et\u00a0al., 2009). Pel is essential for the formation of pellicles at the air\u2013liquid interface, while Psl is required for the initiate biofilm formation and biofilm structure maintenance (Vu et\u00a0al., 2009). Alginate is regulated by gene operon of alg44, and is associated with chronic stages of biofilm\u2010mediated infection (Schurr, 2013). On the other hand, eDNA can be up to 50% more abundant than cellular DNA in biofilms of P.\u00a0aeruginosa (Steinberger & Holden, 2005), in which it functions as an intercellular connector (Flemming & Wingender, 2010). eDNA plays a central role in biofilm formation by increasing cellular aggregation and surface adhesion, leading to increased biofilm strength and integrity (Das et\u00a0al., 2015). Our result about the production of eDNA and expression of EPS\u2010related genes implies that the Melo treatment may inhibit biofilm formation by decreasing the eDNA, Psl, Pel, and alginate production.\nThere were several evidences that NASIDs have antipseudomonal effect (Alem & Douglas, 2004; Bandara, Sankaridurg, & Willcox, 2004; Kopolovic, Thraikill, Martin, Carey, & Cloutier, 1986; Naeem, Chadhury, Amjad, Rehaman, & Khan, 2012; Nicolau, Marangos, Nightingale, & Quintiliani, 1995; Stepanovic, Vukovic, Jesic, & Ranin, 2004; Umaru, Nwamba, & Kolo, 2009). For example, aspirin was reported to have a weak and broad\u2010spectrum antimicrobial activity towards some planktonic and biofilm cultures (Alem & Douglas, 2004; Nicolau et\u00a0al., 1995; Stepanovic et\u00a0al., 2004); diclofenac and ibuprofen could also limit the formation of biofilm by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in the concentration obtained in the serum (Reslinski et\u00a0al., 2015).\nHowever, the mechanism of NASIDs impact on bacterial biofilm formation has not been fully explained. It is considered that this kind of effect should be due to inhibition of bacterial initial attachment (Demirag, Esen, Zivalioglu, Leblebicioglu, & Keceligil, 2007; Muller, Al\u2010Attar, Wolff, & Farber, 1998), reduction of EPS and protein syntheses (Farber & Wolff, 1992; Muller et\u00a0al., 1998), and change of hydrophobicity (Naves et\u00a0al., 2010). Another possible interpretation for biofilm inhibition is their impact on the QS system (Ulusoy & Bosgelmez\u2010Tinaz, 2013). QS system is a bacterial communication process that depends on the bacterial population density. Pseudomonas aeruginosa employs three QS signaling systems (LasR/LasI, RhlR/RhlI, and PQS) (Sauer, Camper, Ehrlich, Costerton, & Davies, 2002). The QS system of P.\u00a0aeruginosa mainly possess two types of N\u2010acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signaling system, the lasR/I system using 3\u2010oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL and the rhlR/I system using C4\u2010HSL. Accumulation of those signaling molecules could trigger the corresponding receptors, and the AHL\u2010LasR/RhlR protein complexes not only positively regulate the AHL synthesis for itself, but they also act as activators for the promoter sites of the QS\u2010related operons (Naves et\u00a0al., 2010) which control diverse array of functions like virulence, antibiotic resistance, swarming and motility, oxidative stress tolerance, and biofilm formation (Bhardwaj, Vinothkumar, & Rajpara, 2013). Recently, another type of QS system was revealed, namely PQS system. The synthesis of PQS depends on the pqsABCDE operon, which is positively controlled by the transcriptional regulator MvfR (Cao et\u00a0al., 2001; Gallagher, McKnight, Kuznetsova, Pesci, & Manoil, 2002). Such QS system could regulate biofilm development, swarming motility, virulence, and pathogenicity mediated by the signal molecules of 2\u2010alkyl\u20104(1H)\u2010quinolones (AQs) (Rampioni et\u00a0al., 2010; Schertzer, Brown, & Whiteley, 2010).\nSoheili et\u00a0al. (2015) revealed that oxicams, both of piroxicam and Melo, could interact well with active sites of LasR and PqsE with the Ki of 119.43\u00a0nmol/L and 4.0\u00a0\u03bcmol/L by molecular docking and structural analysis methodology. LasR plays an important role in the initiation of the P.\u00a0aeruginosa QS cascade system and PqsE can enhance this system. However, there is no in vitro or in vivo experimental evidence to support such speculation. Similarly, our study found that Melo showed significant inhibitory effect on P.\u00a0aeruginosa biofilm formation in vitro, and Melo could significantly inhibit motilities, QS\u2010related virulence factors and genes expression. However, there was almost no effect of piroxicam on P.\u00a0aeruginosa biofilm formation (data not shown).\nWith the increasing resistance of bacteria to traditional antibiotics, there is an urgent need for the alternatives to replace antibiotics for combating bacterial infections or adjunct therapies to be used in combination with antibiotics so that lower doses of the conventional antibiotics are required for treatment (Bhardwaj et\u00a0al., 2013). These findings suggest that Melo could significantly inhibit the biofilm formation of P.\u00a0aeruginosa, and the combination treatment of Melo with antimicrobials is a promising strategy to prevent biofilm infections. Despite the successful demonstration of synergy in vitro, it does not necessarily mean an improved clinical outcome, due to the complexity of the in vivo environment during infection. These results may open the door for the development of treatments to diminish biofilm\u2010related infection caused by P.\u00a0aeruginosa.\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST\nNone declared.",
