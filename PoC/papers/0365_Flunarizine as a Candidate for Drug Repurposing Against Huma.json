  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nLassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever (LF), is endemic to large regions of West Africa, where it is estimated to infect several hundred thousand people, resulting in many cases of LF, a febrile disease associated with high morbidity and case-fatality rates (CFRs) of 15\u201320% among hospitalized LF patients [1,2,3,4,5]. Since 2018, there has been an unprecedented rise in the incidence of Lassa fever (LF) cases in West African countries, including Nigeria. The CFR in confirmed cases of LF in Nigeria by November 2019 had reached 21%. LF has been listed as one of the priority diseases for research and countermeasures development by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018 [6,7,8]. LF is a hemorrhagic fever disease with epidemic potential and for which no licensed vaccines or specific therapies are currently available. The off-label use of the nucleoside analogue ribavirin (RIB) has been reported to provide clinical benefits if treatment is initiated within six days of onset of symptoms. However, the efficacy of RIB remains controversial [9,10] and it can cause significant side effects [11,12]. Hence, the development of therapeutics to treat LF represents an unmet problem of clinical significance.\nLASV is an enveloped virus with a bi-segmented negative-stranded RNA genome [13,14]. Each genome segment uses an ambisense coding strategy to express two viral proteins from open reading frames separated by non-coding intergenic regions (IGRs). The large (L) segment encodes the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, L protein, and the matrix Z protein, whereas the small (S) segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) [13,15,16]. GPC is co-translationally processed by cellular signal peptidase to generate a stable signal peptide (SSP) and a GPC precursor that is post-translationally cleaved by the cellular proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin isozyme-1/site-1 protease (SKI-1/S1P) to generate GP1 and GP2 subunits. The GP1 and GP2 subunits, together with the SSP, form mature glycoprotein (GP) peplomers on the surface of the virion envelope that mediate virion cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis. LASV GP1 interacts with \u03b1-dystroglycan [17,18] and the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) [19] to facilitate virus cell entry. GP2 is responsible for mediating the pH-dependent fusion of the virus and the host cell membranes to complete the entry process [20,21]. NP is the most abundant viral protein in virions and infected cells. As with other mammarenaviruses, LASV NP encapsidates the viral genome to generate the nucleocapsid (NC) template that\u2014in association with the virus RdRp L protein\u2014forms the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) responsible for directing the biosynthetic processes of replication and transcription of the viral genome [13]. The C-terminal region of NP contains a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease domain (ExoN) of type DEDDH that has been implicated in NP\u2019s anti-interferon activity and viral fitness [22], as well as evading PKR kinase activity [23]. The LASV matrix Z protein, a myristoylated protein, plays critical roles in the assembly and cell egress via budding of viral particles [24,25], a process that can be targeted using N-myristoyl transferase inhibitors [26].\nSeveral experimental drugs targeting different steps of the LASV life cycle are currently being investigated, or repurposed, as candidate therapeutics to treat mammarenavirus, including LASV infections [27], and the LASV GP-mediated fusion inhibitor LHF-535 is in phase I clinical trials [28]. However, the uncertainty about their in vivo efficacy underscores the need for research aimed at expanding the number and diversity of candidate drugs to treat infections by human pathogenic mammarenaviruses, including LASV. In the present work, using in silico docking simulation methods, we identified five existing drugs (dexamethasone, ergocalciferol, flunarizine, mefloquine, and tadalafil) with predicted high binding affinities to the endonuclease (EndoN) domain located at the N-terminal region of LASV L, the ExoN domain of NP and the Z protein. We tested their antiviral activity using LASV and LCMV cell-based minigenome systems and LCMV cell-based infection assays. We found that flunarizine (FLN) inhibited the activity of LASV and LCMV MG, a surrogate of vRNP activity, and significantly reduced (\u22651 log) peak titers of LCMV in a multi-step growth kinetics assay in human A549 cells. In addition to its effect on vRNP activity and unanticipated based on the in silico docking results, FLN inhibited GP2-mediated fusion required for completion of virus cell entry. Our findings are consistent with the activity of FLN as a selective calcium-entry blocker antagonist [29,30], as Ca2+ flow and signaling have been shown to contribute to different steps of multiplication of different viruses [31,32,33,34]. However, other selected calcium channel blockers, including the combined L-/T-type (verapamil and nickel chloride) [35,36,37,38] and L-type (nifedipine and gabapentin) [39,40,41,42] calcium channel blockers, did not exhibit significant anti-LCMV activity, suggesting that FLN anti-mammarenaviral activity may not be related to its ability to block T-type calcium channels. FLN binds calmodulin, which can interfere with the role of calmodulin in low-pH-induced intracellular membrane fusion [43], thus interfering with GP2-mediated, pH-induced fusion required for mammarenavirus cell entry.\nFLN is a selective calcium-entry blocker antagonist that is being used in many countries worldwide to treat vertigo and migraine, supporting the interest in exploring its repurposing as a candidate drug to treat LASV infections.\n\n## 2.1. In Silico Screening\nThe 3D structures of LASV L polymerase (PDB, 5J1N), NP (PDB, 3q7c), GP1 (PDB, 4ZJF), GP2 (PDB, 5OMI), and Z matrix protein (PDB, 2M1S) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), examined with PyMol-1.4.1, and appropriately prepared for molecular docking simulations using Chimera-1.9 [44] and MGLTools-1.5.6 [45]. A total of 2015 existing drugs were obtained from DrugBank and prepared for molecular docking simulations using MGLTools-1.5.6 [45]. Briefly, all hydrogen and Gasteiger charges were added, roots were detected, and torsions and all rotatable bonds were allowed in their natural states. Then, outputs were generated as a PDBQT file extension and used for the virtual screening after validation of docking protocols.\nBefore molecular docking simulations, the reference compounds and their respective targets were subjected to blind docking and re-docking. Briefly, the reference compounds and all hetero-molecules in the drug target were deleted using Chimera-1.9 [44]. Polar hydrogen, Kollman charges, grid box sizes and centers (Table 1) at grid spacing of 1.0 \u00c5 were determined with MGLTools-1.5.6 [45]. The reference compound was subjected to 1000 steps of steepest descent and 100 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization at a step size of 0.02 using Chimera-1.9. Then, it was prepared for molecular docking simulations using MGLTools-1.5.6 [45]. All hydrogen and Gasteiger charges were added to the reference compounds and roots were detected. Then, torsions and all rotatable bonds were allowed in their natural states. Output was then generated as a PDBQT file extension. The targets and their respective reference compounds and the prepared existing drugs were used for the docking simulations/virtual screening. The docking simulations/virtual screening were performed with AutoDock Vina [46] using the parameters presented in Table 1.\nThe compound library set was batched for molecular docking simulations against the three LASV protein targets using virtual screening scripts. Molecular docking simulations were implemented, with four replicates, on a Linux platform using AutoDock Vina [46] and associated tools after validation of docking protocols. For The L protein, docking was performed using the endonuclease (EndoN) domain of LASV L (PDB ID: 5J1N). Blind docking was initially performed to identify the favorable binding site/pocket for the reference compound (efavirenz). Thereafter, refined docking simulation was performed using the docking parameters in Table 1. The NP docking was performed using the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease (ExoN) domain of LASV NP (PDB ID: 3Q7C). Blind docking was initially performed to identify the favorable binding site/pocket for the reference compound (Fmoc_D_Cha_OH). Thereafter, refined docking simulation was performed using the docking parameters in Table 1. Initial inspection of the Z protein (PDB ID: 2M1S) showed it had some binding pockets. Blind docking was initially performed to identify the favorable binding site/pocket for the reference compound (acyclovir). Thereafter, refined docking simulation was performed using the docking parameters in Table 1. Binding free energy values (kcal/mol \u00b1 SD) were ranked to identify the front-runner compounds. The inhibition constant (Ki) was obtained from the binding energy (\u0394G) using the formula Ki = exp(\u0394G/RT), where R is the universal gas constant (1.985 \u00d7 10\u22123 kcal mol\u22121 K\u22121) and T is the temperature (298.15 K). Existing drugs with strong L, NP, and Z binding affinities were selected as potential candidate therapeutics for the treatment of LF. Molecular descriptors of selected compounds were extracted from relevant databases.\nTo select existing drugs for possible treatment of mild infections of Lassa fever (early presenters), we first sorted existing drugs with very strong polymerase binding affinities (with efavirenz as cutoff compound), then sorted the resulting list for good myristoylation binding affinities (with acyclovir as cutoff compound) before finally sorting the list for good nuclease binding affinities (with FMOC_D_Cha_OH as cutoff compound). Similarly, existing drugs with very strong nuclease binding affinities (with FMOC_D_Cha_OH as cutoff compound) were first sorted from the list. The resulting list was subsequently sorted for good myristoylation binding affinities (with lassamycin as cutoff compound), and finally the remaining existing drugs were sorted for good polymerase binding affinities (without any cutoff compound) to generate the list of drugs for possible treatment of severe infections of Lassa fever (late presenters). The LF virus protein residues responsible for interactions with some existing front-runner drugs were also explored in the respective receptor\u2013ligand complexes using Discovery Studio 2024.\n\n## 2.2. Source of Compounds\nFlunarizine (FLN) dihydrochloride (HY-B0358A, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), mefloquine (MEF) hydrochloride (HY-17437A MedChemExpress, NJ, USA), ergocalciferol (vitamin D) (HY-76542 MedChemExpress, NJ, USA), tadalafil (TAD) (HY-90009A MedChemExpress, NJ, USA), dexamethasone (DEX) (D2915 Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n## 2.3. Cells and Viruses\nHEK 293T (ATCC CRL-3216), Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586), and A549 (ATCC CCL-185) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vacaville, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL of penicillin. Recombinant viruses rLCMV/GFP-P2A-NP [47], r3JUNVCandid GFP/GFP [48], rARM\u0394GPC/ZsG-P2A-NP [23,49] have been described.\n\n## 2.4. Virus Titration\nVirus titers were determined by focus-forming assay (FFA) [50] using Vero E6 cells. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (2 \u00d7 104 cells/well) and the next day infected with 10-fold serial virus dilutions. At 20 h post infection (hpi), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and infected cells were identified by epifluorescence based on their GFP expression.\n\n## 2.5. Cell-Based Minigenome (MG) Assays\nThe LASV and LCMV MG systems have been described [51,52], and these were used to assess the anti-vRNP activity of hits identified by in silico docking.\n\n## 2.5.1. LASV MG Assay\nHEK293T cells were seeded at 3.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well onto a poly-L-lysine treated 12-well plate 20 h prior transfection with pCAGGS-T7 Cyt (0.5 \u03bcg), pT7MG-ZsGreen (0.5 \u03bcg), pCAGGS-NP (0.3 \u03bcg), and pCAGGS-L (0.6 \u03bcg) plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (2.5 \u03bcL/\u03bcg of DNA). After 5 h, the transfection medium was exchanged with fresh medium containing 20 \u00b5M of test compounds. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection and ZsGreen expression levels were measured. Briefly, whole-cell lysates were prepared using 0.2 mL of buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, and 150 mM NaCl). ZsGreen expression levels in clarified lysates were quantified using a Synergy H4 Hybrid MultiMode microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). The measurements were normalized to total cell protein content, determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mean values were then normalized to the vehicle (DMSO)-treated control, which was set to 100%. LASV L and NP sequences used in the MG assay were those from the Josiah strain.\n\n## 2.5.2. LCMV MG Assay\nHEK293T cells were plated at a density of 3.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well onto a poly-L-lysine-treated 12-well plate 20 h prior to transfection with pCAGGS-T7 Cyt (0.5 \u03bcg), pT7MG-GFP (0.5 \u03bcg), pCAGGS-NP (0.3 \u03bcg), and pCAGGS-L (0.6 \u03bcg) plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (2.5 \u03bcL/\u03bcg of DNA). After 5 h, the transfection medium was exchanged with fresh medium containing 20 \u00b5M of test compounds. At 48 h post-transfection, whole-cell lysates were prepared using 0.2 mL of buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, and 150 mM NaCl) and GFP expression levels in clarified lysates quantified using the Synergy H4 Hybrid MultiMode microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA). The measurements were normalized to total cell protein content, determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). The mean values were then normalized to the vehicle (DMSO)-treated control, which was set to 100%.\n\n## 2.6. Cell Viability Assay\nCellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution reagent (Promega, CAT#: G3580, Madison, WI, USA) was utilized to evaluate cell viability. This assay quantifies the number of living cells by measuring the amount of formazan produced from MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolim] through the action of NADPH or NADH generated in viable cells. Cells were plated on a 96-well optical plate at 3.0 \u00d7 104 cells/well. After 20 h of incubation, compounds (at indicated concentrations in four replicates) or vehicle control were added to the cells in a final volume of 100 \u00b5L. At 48 h post-treatment, CellTiter 96 AQueous One solution reagent (Promega) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C/5% CO2. Absorbance measurements were taken at 490 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (SPECTRA max plus 384, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The results were normalized to the vehicle control group (DMSO), which was assigned a value of 100%.\n\n## 2.7. Determination of Compounds EC\nCells were seeded onto a 96-well optical plate at 3.0 \u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were infected with rLCMV/GFP-P2A-NP at an MOI of 0.03 and treated with 3-fold serial dilutions of the indicated compound starting at 100 \u00b5M (four replicates for each compound and dilution concentration) for 48 h prior to CC50 and EC50 determination. CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution was used to determine the CC50 with values normalized to vehicle-treated control (0.2% DMSO) that was adjusted to 100%. To determine EC50 values, the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution and media were aspirated and the cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. GFP expression levels were determined by fluorescence using a Biotek Cytation 5 plate reader (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Mean values were normalized to infected and vehicle (DMSO)-treated control that was adjusted to 100%. EC50 and CC50 values were determined using GraphPad Prism v10 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\n## 2.8. Virus Multi-Step Growth Kinetics\nA549 cells were seeded at 2.0 \u00d7 105 cells per well in a 12-well plate and the next day infected with rLCMV/GFP-P2A-NP an MOI of 0.03. After 90 min adsorption, the inoculum was removed and cells treated with VC (0.5% DMSO) or FLN (50 \u00b5M) or RIB (100 \u00b5M) as a positive control. Tissue culture supernatants (TCS) were collected at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. At the experimental end point (72 hpi) cells were stained with Hoechst dye solution. Live cell images were captured using a Keyence BZ-X710 all-in-one fluorescence microscope series. Cells were washed and RNA isolated using TRI Reagent (TR 118, Molecular Research Centre, Cincinnati, OH, USA). The titers of the TCS were determined by FFA using Vero E6 cells (four replicates), with values presented as mean \u00b1 SD. Data were plotted using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\n## 2.9. RT-qPCR\nRT-qPCR was performed as described in [23]. RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The isolated RNA was resuspended in RNA storage solution (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA. AM 7000) and quantified using a NanoDrop\u2122 2000 spectrophotometer (ND-2000 Thermo Fisher Scientific\u2122). RNA (1 \u00b5g) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript IV first-strand synthesis system (18091050, Life Technologies). Powerup SYBR (A25742, Life Technologies) was used to amplify LCMV NP, and the housekeeping gene GAPDH using the following primers: NP forward (F): 5\u2032 CAGAAATGTTGATGCTGGACTGC-3\u2032 and NP reverse (R): 5\u2032-CAGACCTTGGCTTGCTTTACACAG-3\u2032; GAPDH F: 5\u2032-CATGAGAAGTATGACAACAGCC-3\u2032 and GAPDH R: 5\u2032-TGAGTCCTTCCACGATACC-3\u2032.\n\n## 2.10. Time of Addition Assay\nA549 cells were seeded at 3 \u00d7 104 cells per 96-well (black-walled optical) plate (353219, Falcon) and grown for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated with VC (0.25% DMSO), FLN (50 \u00b5M), and F3406 (5 \u00b5M) (four replicates for each treatment) starting 2 h prior infection or 2 h post-infection with the single-cycle infectious rARM\u0394GPC/ZsG-P2A-NP (MOI of 1.0), which eliminated the need for NH4Cl treatment to prevent the confounding factor introduced by multiple rounds of infection. At 24 hpi, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and ZsGreen expression levels were measured using a Cytation 5 imaging reader.\n\n## 2.11. Budding Assay\nBudding assays using the Z-Gaussia luciferase-based assay (LASV-Z-GLuc plasmid) [53] were performed. Briefly, 293T cells (1.75 \u00d7 105 cells/well in 12-well plate) were transfected with 0.5 \u03bcg of pC.LASV-Z_Gluc or pC.LASV-Z-G2A-GLuc (mutant control) or pCAGGS-Empty (pC-E) using Lipofectamine 2000. After 5 h transfection, cells were washed three times and treated with FLN (50 \u00b5M), RIB (100 \u00b5M), or vehicle control (VC). After 48 h of treatment, cell culture supernatants (CCSs) containing virus-like particles (VLPs) and cells were collected. CCS samples were clarified from cell debris by centrifugation (13,000 rpm/4 \u00b0C/10 min) and aliquots (20 \u00b5L each) from CCS samples were added to 96-well black plates (VWR, West Chester, PA, USA) and 50 \u00b5L of Steady-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega) added to each well. Cell lysates were prepared using 250 \u00b5L of lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 62.5 mM EDTA, 0.4% sodium deoxycholate). Lysates were clarified from cell debris by centrifugation (13,000 rpm/4 \u00b0C/10 min). GLuc activity in Z-containing VLP and whole-cell lysates (WCLs) was determined using the Steady-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol using a Berthold Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA). The GLuc activity in CCS and WCL served as a surrogate for Z protein levels. Z budding efficiency (in %) was determined by the ratio of VLP-associated GLuc levels (ZVLP) and total GLuc levels (ZVLP + ZWCL) times 100.\n\n## 2.12. GPC-Mediated Cell Fusion Assay\nHEK293T cells were seeded onto poly-L-lysine coated wells in a 24-well plate (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/well). Following an incubation period of 20 h, cells were transfected with plasmids expressing LCMV GPC together with a plasmid expressing GFP or with a plasmid expressing GFP alone using Lipofectamine 3000. At 18 h post-transfection, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS and FLN (50 \u00b5M) or VC. At 5 h post-treatment, 0.5 mL of acidic (pH 5.0) or neutral (pH 7.2) DMEM was added to the cells and incubated for 15 min (37 \u00b0C/5% CO2), washed once with DMEM +10% FBS, and 0.5 mL of DMEM containing 10% FBS and FLN (50 \u00b5M) or VC was added per well. Cells were fixed after 2 h with 4% PFA and stained with DAPI. Syncytium formation was visualized and imaged using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope to record the GFP expression.\n\n## 2.13. Virucidal Assay\nrLCMV/GFP-P2A-NP (105 FFU) was treated with FLN at 1, 50, and 100 \u00b5M or VC for 30 min at room temperature. The infectivity of the virus after treatment was determined by FFA using Vero E6 cells. Infected cells were identified based on their GFP expression and are presented as means \u00b1 SD (four replicates). The counts were normalized (%) to vehicle-treated infected cells, which was set at 100%.\n\n## 2.14. Epifluorescence\nImages were collected using the Keyence BZ-X710 microscope. Images were transferred to a laptop for data processing purposes. Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 was used to assemble and arrange the images, with each one being imported separately and arranged in a cohesive manner within its respective composite. The canvas size was adjusted to ensure a harmonious layout.\n\n## 2.15. Statistical Analysis\nAll statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism software v.10.2.3 (403) (GraphPad).\n\n## 3.1. In Silico Docking Screen to Identify Candidate Drug Inhibitors of LASV Multiplication\nTo identify potential anti-LASV compounds, we conducted an in silico screen of 2015 approved drugs potentially binding to LASV proteins (L, Z, NP, and GPC) (Figure 1). Based on docking parameters, we did not pursue potential GPC interactors (Supplementary Table S1). Our in silico docking screen identified five (5) approved drugs with favorable docking scores (Table 1 and Table 2). The five approved drugs were further subjected to in vitro validations.\n\n## 3.2. Effect of Selected Hits on the Activity of LASV and LCMV vRNPs\nBased on the parameters of the in silico docking screen, we selected MEF, TAD, DEX, Vit D, and FLN as the top candidate hits for testing their ability to inhibit the activity of LASV and the closely related mammarenavirus LCMV vRNPs. For this, we used described LASV and LCMV cell-based minigenome (MG) assays [54]. These MG systems recapitulate the steps involved in LASV and LCMV RNA synthesis using an intracellular reconstituted vRNP that directs expression of a reporter gene (ZsGreen for LASV-MG and GFP for LCMV-MG) whose expression levels serve as an accurate surrogate of the vRNP activity. Intracellular reconstitution of LASV and LCMV vRNP requires co-expression of the corresponding viral L and NP proteins, as well as a plasmid to launch intracellular synthesis of the viral MG vRNA. In these experiments, expression levels of the MG reporter serve as a comprehensive measurement of LASV and LCMV MG replication, transcription, and translation of the MG-encoded reporter gene. We first assessed the effect of each compound on the viability of HEK293T cells and found that none of the five tested compounds had noticeable effects on cell viability when used up to 20 \u00b5M, the concentration we selected for the cell-based MG assay (Figure 2c). We then transfected HEK293T cells with the components of the LASV or LCMV MG system and treated them with the indicated compounds (20 \u00b5M), vehicle control (VC), or RIB (100 \u00b5M), a validated inhibitor of LASV and LCMV replication (Figure 2a). At 48 h post-transfection, whole-cell lysates were prepared and expression levels of ZsGreen (LASV-MG) and GFP (LCMV-MG) determined and normalized to the amount of total protein in the corresponding sample. Mean values (four replicates) of reporter gene expression were normalized by assigning a value of 100% to the vehicle control (VC)-treated sample. In parallel, cells transfected with the same combination of plasmids were fixed with 4% PFA at 48 h post-transfection and representative fields imaged using a Keyence BZ-X710 imaging system (Figure 2b). Compared to VC-treated cells, we observed a significant (~50%) reduction in LASV MG-directed ZsGreen expression levels in cells treated with FLN. We observed a much lower effect on LASV MG activity in cells treated with any of the other selected hits: dexamethasone (~28% reduction), VIT D (~18% reduction), TAD (~12% reduction), and MEF (5% reduction) (Figure 2a). We observed a similar pattern of compound-mediated inhibition of the LCMV MG activity, with FLN exhibiting the strongest inhibitory effect (Figure 2a).\n\n## 3.3. Dose-Dependent Inhibitory Effect of Selected Drugs on LCMV Multiplication in Cultured Cells\nSelected hits from the in silico docking screen exhibited similar activity patterns against LASV and LCMV vRNP, suggesting that these drugs may have a similar inhibitory effect on the multiplication of LASV and LCMV. We therefore used the BSL2 agent LCMV to test the compounds in a cell-based infection assay, avoiding the need for the highest BSL4 containment required for the use of live LASV [55].\nWe determined the dose-dependent effect of MEF, TAD, DEX, Vit D, and FLN on rLCMV/GFP multiplication in A549 cells. For this, we infected A549 cells with rLCMV/GFP (MOI = 0.03) and treated them with threefold serial dilutions of each compound. At 48 h post-infection (hpi) CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent was added to the cells, and after incubation for 35 min (37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2), absorbance values were collected. Cells were then fixed (4% PFA/PBS) and GFP expression levels measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Figure 3). Normalized cell viability values and GFP expression levels were used to determine drug CC50 and EC50 values using GraphPad Prism software v10 (Figure 3). Consistent with the cell-based MG assay results, FLN was the drug with the best antiviral profile in the LCMV cell-based infection assay, with EC50 of 27.91 \u00b5M and a CC50 of above 100 \u00b5M. MEF exhibited moderate anti-LCMV activity in Vero cells (EC50 of 15.51 \u00b5M), but due to toxicity (CC50 of 29.12 \u00b5M) showed a very low selective index (SI) of 1.87. DEX, Vit D and TAD had minimal toxicity on Vero cells and exhibited very poor inhibitory activity on LCMV multiplication.\n\n## 3.4. Characterization of the Effect of FLN on LCMV Multi-Step Growth Kinetics in A549 Cells\nFLN exhibited the highest potency among all five compounds assessed, and we used Discovery Studio to identify the specific amino acid residues in each viral protein predicted to interact with FLN (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). To further investigate the effect of FLN on mammarenavirus multiplication, we first examined the dose-dependent effect of FLN on LCMV multiplication (Figure 4a) in A549 cells.\nA549 cells were seeded (3.0 \u00d7 104 cells/well) in a 96-well plate and 16 h later infected with rLCMV/GFP-P2A-NP at an MOI of 0.03. After 90 min adsorption, the virus inoculum was removed and infected cells treated with the indicated concentrations (different doses) of FLN (four replicates per concentration). At 72 hpi, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with DAPI. GFP expression levels and DAPI staining were used to determine virus infectivity and cell viability, respectively. Values correspond to the means \u00b1 SD of four replicates. Levels of GFP expression and DAPI staining were normalized, assigning a value of 100% to GFP expression levels and DAPI staining of VC-treated and infected cells. Normalized values were used to determine the EC50 and CC50. FLN had an EC50 of 30.11 \u00b5M, CC50 of 74.3 \u00b5Mn, and SI of 2.5. We next examined the effect of FLN on the production of infectious viral progeny (Figure 4b) and virus cell propagation (Figure 4c) in A549 following infection with rLCMV/GFP-P2A-NP at an MOI of 0.03. We used treatment with RIB (100 \u00b5M) as a benchmark for a validated inhibitor of mammarenavirus multiplication. At the indicated hpi, cell culture supernatants (CCSs) were collected, the media replaced with FluoroBrite DMEM, and cells stained with Hoechst. Virus titers in CCS samples were determined using a FFA and Vero E6 as cell substrate (Figure 4b). Representative images of each sample were obtained using live-cell fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4c). After images were collected, total cellular RNA was isolated from each sample and levels of LCMV NP RNA determined by RT-qPCR (Figure 4d) for each treatment and normalized to levels of GAPDH. Relative quantification was performed using untreated samples as reference. Average values \u00b1 SD were plotted (p < 0.05). FLN (50 \u00b5M) caused a 1-log reduction in virus peak titers (Figure 4b) that correlated with reduced virus cell propagation (Figure 4c), as well as levels of viral RNA determined by RT-qPCR (Figure 4d).\n\n## 3.5. Effect of FLN Treatment on Different Steps of LCMV Life Cycle\nTo gain insights about the mechanism whereby FLN exerted its antiviral activity against LCMV, we examined which steps of the virus life cycle were affected in the presence of FLN. To examine whether FLN affected a cell entry or post-entry step of the LCMV life cycle, we conducted a time-of-addition experiment using the single-cycle infectious rLCMV\u2206GPC/ZsG to prevent the confounding factor introduced by multiple rounds of infection (Figure 5a). A549 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (3.0 \u00d7 104 cells/well), and after overnight incubation treated with FLN (50 \u00b5M) or VC, starting 2 h prior (\u22122) or 2 h post (+2) infection (MOI of 1) with rARM\u0394GPC/ZsG-P2A-NP. ZsG expression levels were determined at 48 hpi and mean values normalized to VC-trea",
