  "full_text": "## Introduction\nMultidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are among the most urgent obstacles in the treatment of infectious diseases. Infections caused by extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases-producing Enterobacteriaceae or multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with increased mortality and hospital length of stay1. Only a limited number of new suitable antibacterial agents are in development for targeting these infections2. Among these, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising3. However, the currently known AMPs are of limited therapeutic value due to systemic toxicity and poor stability4. Toxicity has been cited as one reason preventing the clinical use of otherwise promising candidates such as LL-37, a natural AMP generated by proteolysis of human cathelicidin5,6, and it explains why the use of other similar compounds are largely restricted to topical applications4,7.\nThe activity of AMPs is often dramatically impeded following contact with the anionic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria8,9. Intriguingly, several plants and animals overcome this antimicrobial resistance by deploying multiple peptide isoforms. In this way, temporins and dermaseptins, groups of AMPs isolated from amphibians, provide a specific and fast-acting defence system through synergy between these AMP isoforms10\u201314. Antimicrobial formulations based on such multimerics have previously been proposed12,14. However, technical challenges emerge in large-scale, reproducible manufacturing3 as well as in the design of safe formulations. One manufacturing option involves the preparation of antimicrobial polypeptides from random polymerization of N-carboxy-\u03b1-amino anhydride monomers. As early as the late 1950s, it was observed that poly-lysine and random copolymers resembling the natural AMP gramicidin could disrupt bacterial membranes15. More recent polymerization techniques enabled the synthesis of binary-block polymers with a well-defined chain composition and length, which adopt the cationic and amphiphilic nature of many AMPs16. These copolymers possess high antimicrobial activity17. To our knowledge, however, none of the more recently designed antimicrobial copolymers have been tested in humans. Consequently, their toxicity in humans remains unexplored.\nThe random copolymer glatiramer acetate (GA; also referred to as COP-1)18 was among the first effective medical treatments of multiple sclerosis (MS)19. From more than 20 years of use in the clinic, GA treatment is known to be safe and well tolerated, even when administered systemically20\u201323. GA copolymers are made from random copolymerization of the acetic anhydrides of l-glutamate, l-lysine, l-alanine, and l-tyrosine in molar ratios that produce polymers with an overall cationic and amphipathic character24. It was recently demonstrated that the chemical and biophysical properties of GA are similar to LL-3725, including the ability of GA to disrupt lipid bilayers. GA\u2019s composition of random copolymers is reminiscent of temporins and dermaseptins. However, the antimicrobial properties of GA has not been previously addressed.\nHere, we report that GA has substantial antibacterial effects. The activity is effective against Gram-negative organisms including P. aeruginosa, but less effective against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical strains of P. aeruginosa from airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients displayed varying degrees of susceptibility to GA. Guided by recent progress in characterizing the nanostructure of microbial surfaces26 and their interaction with AMPs27, we investigated the microbial responses to AMPs in terms of formation of particulate material. Treatment with both LL-37 and GA enhanced formation of nanoparticulates by S. aureus, whereas Gram-negative species did not form nanoparticulates. Our results suggest that at least some of the challenges in designing safe AMPs using the principles of synergetic AMP isoforms could be overcome by repurposing GA for antimicrobial treatment, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n## The antimicrobial effect of GA on bacterial culture growth\nThe inhibitory of GA on bacterial growth was evaluated by an optical antimicrobial susceptibility testing system (OASTS), which enable real-time cell-by-cell enumeration from time-lapse microscopy. With appropriate adjustments in the initial cell concentration and duration of the experiments to fit the data collection capacity of the instrument, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of GA was determined for laboratory strains of S. aureus (Wood 46) and E. coli (NCTC 10418) with the OASTS (Fig.\u00a01). Representative images are shown of the bacterial density immediately after application of GA (0\u2009h), in the middle of the time lapse (3\u2009h) and at the end of the incubation (5\u2009h) (Fig.\u00a01A). Untreated E. coli and S. aureus showed exponential growth to high density within 2\u20133\u2009h of incubation. With addition of GA to the E. coli culture, growth was retarded after \u223c15\u2009min and with a MIC of 31\u2009\u00b5g/ml. This was different from the lower antimicrobial efficacy against S. aureus with a MIC of 500\u2009\u00b5g/ml (Fig.\u00a01B). The OASTS failed analysis of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) cultures, because the formation of cell aggregates prevented reproducible enumeration by the software (data not shown).Figure 1Bacterial growth of S. aureus and E. coli assessed by OASTS. Bacteria were incubated with GA to establish MIC from two-fold serial dilutions. (A) The oCelloScope\u2122 instrument recorded pictures of the bacterial growth every 10\u201315\u2009min during the experiment. Pictures from the cultures show the bacterial density at the start (0\u2009h), in the middle (3\u2009h) and at the end (5\u2009h) of the experiments. (B) Bacterial growth was measured by the oCelloScope segmentation and extraction of surface area (SESA) algorithm. The applied GA concentrations are indicated in the legend. All data shown represent the mean value and SEM of three independent experiments, each in replicates of two.\n\n## Fast-acting bactericidal effects of GA and LL-37 on \nTo further investigate the type of growth retardation exhibited by GA, we used flow cytometry-based assays enabling the immediate assessment of bacterial viability. We investigated the antimicrobial properties of GA and LL-37 on the laboratory strains of S. aureus (Fig.\u00a02A), E. coli (Fig.\u00a02B) and P. aeruginosa (Fig.\u00a02C). With the indications of a fast acting effect, we chose to stain the samples after 30\u2009min of incubation. For comparison, S. aureus was exposed to vancomycin, while E. coli and P. aeruginosa were exposed to piperacillin/tazobactam. Cell killing positive controls were made by isopropanol treatment, with the concentration (10%) adjusted to maintain a population of morphologically intact cells permitting flow cytometric analysis. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI), staining only cells with a permabilized, damaged membrane, and SYTO\u00ae 9 staining both damaged and undamaged cells. To aid precise counting of cells, a fixed number of microspheres were added to each experiment. By stopping sample inclusion after \u223c10,000 counts in the microspheres gate, high comparability was ensured between experiments.Figure 2Flow cytometric analysis of S. aureus (A), E. coli (B) and P. aeruginosa (C), exposed to either 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml of LL-37, 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml of GA, antibiotics or 10% isopropanol. Experiments were carried out in PBS supplemented with 40\u2009mg/ml human serum albumin. Bacteria were incubated with two nucleic acid stains; red-fluorescent PI and green-fluorescent SYTO 9. PI penetrates only bacteria with disrupted membranes. In contrary, SYTO 9 stains all bacteria in a population. From these stains, flow cytometric plots were divided into four quadratic gates (Q1-Q4) as indicated with black lines. For each gate, the percentage of total events is stated. Gate Q3 contained viable bacteria, with strong green fluorescence (SYTO 9) and weak red fluorescence intensity (PI). Q1, Q2, and Q4 contained dead bacteria and fragments of bacteria. For antibiotic comparisons, S. aureus was treated with vancomycin, whereas E. coli and P. aeruginosa were exposed to piperacillin/tazobactam. The results shown are representative of a total of four independent experiments.\nFor all bacterial species tested (Fig.\u00a02), the PI/SYTO 9 staining identified major distinct populations of cells in addition to cells with intermediate staining patterns, consistent with other observations using this methodology28. Untreated bacteria presented a largely homogenous population of 80\u201395% of all cells in quadrangle (Q) 3, strongly stained for the green-fluorescent SYTO 9 and only weakly stained by the red-fluorescent PI. All cell-killing agents used in our study, including isopropanol, favoured in general the formation of cell populations highly stained with both PI and SYTO 9 (Q2) or SYTO 9-dim events with a high PI stain (Q1). However, as illustrated by data from a representative experiment (Fig.\u00a02), interesting differences were noted between the treated bacteria and the types of treatment.\nFor S. aureus, the combined populations of PI-positive events (Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2) reached \u223c11% following treatment with 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml GA and \u223c28% for LL-37 treatment at the same concentration, compared with only 3% in the case of untreated S. aureus or 32% when treated with isopropanol. This process was driven by increased events in both Q1 and Q2. An increase in a subpopulation of PI-positive events in Q1 with decreased SYTO 9 intensity (<103) followed exposure to both LL-37 and GA (Fig.\u00a02A).\nIn the case of the Gram-negative species, a 5\u20138-fold increase in the events in Q1 was observed, with narrowly confined borders in SYTO 9 staining. No change was observed in Q2 (Fig.\u00a02B,C). Among the tested organisms and conditions, the high efficacy of GA against P. aeruginosa was striking, with the populations in Q1 after GA treatment comprising 80% of all events, exceeding LL-37 at 70%, and reaching levels comparable to isopropanol at 92%. E. coli was also susceptible to GA treatment, although less so than P. aeruginosa, with the dead cells reaching a level of 16% following treatment versus 5% without treatment.\nThe relative dose-response levels in cell killing was investigated using the flow cytometry stains and absolute enumeration described above. The increase in PI-positive cells (\u0394PI in Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2) was measured together with enumeration of the combined events in Q1, Q2, and Q4 versus the events in Q3 enumerating PI-negative/SYTO 9 positive, live cells28. To simplify comparison between the independent experiments, results were reported relative to untreated bacteria (Fig.\u00a03). Increasing concentrations of LL-37 and GA resulted in gradually higher PI positivity for all bacterial species, with a particularly noteworthy result for P. aeruginosa, reaching equivalent levels for LL-37 and GA at 50% using 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml (Fig.\u00a03A). The dose-dependency was tested in a Kruskal-Wallis analysis comparing the dosage groups. For P. aeruginosa groups differed significantly for LL-37 (p\u2009<\u20090.03), GA (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), but not for piperacillin/tazobactam (p\u2009<\u20090.97). The strong PI staining of P. aeruginosa treated with GA was associated with a three-fold increase in the events in Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4, differing significantly from the dose-dependent change in events in Q3 at 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml GA as analysed by a Mann-Whitney test (p\u2009<\u20090.03). Treatment of E. coli produced a quantitatively weaker response. However, as for P. aeruginosa, dosage groups differed significantly in PI staining for treatment with LL-37 (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), GA (p\u2009<\u20090.0005), but not for piperacillin/tazobactam (p\u2009<\u20090.27). The increase in events in Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4 reached approximately two-fold for treatment with LL-37 (p\u2009<\u20090.03) and GA (p\u2009<\u20090.03), with approximately the same dose-dependency between PI staining and Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4 events. For S. aureus, groups differed significantly for treatment with LL-37 (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and vancomycin (p\u2009<\u20090.02), but not for GA (p\u2009<\u20090.15). When using LL-37, S. aureus produced the weakest response in PI staining among the three bacterial stains, but the largest increase in the Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4 events at 5-fold using 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml LL-37 (p\u2009<\u20090.03). Similarly, for GA treatment, the PI staining of S. aureus was less than 10%, however, the number of events still increased approximately 3-fold at a concentration of 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml (p\u2009<\u20090.03). Unlike the antibiotics treatment of the Gram-negative species, vancomycin treatment of S. aureus significantly enhanced the PI staining (p\u2009<\u20090.02) and the events in Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4 compared to Q1 (p\u2009<\u20090.03).Figure 3Quantification of antimicrobial activity of GA compared with LL-37 and classic antibiotics using flow cytometry. (A) For each species of bacteria (S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa) and each type of treatment (LL-37, GA, or antibiotics), the plots show the change in events in Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4 or Q3 as a function of the applied concentration of antimicrobial relative to untreated bacteria (Q10\u2009+\u2009Q20\u2009+\u2009Q40 and Q30, respectively). The antimicrobial-induced change in percentage of PI-positive bacterial cells is shown as a function of the concentration applied antimicrobial. For each concentration, the change (\u0394PI) was calculated by subtracting the percentage of PI-positive cells in untreated cells (typically less than 5%) from the percentage in the treated cells. Hatched lines indicate the level of PI staining induced by treatment with 10% (v/v) isopropanol. (B) Kinetics of bacterial killing. P. aeruginosa (PAO1) was treated with 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml GA in PBS. Bacteria were stained with a mixture of SYTO 9 and PI. Bacterial survival was monitored over 30\u2009min and determined as described in Materials and Methods. Data points were fitted by linear regression. The black line depicts the decrease in viable (Q3) bacteria and the grey line represents the increase of dead bacteria and fragments of dead bacteria (Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4). All data shown represent the mean value and SEM of four independent experiments.\nThe time-dependent killing by GA were resolved in the flow cytometric assay and showed an almost immediate antibacterial activity upon contact with P. aeruginosa (PAO1) (Fig.\u00a03B). The increased number of events in Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4 and corresponding decrease in Q3 showed a statistically significant, linear dependency between time duration and killing, with the same-magnitude rate change (\u03b1) also indicating that the assay captured all cells in the experiments.\nAs an extension on the test on the bactericidal activity of GA and LL-37, the relative number of colony-forming units (CFU) was compared following treatment according to the protocols for the experiments analysed by flow cytometry. To increase the number of Gram-negative species under consideration, Acinetobacter baumannii was also included in these analyses, with one multiresistant clinical isolate (AUH 149) and one antibiotic-susceptible isolate (AUH 351). Treatment with GA caused a reduction in as much as 75% of viable Gram-negative bacteria after only 30\u2009min of treatment (Fig.\u00a04A). Both E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii were affected. Among the two A. baumannii isolates, only the antibiotics susceptible isolate (AUH 351) produced statistical significant results (p\u2009<\u20090.03) with a strong trend for the multiresistant isolate as well (p\u2009<\u20090.06). In P. aeruginosa, treatment with 25 or 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml of GA reduced the CFU almost to the detection limit. From a quantitative perspective, this striking reduction in CFU counts for P. aeruginosa (Fig.\u00a04A) indicated a more pronounced killing than was found with the flow cytometric assays (Fig.\u00a03A). In general treatment with LL-37 produced weaker responses, ranking the two reagents similarly to the findings with flow cytometry.Figure 4Antimicrobial effects of GA and LL-37 on bacterial laboratory strains and clinical isolates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa evaluated from colony-forming units (CFU). (A) Late-log phase S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa (PAO1), and two clinical isolates of A. baumanii were treated with GA or LL-37 for 30\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After exposure to LL-37 and GA in PBS, bacteria were plated on blood agar plates and the number of CFUs counted. The results shown represent the mean values of four independent experiments with SEM. \u201c*\u201d indicates a statistically significant differences (p\u2009<\u20090.05) from untreated bacteria in a Kruskal-Wallis test with correction for multiple comparisons. (B) Analysis of GA\u2019s antimicrobial activity in 44 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from CF patients. Based on raw OD600 readings, the isolates were divided into three groups (resistant, slow susceptible, and fast susceptible). For each strain, results are presented as normalized to the final OD600 reading after 30\u2009min for untreated control (ODCtrl). (C) Analysis of GA\u2019s antimicrobial activity in clinical isolates by CFU counting. One resistant (R21, named according to Supplementary Table\u00a01), two slow susceptible (SS5 & SS6), and two fast susceptible (FS5 & FS13) isolates were plated, either with or without GA treatment as for the experiments quantified by OD600. The fraction of CFU from treated bacteria was expressed in % of untreated controls with 100% expressing no change (indicated with a hatched, grey line). For each strain, CFU were counted from 4\u201310 plates for GA-treated cells as well as for controls. Bars indicate the mean value and error bars SEM.\nA more limited effect was recorded in treatments of S. aureus similar to the flow cytometry results. Neither LL-37 nor GA were able to strikingly reduce colony formation, and no dose-response was detectable for GA treatment of S. aureus in concentrations \u226510\u2009\u00b5g/ml.\nDifferent strains of P. aeruginosa vary in their susceptibility to AMPs29,30. Whether mucoid or not and sensitivity to antibiotics of the isolates were characterized (Suppl. Table\u00a01). We assessed the influence of GA in suspensions of 44\u2009P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. Tested isolates had a range of resistance profiles from broad sensitivity to representatives from each of the major antibiotic classes, to a variety of multidrug resistance patterns (including one isolate that was colistin resistant). As before, the response to GA was monitored over a 30-min period in phosphate-buffered saline. Responses of the 44 isolates fell consistently into one of three patterns: i) fast susceptibility responders, showing a reduction in OD600 at first measurement (i.e., ~5\u2009mins after addition of GA), comprising 34% the isolates; ii) slower susceptibility responders, with initial OD600 similar to controls but exhibiting a decrease during the 30-min monitored period, comprising 16% of isolates, and iii) resistant isolates, a group with an apparent lack of response over the entire 30-min period, comprising 50% of the isolates (Fig.\u00a04B). The susceptibility of each individual isolate was consistent upon replicate and repeat testing. Susceptibility was not related to being mucoid or not or antibiotic resistance as probed with \u03c72 tests (p\u2009=\u20090.485 and p\u2009=\u20090.896, respectively).\nTo confirm that the OD600 changes obtained reflected bacterial killing, representative isolates from apparently GA sensitive and resistant groups were treated as above and serial dilutions, plating and colony counting was performed. Over all, the results confirmed the influence of GA largely as assessed by the OD measurements. For one resistant strain, viability assessed by CFU at 30\u2009mins remained at 111% of the control (R21 in Fig.\u00a04C). For those strains categorised as GA-sensitive, CFU counting revealed that OD may have been underestimating the killing effect. For the fast susceptible strains FS5 and FS13, the viability was 32% and 15% in CFU counting (Fig.\u00a04C) while the OD measurements indicated only a viability loss of 76% and 82%, respectively. Similarly, for the slow susceptible strain SS6, the CFU counting found a viability of 39% (Fig.\u00a04C), while OD measurement suggested a viability of 88%. A similar observation was made in parallel with P. aeruginosa (PAO1), where CFU counting found a viability of only 1.3%, similar to the data in Fig.\u00a04A, while OD measurements suggested a viability of 72%. For another slow susceptible clinical strain SS5, estimates were similar with the two techniques at 90% for CFU counting (Fig.\u00a04C) and 92% for OD measurement. Assessment at 30\u2009mins, however, was unlikely to be optimal for such a strain.\n\n## GA antimicrobial activity persist in plasma and pre-formed biofilms\nMany AMPs lack antimicrobial activity in blood or other biologically relevant liquids5,31\u201333. Moreover, many bacterial species, including P. aeruginosa, form biofilms as part of infection, which limits the action of AMPs.\nWe analysed the killing of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) by GA in human serum and plasma in side-by-side experiments with LL-37, which is known to retain activity under these conditions34. Bacterial survival, enumeration and statistical analyses were evaluated by flow cytometry as described above with the incubation time of 30\u2009min (Fig.\u00a03). Unlike experiments in albumin-supplemented buffer (Fig.\u00a03), the number of events in Q4 were relatively high, even without treatment (Fig.\u00a05A), causing relatively moderate changes in Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4 as part of the treatment with GA or LL-37 (Fig.\u00a05B). Reduction of events in Q3 proved a more robust measure (Fig.\u00a05B), but this came with the emergence of a PI negative/SYTO 9 dim population in Q4, which is difficult to rationalize in terms of viability (Fig.\u00a05A). By contrast, although the PI stain was somewhat attenuated in both serum and plasma, the percentage-positive cells was nevertheless sufficient for concluding that bacterial killing occurred and that GA worked much better than LL-37 (Fig.\u00a05B). To validate these findings further, we also tested the effects by the CFU counting assay used above under conditions with 50% (v/v) human plasma (Fig.\u00a05C). This corroborated the impression from the flow cytometric PI stain, with GA working markedly better than LL-37. Indeed, as noted above, the effect of GA seemed even a stronger antimicrobial agent in this assay than in the flow cytometric analyses.Figure 5Flow cytometric analysis of antimicrobial activity for GA and LL-37 in human serum and plasma. (A) Bacterial isolates of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) were incubated with varying concentrations of LL-37 or GA or left untreated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min either in plasma or serum. After exposure to GA or LL-37, bacterial cell samples were stained with a mixture of SYTO 9 and PI. (B) Plots of the change in events in Q1\u2009+\u2009Q2\u2009+\u2009Q4 or Q3 as a function of the applied concentration of antimicrobial (2\u201350\u2009\u00b5g/ml) relative to untreated bacteria. The antimicrobial-induced change in percentage of PI-positive bacterial cells is shown as a function of the concentration GA or LL-37. For each concentration, the change (\u0394PI) was calculated by subtracting the percentage of PI-positive cells in untreated from treated cells. The results shown represent average values of four independently generated sets of data. SEM are shown as error bars on the curves. (C) Antimicrobial effects of GA and LL-37 on P. aeruginosa (PAO1) in human plasma-containing buffer evaluated by CFU counts. P. aeruginosa was treated with 25 or 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml LL-37 or GA in PBS with 50% (v/v) fresh human plasma, followed by plating and counting as above. (ND, not detected).\nThe formation of biofilms, such as those associated with chronic infections, may significantly limit the action by antimicrobial agents for example, by trapping cationic agents in neutralizing DNA complexes or maintaining a pH incompatible with antimicrobial function35. To test the effect of GA on preformed biofilms, biofilms of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) were cultivated in flow chambers. LL-37 was included in side-by-side experiments using 640\u2009\u00b5g/ml for both compounds, previously determined for LL-37 as the minimal concentration for biofilm eradication in experiments lasting 24 h36. After 3\u2009h of incubation, both compounds induced a strong PI staining (Fig.\u00a06A). The average survival of P. aeruginosa in biofilm exposed to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), LL-37, or GA for 3\u2009hours was 91%, 34% and 37%, respectively (Fig.\u00a06B). This indicated that the activity of GA was similar to that of LL-37 on preformed P. aeruginosa biofilms.Figure 6Antimicrobial effects of GA and LL-37 against preformed P. aeruginosa biofilms. (A) LIVE/DEAD staining of P. aeruginosa (PAO1) biofilms, initially grown for 24\u2009h in IBIDI flow cells and treated for 3\u2009h with 640\u2009\u00b5g/ml LL-37 or GA. Living cells are stained with SYTO 9 (green) and dead cells are stained with PI (red). Scale bar 50\u2009\u00b5m. (B) Quantification of the percentage of live cells in the biofilms after LL-37 or GA treatment or as untreated. Data were from two experiments with each average and standard deviation calculated from 10 images.\n\n## LL-37 and GA induces an envelope stress response in \nThe flow cytometric characterization of cellular responses to GA and LL-37 suggested that formation of smaller fragments played a part in the contact with the bacterial cells, especially in the case of S. aureus. To gain further insight into the nature of these processes through better size resolution than provided by flow cytometry, we quantified the responses by use of nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).\nWe recently demonstrated that NTA measurement enables a high sensitivity in measuring damage to cell membranes25. Moreover, this technique also measures the size of particles into the nm-regimen, enabling ultrastructural characterization of AMP-induced fragmentation of bacteria. To our knowledge, this approach has not previously been applied in analysis of bacterial fragment formation. NTA was conducted on supernatants from suspensions of the laboratory strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa following exposure to either LL-37 or GA and compared with that of untreated bacteria (Fig.\u00a07). For all conditions and species, the particulate material varied in size between \u223c80\u2013500\u2009nm. Both in the untreated condition as well as following LL-37 and GA exposure, S. aureus-derived supernatants presented pronounced spikes in the particle distribution. By contrast, supernatants from the Gram-negative species had a smoother profile (Fig.\u00a07A). In S. aureus, LL-37 or GA treatment provoked a higher abundance of particles with a size of \u223c90\u2009nm. The change in size distribution towards a smaller size of the particles was clear from comparison in a cumulative plot (Fig.\u00a07B). The cumulative distributions were compared in a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, where the LL-37 and GA treated samples differed significantly from the untreated sample (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 and p\u2009<\u20090.0006, respectively). A similar phenomenon was discernible in the analysis of E. coli (Fig.\u00a07A,B) for GA treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.002), but not for LL-37 treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.30). The size distribution of particles produced by P. aeruginosa was essentially unaffected by LL-37 or GA treatment (Fig.\u00a07A,B) although a small significant difference was found between GA treated and untreated samples was found (p\u2009<\u20090.01), but not for the LL-37 treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.08).Figure 7Size distribution of nanoparticulate material in supernatant from S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa exposed to 50\u2009\u00b5g/ml of LL-37 or GA. (A) Major debris was cleared from the bacterial supernatants following exposure to either LL-37 or GA or in untreated cultures as described in the Materials and Methods section. The sizes (diameters) of the nanoparticulate material in the nine types of supernatants were quantified by NTA using the NanoSight\u2122 instrument. To facilitate a direct comparison between the size distribution profiles, for each supernatant the concentration of each size of particle was normalized to the total concentration of particles. The normalized concentration of particles was indicated with a solid, black line representing a mean value from three independent experiments, surrounded by a grey area to indicate standard error of the mean. Orange arrows indicate predominant peaks (with sizes in nm). In each panel, three-dimensional graphs show the raw data collected (size vs. intensity vs. concentration) from one representative experiment. (B) To further enable comparison between the treatments, the size profiles from the three experiments for each bacterial species were presented in a cumulative plot, each curve representing treatments with GA (blue line), LL-37 (black line) or no treatment (red line).\nClosely adhering to the conditions used above, TEM imaging was made of S. aurueus following treatment with either LL-37 (Fig.\u00a08A & S1A) or GA (Fig.\u00a08B & S1B). These bacteria appeared largely undamaged from comparison with untreated cells (Fig.\u00a08C & S1C), consistent with the lack of killing of this bacterium observed above. Occasional burst of the cells was observed in treatment with GA (Fig.\u00a0S1B), but too in frequent to assign this as an effect of GA (Fig.\u00a08B). On the other hand, agreeing with the observations made with NTA, a large number of smaller particulates were also observable following LL-37 or GA treatment (Fig.\u00a08A,B). These structures appeared after exposure to LL-37 and GA and had a size of 50\u2013150\u2009nm.Figure 8TEM images of S. aureus (A\u2013C), E. coli (D\u2013F), and P. aeruginosa (G\u2013I) exposed to LL-37 (A,D,G), GA (B,E,H), or left as untreated (C,F,I). In the images of S. aureus, black arrows show debris or microvesicles following treatment with either LL-37 or GA. In the image of P. aeruginosa after treatment with GA, the arrow heads highlight cells with a condensate similar to those seen with GA-treated E. coli. Images are representative of two independent experiments, sampling on average 10 images per condition and species in each experiment.
