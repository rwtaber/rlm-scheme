  "abstract": "The worldwide emergence and spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria endangers the efficacy of current antibiotics in the clinical setting. The lack of new antibiotics in the pipeline points to the need of developing new strategies. Recently, gold-based drugs are being repurposed for antibacterial applications. Among them, gold(III) complexes have received increasing attention as metal-based anticancer agents. However, reports on their antibacterial activity are scarce due to stability issues. The present work demonstrates the antibacterial activity of the gold(III) complex 2 stabilized as C\u2227S-cycloaurated containing a diphenylphosphinothioic amide moiety, showing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values that ranged from 4 to 8 and from 16 to 32 mg/L among Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, respectively. Complex 2 has a biofilm inhibitory activity of only two to four times than its MIC. We also describe for the first time a potent antibacterial synergistic effect of a gold(III) complex combined with colistin, showing a bactericidal effect in less than 2 h; confirming the role of the outer membrane as a permeability barrier. Complex 2 shows a low rate of internalization in Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii; it does not interact with replication enzymes or efflux pumps, causes ultrastructural damages in both membrane and cytoplasmic levels, and permeabilizes the bacterial membrane. Unlike control antibiotics, complex 2 did not generate resistant mutants in 30-day sequential cultures. We detected lower cytotoxicity in a non-tumoral THLE-2 cell line (IC50 = 25.5 \u03bcM) and no acute toxicity signs in vivo after an i.v. 1-mg/kg dose. The characterization presented here reassures the potential of complex 2 as a new chemical class of antimicrobial agents.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAmong the many challenges to health, infectious diseases stand out for their ability to have a deep impact on humans and, therefore, have become a public health priority worldwide. Yet, the treatment of such infectious diseases remains a significant and global threat due to the emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) or even pan-resistant pathogens refractory to virtually all clinically used antibiotics (Boucher et al., 2009). According to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections were reported in the United States in 2019, leading to more than 35,000 deaths (CDC, 2019). In Europe, it is estimated that more than 650,000 people suffer from infections caused by MDR bacteria each year, and 33,000 people die as a result. In February 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a list of antibiotic-resistant priority pathogens that pose the greatest threat to human health. The panel of experts heartily recommended that future R + D strategies should be focused on the discovery and development of new antibiotics specifically active against MDR Gram-negative bacteria (Shrivastava et al., 2018).\nSince 2017, only two new antibiotics contain a new active substance (vaborbactam\u2013meropenem and lefamulin), and the remaining pipeline consists mostly of reformulations of already existing antibiotics with conventional targets (Theuretzbacher et al., 2020; World Health Organization [WHO], 2020). Bacteria not only exist as planktonic cells but they can adhere to surfaces and form structured communities, commonly named biofilms. Biofilm-mediated infections are frequently untreatable, thus, being of great medical concern. Even if several synthetic and natural compounds have shown antibiofilm activity against resistant bacterial strains, the arsenal of antibiofilm agents is still very limited (Davies, 2003; Batoni et al., 2016). This clearly points to the need of novel antibacterial compounds, preferably from new chemical classes with new mechanisms of action.\nMetal-containing compounds are the focus of great interest as innovative antibacterial agents (Frei, 2020; Frei et al., 2020). The form of the metal (e.g., coordination or organometallic complexes, nanoparticles), the oxidation state, the coordination numbers, and the ligands offer practically endless options for fine tuning their biocidal properties (Claudel et al., 2020; Saidin et al., 2021). In this regard, gold-based compounds are attracting much interest as antimicrobial agents. However, the use of gold in medicinal preparations goes back many of thousands of years. Ancient cultures, such as those in India (Parimalam et al., 2021) and Egypt (Higby, 1982) used gold-based medicines to treat diseases, but the first reports of the use of gold to cure sickness were found in China and date back as far as 2500 BC (Huaizhi and Yuantao, 2001). In modern medicine, gold compounds started to get noticed precisely for their antibacterial properties, when Robert Koch discovered at the end of the 19th century that potassium dicyanidoaurate(I) effectively inhibited Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in cultures (Benedek, 2004). In the 1920s of the last century, Jacques Forestier used gold(I) polymeric thiolates for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Kean et al., 1985). However, the turning point was the work of Sutton, who developed the orally administrable Au(I)-based drug auranofin in 1986 (Sutton, 1986). Since then, interest in the use of gold complexes in medicinal chemistry has grown exponentially.\nThe emergence of MDR bacteria has led to research on repurposing existing clinical molecules as antimicrobials. Such an effort led to the discovery of the potent antibacterial activity of antirheumatic gold(I) complex auranofin (Roder and Thomson, 2015). Subsequently, a relatively large number of gold(I) complexes have been synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity (Balfourier et al., 2020). Recently, it was reported that the exchange of sulfur-containing ligands in auranofin with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands led to the formation of linear gold(I) complexes showing interesting biological profiles (Baker et al., 2005). In recent years, medicinal applications of gold(I)\u2013NHC complexes focused mostly on their anticancer activity (Samanta et al., 2015; Mora et al., 2019; Patil et al., 2020; Behera et al., 2021; Guarra et al., 2021). In contrast, notably fewer contributions describing significant antimicrobial activities have been reported (Roymahapatra et al., 2012; Samanta et al., 2013; B\u00fcssing et al., 2021; Hussaini et al., 2021; Jakob et al., 2021).\nGold(III) complexes have been intensively investigated as potential antitumor agents due to their similarities with platinum(II) complexes (Rana et al., 2018; Radisavljevi\u0107 and Petrovi\u0107, 2020; Tong et al., 2020). Only recently, the growing threat of MDR pathogens has drawn attention to the application of these compounds also as antimicrobials (Gli\u0161i\u0107 and Djuran, 2014; Dominelli et al., 2018). Gold(III) complexes that are stable in the biological media are based primarily on cyclometallated derivatives bearing C\u2227N pincer-type ligands (Chakraborty et al., 2021) due to the increased stability toward thiol-containing cellular reducing agents provided by the presence of at least one gold(III)\u2013carbon \u03c3 bond (Jurgens et al., 2018).\nAntibiofilm applications of gold complexes have been even less investigated. In this regard, bis-imidazolium gold(I) complexes displayed effective inhibition and eradication of pathogenic biofilms (Samanta et al., 2013). Recently, Pintus et al. (2017) reported a heteroleptic cyclometallated gold(III) complex containing C-deprotonated 2-benzylpyridine and 1,2-dicyanoethene-1,2-dithiolate bidentate ligands, which inhibited Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation up to a concentration of 3.125 \u03bcg/ml. The bacterial toxicity of gold(III) complexes is assigned to non-specific simultaneous mechanisms, which significantly hampers the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Although the precise molecular mechanisms of antibacterial gold compounds remain unknown, there is evidence on them targeting thiol-containing proteins via ligand exchange because of the strong affinity of sulfur to gold ions. This process could affect many proteins, and their binding to gold(III) ions may prevent them from performing their function. In addition, the easy reduction of Au(III) to Au(I) may cause disruption of redox and metal homeostasis (Chandrangsu et al., 2017; Balfourier et al., 2020). Both mechanisms may lead to bacterial cell death. The nucleophilic displacement of bromide in gold(III) complexes by free cysteine residues of proteins has been established by electrospray ionization \u2013 mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) studies (Massai et al., 2020).\nThe use of antibiotics in combination with different natural or synthetic compounds has recently emerged as an alternative strategy to overcome the problem of bacterial resistance (Leite et al., 2016; Moussaoui and Alaoui, 2016). Several organic and inorganic compounds have been reported to enhance the antibacterial activity of commonly used antibiotics against many resistant bacteria. Among them, metallic ions and metallic nanoparticles have been particularly promising when used in combination with several antibiotics in different Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains (Hwang et al., 2012; Shabatina, 2018). In connection with those findings, recent reports suggest that a combination therapy of antibiotics and gold materials, such as gold ions, could display a synergistic effect (Rai et al., 2010; Nazari et al., 2012). The only report in which the conventional antibiotic norfloxacin is coordinated to gold(III) shows that this complex exhibited higher activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the reference antibiotic due to a synergistic effect (Refat, 2007). Using a single agent to treat bacterial infections in the clinical setting appears to have become less effective and, therefore, combination therapy has been chosen as treatment in cases of complicated infections. In this sense, the coordination of gold complexes to antibiotics may (i) enhance the activity of the selected antimicrobial agents; (ii) prevent or delay the emergence of resistances; and (iii) decrease required doses, reducing both costs and the chances of toxic effects (Walsh and Wencewicz, 2014).\nWe have previously reported the synthesis of phosphinic amide and phosphinothioic amide C\u2227X-cycloaurated complexes [Au(dppa)Cl2], 1 (X = O, dppa = diphenylphosphinic amide) (O\u00f1a-Burgos et al., 2009) and [Au(dppta)Cl2], 2 (X = S, dppta = diphenylphosphinothioic amide) (Belmonte-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2017) (Figure 1A). In view of the Au\u2013halogen exchangeability in these complexes (Soengas et al., 2018) and the structural similarity with C\u2227N-cyclometallated gold(III) compounds showing antimicrobial properties (Gli\u0161i\u0107 and Djuran, 2014; Jurgens et al., 2018; Chakraborty et al., 2021), we decided to investigate the activity of organometallic complexes 1 and 2 together with a new derivative 3 containing a penicillamine ligand against selected MDR bacteria. Subsequently, we evaluated in-depth the potential of the active complex 2 as a new antimicrobial agent and shed light on its bacterial mechanism of action by characterizing its (i) antibacterial and biofilm inhibitory activity against a wide panel of clinically relevant bacteria with a clear representation of pathogens listed on the WHO Priority List, (ii) synergy with current antimicrobials from different functional categories, (iii) bacterial intracellular uptake, (iv) interaction with DNA replication enzymes and efflux pumps, (v) ultrastructural changes in bacterial morphology after treatment, (vi) membrane permeabilization effect, (vii) ability to generate bacterial resistance, (viii) in vitro cytotoxicity in tumoral and non-tumoral cell lines, (ix) hemolytic activity, and (x) in vivo acute toxicity.\n\n## Chemistry\nReactions requiring an inert atmosphere were conducted under dry nitrogen, and the glassware was oven dried (120\u00b0C). All reagents were commercially available and were used without further purification. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance III HD 300 (1H, 300.13 MHz; 13C, 75.47 MHz; and 31P, 121.49 MHz), Bruker Avance III HD 500 (1H, 500.13 MHz; 13C, 125.76 MHz; 15N, 50.68 MHz; and 31P, 202.46 MHz), and Bruker Avance III HD 600 (1H, 600.13 MHz; and 31P, 242.95 MHz). Chemical shifts are given in ppm using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard for 1H and 13C, and liquid NH3 for 15N and 85% H3PO4 for 31P as external standards. The following abbreviations are used to indicate the multiplicity of signals: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; and sep, septet. When two diastereoisomers are characterized together, many 1H and 13C signals appeared overlapped. To simplify the description of the NMR data, overlapped signals are indicated with a single label. Signals arising from different diastereoisomers are distinguished by a prime after the number of the atom. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Alpha FTIR instrument and registered in KBr pellets. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on an Agilent Technologies LC/MSD-TOF and HP 1100 MSD spectrometer using electrospray ionization. Melting points were recorded on a B\u00fcchi B-540 capillary melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-530 polarimeter. Single crystal x-ray diffraction data were collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer at 100 K, using CuK\u03b1 (\u03bb = 1.54178 \u00c5) radiation (see Supplementary Material for additional details). Complexes 1 (O\u00f1a-Burgos et al., 2009) and 2 (Belmonte-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2017) have been prepared following previously reported procedures. Their 1H and 31P-NMR spectra are in good agreement with those described in the literature. 1H NMR data of complex 2 in different solvents used in this study are included in the Supplementary Material. The procedure for the synthesis of complex 3 and its structural characterization are described in the Supplementary Material.\n\n## Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Antibiotics\nThe activity of the gold(III) compound 2 was evaluated against clinically relevant isolates, selected based on their resistance phenotype, etiology, and biofilm production. The panel of microorganisms included MDR and/or biofilm-producing strains collected from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) of P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant/susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli. The panel also included eight Salmonella spp. (including five quinolone-resistant strains) and six Burkholderia cepacia complex strains, which were collected from the Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias (Oviedo, Spain) and Hospital Ram\u00f3n y Cajal (Madrid, Spain).\nIsolates were routinely grown on Columbia sheep blood agar (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h with some exceptions. B. cepacia complex strains were cultured for 48 h, and the H. influenzae isolates were grown in chocolate blood agar containing IsoVitaleX, at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Reference strains S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 29213, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, H. influenzae ATCC 49247, E. coli ATCC 25922, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, and ATCC 17978 were added as controls. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI\u2013TOF) mass spectrometry was used to confirm species identification.\nStock solutions for control antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP), tobramycin (TOB), colistin (CST), and daptomycin (DAP) were prepared according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Experiments with DAP were carried out in media containing 50 \u03bcg/ml of Ca2+.\n\n## Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Determination\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by broth microdilution method following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (CLSI, 2020). Stock solutions of 2 were prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) at 6,000 mg/L and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use. First, serial two-fold dilutions of 2 ranging from 128 to 0.25 mg/L were performed in ISO-Sensitest broth or Haemophilus Test Medium (HTM) broth for H. influenzae isolates in 96-well round-bottom microtiter plates. After 18 h of incubation in agar plates, bacterial colonies were resuspended in 0.9% NaCl to reach a 0.5 McFarland (equivalent to 1.5 \u00d7 108 colony forming unit (CFU)/ml) and then diluted to obtain a final concentration in the well of 5 \u00d7 105 CFU/ml. In addition, control antibiotics CIP and TOB, and serial two-fold dilutions of DMSO at the same concentration as in the 2 assays were added as a control. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h (with 5% CO2 for H. influenzae isolates) and were visually read for the absence of turbidity.\nMIC values were defined as the lowest concentration of the compound that inhibited visible growth. All the experiments were carried out by triplicate.\n\n## Biofilm Inhibitory Studies\nThe biofilm inhibitory activity of 2 was determined against the biofilm-forming strains included in the study. Serial two-fold dilutions of 2 ranging from 256 to 0.5 mg/L were performed in flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plates, with the corresponding culture media to enhance biofilm formation. Luria Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 0.25% glucose was used for P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii strains; M63 with 0.25% glucose for E. coli; TSB with 0.25% glucose for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. maltophilia; Tryptic soy broth (TSB) diluted 1/20 for Salmonella spp., and supplemented brain\u2013heart infusion (sBHI) broth for H. influenzae strains. Bacterial suspensions were prepared from overnight cultures, and the turbidity was adjusted to a 0.5 McFarland in the corresponding media for each species and consequently diluted to reach an inoculum of 5 \u00d7 106 CFU/well. For P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia complex assays, biofilms were formed by immersing pegs of a modified polystyrene microtiter lid (Nunc TSP System, Nunc, Rockslide, Denmark). After 48 h incubation at 37\u00b0C in static, biofilms on microtiter plates or pegs were carefully rinsed three times with 1 \u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to discard planktonic cells and exposed at 65\u00b0C until completely dry. Biofilms were then fully covered with a 1% crystal violet (CV) stain solution for 10 min at room temperature (Stepanovi\u0107 et al., 2007). The CV was then removed, washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS to eliminate the excess of dye and heat-dried for 60 min. Biofilm formation was quantified by eluting the CV fixed to the biofilm in 33% glacial acetic acid, and absorbance of each well was measured at 580 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (EPOCH, Biotek, Santa Clara, CA, United States).\nThe minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) was defined as the minimal concentration of the compound that led to a three-fold decrease in absorbance when compared with the growth control values. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate.\n\n## Quantification of Gold(III) Complex \nTo determine the intracellular uptake of 2, we quantified the Au present in bacterial lysates through inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) after exposure to 2 at different timepoints in S. aureus and in A. baumannii as representatives for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. First, overnight cultures of MRSA 163501-000 and A. baumannii Cr17 were grown to reach an optical density (OD) of 0.6, then harvested and resuspended in ice-cold PBS to a 1 \u00d7 1010 CFU/ml cell density. Bacterial suspensions were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and treated right after with 2 (30 and 20 \u03bcg/ml for S. aureus and A. baumannii, respectively). Aliquots at 0, 5, and 8 min timepoints were immediately centrifuged to a bacterial pellet; washed three times in ice-cold PBS; plated for CFU determination; and frozen until lysis. Bacteria treated only with PBS and stock solution of 2 without bacteria were used as controls. Samples were digested with HNO3, H2O2, and HCl at 60\u00b0C and subsequently diluted in an HCl-thiourea solution. The presence of Au in the samples was detected through ICP-MS in an Agilent 7500ce equipment under standard conditions.\nResults for the Au quantification on the bacterial lysates were analyzed, extrapolated to the 2 quantity, and expressed combined with the total amount of CFU to obtain the amount of 2 internalized by a single CFU (fg/CFU).\n\n## Synergy Testing\nThe activity of 2 in combination with the antibiotics CST and CIP was evaluated by the microdilution two-dimensional checkerboard technique (Garcia and Isenberg, 2014). The setup of each assay plate evaluated two-fold dilutions of 2 with two-fold dilutions of the chosen antimicrobial, considering a concentration range that included, in the middle of the gradient, the MIC of each molecule against the tested strain. Inoculum size, culture media, and incubation conditions were the same as described above for the MIC microdilution method. Results are read at one point in time after 18 h by visual examination.\nThe fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated considering the following formula: FICI = FIC A + FIC B, where FIC A is the MIC of drug A in combination/MIC of drug A alone, and FIC B is the MIC of drug B in combination/MIC of drug B alone. Synergy was defined by an FICI \u2264 0.5. Interactions with FICI values ranging from 0.5 to 4 were classified as additive/indifferent. Antagonism was defined by an FICI \u2265 4 (Saiman, 2007).\n\n## Time-Dependent Killing Assays\nSynergistic results obtained from the checkerboard arrays were confirmed by time-dependent killing assays. Prior to inoculation, each tube of ISO-Sensitest broth was supplemented with 2 either alone or in combination with CST, in concentrations ranging from 0.03 \u00d7 MIC to 2 \u00d7 MIC for both antimicrobials. The tubes were inoculated to reach a bacterial density of 5 \u00d7 105 CFU/ml per tube and incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking. To determine the number of viable bacteria, aliquots were taken at specific time points (0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h), serially diluted 10-fold when needed, and plated onto LB agar. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, and CFUs were enumerated after 18 h.\nSynergy was defined as a \u22652 log decrease in viability (CFU/ml) between the combination and the most active agent alone. The combination had to show also a \u22652 log bacterial reduction compared with the starting inoculum.\n\n## Gyrase and Topoisomerase IV Inhibition Assays\nDNA decatenation and supercoiling enzymatic inhibition assays were performed using topoisomerase IV and gyrase kit by Inspiralis (Norwich, United Kingdom) for both S. aureus and E. coli. For topoisomerase IV assays, 200 ng of double-stranded kDNA was incubated with 2 and comparator antibiotic ciprofloxacin at different concentrations (0.5, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 25 mg/L) in the presence of S. aureus or E. coli Topo IV, in a final volume of 30 \u03bcl. Each test condition was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Negative (DNA substrate with no enzyme or treatment) and positive (DNA substrate and enzyme without treatment) controls served as cutoff values for 100 and 0% inhibition, respectively. Reactions were stopped by adding 30 \u03bcl of STEB buffer (40% sucrose, 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mg/ml of bromophenol blue) and 30 \u03bcl of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). Enzymatic reactions were loaded in 1% agarose gels and stained with SYBR\u2122 Safe (Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom) to observe released minicircles, and bands were quantified with the Gene Tools software (Syngene, Cambridge, United Kingdom).\nFor gyrase supercoiling inhibition assays, 0.5 \u03bcg of relaxed pBR322 was incubated with 2 and ciprofloxacin in a range of concentrations (0.5, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 25 mg/L) in the presence of S. aureus or E. coli DNA gyrase, in a final volume of 30 \u03bcl. Each test condition was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Negative (DNA substrate with no enzyme or treatment) and positive (DNA substrate and enzyme without treatment) controls served as cutoff values for 100 and 0% inhibition, respectively. Reactions were stopped as described above in decatenation assays. The two forms of the plasmid were observed by 1% gel electrophoresis, stained, and quantified in the same manner as for topoisomerase IV assays.\n\n## Activity of Gold(III) Complex \nTo determine if the inhibition of efflux systems compromises the activity of 2, the MIC of the compound in the presence of subinhibitory levels of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) was assessed against selected strains of S. aureus, S. maltophilia, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. Three EPIs were used in this study: phenylalanine-arginine \u03b2-naphthylamide (Pa\u03b2N), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP), and reserpine (RSP). Preliminary microdilution experiments against all strains were performed to define the fixed subinhibitory concentration of the EPIs that would be used in the study, which should be at least two-fold below their MIC. Consequently, each tested microorganism was exposed to Pa\u03b2N at 16 mg/L, CCCP at various concentrations (0.25 mg/L for S. aureus and H. influenzae, 8 mg/L for S. maltophilia and E. coli, and 16 mg/L for P. aeruginosa), and RSP at 8 or 16 mg/L (for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa isolates) in the presence of 2 within a range of 0.25\u2013128 mg/L. Culture conditions were as those described above for the broth microdilution assays. Plates were checked for fold variations in MIC between the activity of 2 alone or in the presence of any of the three EPIs tested.\n\n## Transmission Electron Microscopy Analysis\nBacterial ultrastructural analysis after treatment with 2 was carried out by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. Exponential cultures of MRSA 163501-000, P. aeruginosa 953, and A. baumannii Cr17 were exposed to minimum inhibitory concentrations of 2 and were incubated for 30 min. These cells were consequently fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde, then postfixed for 2 h in 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide. Graded acetone series were used to dehydrate the samples prior to infiltrate an epoxy resin according to the Spurr\u2019s formula. Ultrathin sections were cut with a diamond knife, picked up with Formvar-coated grids and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Samples were examined using a TEM JEOL J1010 microscope charged with a Gatan charge-coupled device (CCD) Orion camera with Digital Micrograph software, under standard operating conditions.\n\n## Bacterial Membrane Permeabilization Assays\nWe evaluated the effect of complex 2 on membrane permeabilization against MRSA 163501-000 and A. baumannii Cr17 using the LIVE/DEAD Baclight\u2122 viability kit (L13152, Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, Illkirch, France) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Bacterial cultures were harvested from logarithmic growth by centrifugation at 3,500 \u00d7 g for 5 min, washed twice, and resuspended in saline to an OD595 = 0.5. Bacterial inoculum was then incubated with 6 \u03bcM SYTO9 and 30 \u03bcM of propidium iodide (PI) in the dark for 30 min. A total of 50 \u03bcl of SYTO9-PI-labeled cells was added to a 96-well plate and exposed to 50 \u03bcl of complex 2 serially diluted in saline, from 64 to 4 mg/L. Untreated controls were also included. The fluorescence intensity (SYTO9 = 480/500 nm excitation/emission; PI = 490/635 nm excitation/emission) was monitored using a Tecan microplate reader (Tecan, InfiniteM2000PRO, Zurich, Switzerland) for 30 min (in 5 min intervals) since the beginning of the exposure. Assays were carried out in triplicate and plotted as the mean \u00b1 SD PI fluorescence signal at each time point after subtracting the untreated control mean PI signal.\n\n## Point of Resistance\nWe performed sequential culturing of S. aureus ATCC 29213 and A. baumannii ATCC 19606 in the presence of subinhibitory levels of 2 in order to increase the probability of obtaining resistant mutants. Bacterial cells were grown in 1 ml of media (ISO-Sensitest broth) containing 2 at different concentrations. DAP and CST were also included as a control for S. aureus and A. baumannii, respectively. Cells grown up to an OD = 1 were diluted 1:100 to complex 2 present at 0.25 \u00d7 MIC, 0.5 \u00d7 MIC, 1 \u00d7 MIC, 2 \u00d7 MIC, 4 \u00d7 MIC, and 8 \u00d7 MIC. At 24-h intervals, the cultures were checked for growth. Cultures from the highest concentration showing bacterial growth were diluted 1:100 into fresh media containing 0.25 \u00d7 MIC, 0.5 \u00d7 MIC, 1 \u00d7 MIC, 2 \u00d7 MIC, 4 \u00d7 MIC, and 8 \u00d7 MIC of 2. This serial passaging was repeated daily for 30 days. Any culture that grew at higher than the MIC levels was passaged on drug-free ISO-Sensitest agar plates, and the MIC was then determined by broth microdilution.\n\n3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based colorimetric assay measures the activity of cellular enzymes that reduce the tetrazolium dye, MTT, to insoluble formazan, giving a purple color. This assay measures mitochondrial metabolic activity via NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes and may, under defined conditions, reflect the number of viable cells.\nThe cells lines used in this study were HepG2 (HB-8065), a perpetual cell line, which was derived from the liver tissue of a 15-year-old Caucasian American male with a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma; and THLE-2, an immortalized human liver cell (left lobe). THLE-2 cells express phenotypic characteristics of normal adult liver epithelial cells and constitute an in vitro model for pharmacotoxicological studies and drug toxicity.\nCells were seeded at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well in 200 \u03bcl of Eagles\u2019s minimum essential medium (MEM) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with a final volume of 200 and 1 \u03bcl of compound (dilution 1/200), and controls were added to the plates. The curve of compound/extract was realized with 1/2 dilution in each step, 10 points by curve in acetonitrile (solvent of 2). Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS, 8 mM) and DMSO (0.5%) were used as positive and negative control, respectively. The doxorubicin curve was used as internal control. Previously, a DMSO curve was tested with these cell lines, and no effects were observed with 1% DMSO. When compounds and controls were added, plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. After this time, MTT solution was prepared at 5 mg/ml in 1 \u00d7 PBS and then diluted at 0.5 mg/ml in MEM without phenol red. The sample solution in the wells was flicked off, and 100 \u03bcl of MTT dye was added to each well. The plates were gently shaken and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 incubator. The supernatant was removed, and 100 \u03bcl of 100% DMSO was added. The plates were gently shaken to solubilize the formed formazan. The absorbance was measured using a multireader Victor\u2122 at a wavelength of 570 nm. Molecule concentration ranged from 50 to 0.09 \u03bcM.\n\n## Hemolytic Activity\nWhole blood from the Banc de Sang i Teixits of Catalonia, according to the recommendation and approval of the Ethics Committee of Clinical Investigation from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, was centrifuged at 2,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min to obtain separated erythrocytes. Cells were washed in 1 \u00d7 PBS three times, and the hematocrit was adjusted to obtain a 1% final concentration in the wells. The suspension was exposed to increasing concentrations of 2 ranging from 150 to 0.09 \u03bcM in 96-well round-bottomed microtiter plates and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 rpm, and the absorbance of supernatants was measured at 540 nm to detect hemoglobin release. A value of 100% hemolysis was determined by incubating erythr",
