  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. A rapid rise in the numbers of COVID\u201019 cases followed (Paules et al.,\u00a02020) and as of January 2022, there have been over 296 million cases of COVID\u201019 and 5.5 million deaths (WHO,\u00a02022). Healthcare systems have been globally overwhelmed (Miller et al.,\u00a02020) and projection studies predict that rapid transmission dynamics will potentially be at play well into 2025 (Kissler et al.,\u00a02020). Viral vector and mRNA vaccines have proved an overwhelming success in controlling the pandemic (Rotshild et al.,\u00a02021) and as of January 2022, nearly 9 billion vaccine doses have been administered (WHO,\u00a02022). However, vaccines alone are unlikely to be sufficient in vulnerable patient populations (i.e. elderly, cancer, primary immune deficiencies, transplant recipients or dialysis) and patients who receive concurrent medical treatments that supress the immune system may not mount a satisfactory antibody response. Additionally, global herd immunity is unlikely to be achieved due to the constant evolution of new variants of concern and waning of natural or stimulated antibody responses over time. Geopolitical logistics and vaccine nationalism also make it unlikely that these vaccines will be equitably available across the globe for a few more years. Therefore, parallel strategies such as effective novel therapeutic interventions must be rapidly developed. Intensive and collaborative research efforts have resulted in a number of treatment options for COVID\u201019. The antivirals, remdesivir (Beigel et al.,\u00a02020) and molnupiravir (Jayk Bernal et al.,\u00a02021), neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab, imdevimab (Somersan\u2010Karakaya et al.,\u00a02021) and sotrovimab (Gupta et al.,\u00a02021), IL\u20106 antibodies, tocilizumab (Gordon et al.,\u00a02021; RECOVERY Collaborative Group,\u00a02021) and dexamethasone (Horby et al.,\u00a02021) are the primary treatment options currently approved for COVID\u201019, but they can result in serious systemic adverse effects and only moderately affect the clinical outcomes. The limitations of these therapies highlight the need for ongoing development of life\u2010saving medications to help fight the virus.\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are large, enveloped, positive sense and single\u2010stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales (Y. Chen et al.,\u00a02020). They can infect several mammalian hosts and are divided into four genera: \u2010 Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, of which Alpha and Beta CoVs are known to infect humans. Full\u2010genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses have indicated that the CoV that causes COVID\u201019 was in the same subgenus as the SARS virus (Fehr & Perlman,\u00a02015) and was named on the basis of its appearance under electron microscopy. Human CoV infections usually cause mild, self\u2010limiting respiratory infection. However, the epidemics of SARS\u2010CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (MERS\u2010CoV) caused alarming morbidity and mortality in 2002\u20132003 and 2012, respectively (Gao et al.,\u00a02016), and COVID\u201019 has underscored the continued risk of pandemics caused by such viruses. Risk factors for severe COVID\u201019 across the globe include old age, race, gender, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease and immunosuppression. Therefore, drugs that target pleiotropic mechanisms may be important. CoVs have a large genome and a higher mutation rate compared with other RNA viruses, hence eradicating them definitively is difficult (Gralinski & Baric,\u00a02015). Broad\u2010spectrum inhibitors of emerging CoVs are therefore needed and repurposing existing drugs has been validated as a means to tackle the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pandemic, as well as enabling future pandemic preparedness.\n\n## REPURPOSING OLD DRUGS FOR A NEW CAUSE\nDrug repurposing has emerged as an attractive alternative to the conventional approach of drug discovery, which is often exhaustive and arduous (Ashburn & Thor,\u00a02004). It is a process of identifying new therapeutic roles for a drug that has already been established for the treatment of another condition. The discovery of a new drug and its journey to the market is a process fraught with risks involving toxicity and lack of efficacy, costing billions of dollars and requiring a long timeline. Repurposing therefore offers several advantages over de novo drug development, such as reduced development timelines, reduced costs and substantially lower risks, as the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of the drug is already established (S. Pushpakom et al.,\u00a02019). The risk of failure is lower because the repurposed drug has been shown to be safe in preclinical models and humans, provided early\u2010stage trials have been completed. As a result, the timeframe for drug development is significantly shorter (Breckenridge & Jacob,\u00a02019).\nHistorically, drug repurposing has been mostly serendipitous, usually after a drug was found to have a newly recognized off\u2010target effect (Nosengo,\u00a02016). Well\u2010known examples are the use of minoxidil for hair loss, sildenafil for erectile dysfunction and thalidomide for multiple myeloma (Pushpakom et al.,\u00a02019). However, recent successes have encouraged the development of more systematic approaches resulting in the identification of a number of promising candidate drugs (Hurle et al.,\u00a02013). In more recent years, drug repurposing screens have emerged as an attractive strategy to respond swiftly to emerging infectious diseases (Ashburn & Thor,\u00a02004). Food and Drug Administration (FDA; U.S.A.)\u2010approved drugs that can achieve a modest antimicrobial activity are a safe and increasingly popular response mechanism to emerging infections. The drugs concerned can be made immediately available for use in clinical trials as they have known safety profiles at the licensed doses and this has had a huge impact during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. For example, dexamethasone was repurposed in the RECOVERY trial (Horby et al.,\u00a02021) and is estimated to have saved 1 million lives globally by March 2021 (NHS England,\u00a02021) whereas tocilizumab, a repurposed drug for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, is licensed for treating hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID\u201019 (Gordon et al.,\u00a02021; RECOVERY Collaborative Group,\u00a02021). The CORONA Project (a joint initiative by the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network and the Centre for Cytokine Storm Treatment & Laboratory) is tracking all other novel and repurposed drugs for COVID\u201019 and assigns the drugs a \u2018grade\u2019, based on treatment efficacy and whether pre\u2010specified endpoints are met (Venkatesan,\u00a02021).\nHere, we review the preclinical models that have demonstrated the pluripotential effects of niclosamide as well as some limited human data in a variety of disease states that suggest it could be an agent of choice in COVID\u201019.\n\n## HISTORY AND MECHANISM OF ACTION OF NICLOSAMIDE\nStructurally, niclosamide (Figure\u00a01) belongs to a large group of lipophilic, weakly acidic molecules called salicylanilides, a derivative of salicylic acid (Pearson & Hewlett,\u00a01985). Niclosamide is listed on the WHO's list of essential medications and chewable tablets have been approved for use as an anti\u2010helminthic agent for cestode (tapeworm) infections for over 40\u2009years with a daily oral dose of 2\u2009g niclosamide (Andrews et al.,\u00a01982). Niclosamide inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and stimulates ATP activity in the mitochondria of cestodes, killing both the scolex and the proximal segments of the tapeworm (Al\u2010Hadiya,\u00a02005; Weinbach & Garbus,\u00a01969). It has been shown to affect several signal transduction pathways such as Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor kappa\u2010light\u2010chain\u2010enhancer of activated B cells (nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB; NF\u2010\u03baB) and Notch pathways, all indicating its potential to treat conditions such as cancer (summarized in Table\u00a01), chronic medical diseases, and bacterial and viral infections.\nOral niclosamide is only partially absorbed from the intestinal tract with a low bioavailability of 5.5%\u201310% and is rapidly eliminated by the kidneys with no cumulative toxic effects (Andrews et al.,\u00a01982). Distribution studies in rodents with oral doses of 40\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u22121 niclosamide ethanolamine (i.e. ~34\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u22121 niclosamide) and 50\u00a0mg\u00b7kg\u22121 niclosamide demonstrate that tissue levels are highest in excretory organs (intestines, liver and kidney) and low to negligible levels are achieved in other tissues (such as the brain, heart and lungs) (Duhm et al.,\u00a01961; Tao et al.,\u00a02014).\n\n## Pharmacokinetics of oral niclosamide\nOral administration of niclosamide in rodents reached a mean maximum plasma concentration (C\nmax) of 22.4\u2009ng\u00b7ml\u22121 (1\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121), 354\u2009ng\u00b7ml\u22121 (5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121) and 644\u2009ng\u00b7ml\u22121 (~34\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121) (Chang et al.,\u00a02006; Choi et al.,\u00a02021; Tao et al.,\u00a02014). In humans receiving niclosamide (2\u2009g\u00b7day\u22121, p.o.), the median C\nmax ranged from 665 to 759\u2009ng\u00b7ml\u22121 in five colorectal cancer patients and from 250 to 6000\u2009ng\u00b7ml\u22121 in healthy subjects (Andrews et al.,\u00a01982; Burock, Daum, Keilholz, et al.,\u00a02018). In three prostate cancer patients receiving 1.5\u2009g\u00b7day\u22121, p.o., the C\nmax ranged from 35.7 to 182\u2009ng\u00b7ml\u22121, respectively (Schweizer et al.,\u00a02018a, 2018b).\nTherapeutic plasma levels in rodent studies (using doses from 5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121, p.o., to 200\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121, p.o.) likely exceed the plasma levels in humans prescribed a 2\u2009g p.o. dose, based on the results from Tao et al.\u00a0(2014) and assuming dose linearity. This therefore raises additional pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) challenges as well as potential toxicity issues for human clinical trials.\n\n## Niclosamide and metabolic syndrome\nA seminal study from Tao et al.\u00a0(2014) showed that niclosamide ethanolamine (150\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121, p.o.) reduced liver fat accumulation (steatosis) in mice fed a high\u2010fat diet. The effects were also studied in human liver cells and demonstrated increased lipid oxidation and up\u2010regulation of the AMP\u2010activated protein kinase pathway, suggesting its potential use as an anti\u2010obesity agent. In a murine obesity study, mice were fed either a chow or high\u2010fat diet and niclosamide (150\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121, p.o., or 75\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121, p.o.) and niclosamide ethanolamine for 10\u2009weeks (Chowdhury et al.,\u00a02017). Both niclosamide and niclosamide ethanolamine significantly improved glucose metabolism by inhibiting the glucagon signalling pathway, without altering total body weight or insulin secretion or sensitivity. In a further study, administration of niclosamide (140\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121, mixed in food) to high\u2010fat\u2010diet\u2010fed mice, resembling a murine obesity model, for 4\u2009weeks resulted in a significant decline in food intake and body weight compared with control mice (Al\u2010Gareeb et al.,\u00a02017). There was also significant lowering of the fasting blood glucose, fasting plasma insulin and improved insulin resistance.\n\n## Niclosamide and autoimmunity\nIn a collagen\u2010induced arthritis rat model, niclosamide (100\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121, p.o.) significantly reduced the arthritis index, footpad thickness and ankle swelling (Al\u2010Gareeb et al.,\u00a02019). Histopathological examination revealed reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells along with reduced bone and cartilage destruction. Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and IL\u20101\u03b2 were also significantly reduced compared with control animals. In a murine lupus study using MRL/lpr mice, daily administration of niclosamide (100\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121, oral gavage) for 7\u2009weeks improved proteinuria, anti\u2010dsDNA antibody levels, histological features and ameliorated C3 deposition in the kidneys (Jang et al.,\u00a02021). Niclosamide also led to a reduction of splenic follicular helper T cells and plasma cells STAT3 inhibition. Finally, in a hypochlorous acid\u2010induced mouse model of systemic sclerosis, niclosamide (10\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121 5\u2009days\u00b7week\u22121 for 6\u2009weeks, i.p.) reduced clinical markers of skin fibrosis, such as skin thickening and collagen content, as well as skin levels of IL\u20104 and IL\u201013. There was a decrease in STAT3, AKT and Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin pathways in the skin of hypochlorous acid\u2010induced mice (Morin et al.,\u00a02016). Finally, in an Iraqi study, patients with active rheumatoid arthritis on etanercept showed a good response to adjuvant niclosamide therapy (1\u2009g\u00b7day\u22121, p.o.). Significant improvements in joint and clinical severity indices and a decrease in the serum levels of IL\u20101\u03b2, E\u2010selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1) were observed (Al\u2010Gareeb et al.,\u00a02018).\n\n## Niclosamide and pulmonary pathology\nIn a screen of \u223c580,000 compounds, niclosamide was identified as a TMEM16A antagonist, a calcium\u2010activated chloride channel (CaCC) that contributes to mucus hypersecretion and bronchoconstriction in reactive airway disease (Miner et al.,\u00a02019). The study tested efficacy, using maximally contracted and cytokine\u2010treated airways,. and confirmed that niclosamide had a potent bronchodilator effect. In transgenic asthmatic mice, niclosamide (13\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 for 3\u2009days, i.p.) reduced mucus production and bronchoconstriction, and also demonstrated anti\u2010inflammatory and antibacterial effects (Cabrita et al.,\u00a02019). Centeio et al.\u00a0(2021) further investigated these findings, demonstrating that intratracheal instillation of 0.98% niclosamide for 4\u2009days inhibited mucus production and secretion in ovalbumin\u2010sensitized mice. Niclosamide has been found to exert anti\u2010fibrotic effects via Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signalling in a cellular model as well as in a bleomycin\u2010induced murine pulmonary fibrosis model, following once\u2010daily administration of low\u2010dose niclosamide (3\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121, i.p.) and high\u2010dose niclosamide (10\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121, i.p.) for 21\u2009days (Boyapally et al.,\u00a02019). In rats with established monocrotaline\u2010induced pulmonary hypertension, niclosamide (75\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 for 14\u2009days, p.o.) reduced vascular remodelling and improved right heart function via STAT3 inhibition (Braga et al.,\u00a02020). There was reduced expression of TGF\u2010\u03b2, hypoxia\u2010inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF) and vimentin, a mesenchymal marker, along with reduced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).\n\n## Niclosamide and cancer\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that niclosamide has potent in vitro and in vivo effects against a wide range of cancers. We have further summarized animal and preclinical studies that highlight the potential use of niclosamide in cancer in Table\u00a01. In a Phase 1 dose\u2010escalation study testing oral niclosamide plus standard dose enzalutamide for prostate cancer conducted by Schweizer et al.\u00a0(2018a, 2018b), subjects on the higher dose (1000\u2009mg three times per day, p.o.) experienced dose\u2010limiting toxicities including vomiting, diarrhoea and colitis. Plasma concentrations at this maximum dose were below the therapeutic threshold and therefore, the study was closed due to ineffectiveness. A further, more recent Phase Ib trial identified the maximum tolerated dose of a novel reformulated version of niclosamide and recommended a Phase 2 study of this orally bioavailable form in combination with abiraterone and prednisolone in men with castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer (Parikh et al.,\u00a02021). Nine patients were recruited and no dose\u2010limiting toxicity was observed at any dose. Five out of eight patients achieved a prostate\u2010specific antigen response, two achieved undetectable prostate\u2010specific antigen levels and a radiographic response. The NIKOLO clinical trial is a Phase II, single\u2010centre, one\u2010arm open\u2010label study to investigate the safety and efficacy of niclosamide in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer progressing under standard therapy (Burock, Daum, Keilholz, et al.,\u00a02018; Burock, Daum, Tr\u00f6ger, et al.,\u00a02018). The study is focused on the feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of niclosamide in order to explore new treatment options. It is worth noting that despite ongoing trials, niclosamide is not approved for the treatment of any oncological condition.\n\n## Niclosamide and other models of disease\nIn a murine endometriosis model, established by surgically inducing endometriotic\u2010like lesions, niclosamide (100 and 200\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121, p.o.) decreased the growth rate and progression of endometriosis\u2010like lesions and inhibited STAT3 and NF\u2010\u03baB pathways (Prather et al.,\u00a02016). Inhibition of macrophage\u2010induced inflammatory pathways has been observed in primary endometriotic stromal cells (Sekulovski et al.,\u00a02020). Niclosamide has also been shown to act as a potential neuroprotective agent such as in Parkinson's disease by activating PINK1 in HeLA and primary cortical neurons (Barini et al.,\u00a02018), reduce neuro\u2010inflammation in activated murine primary microglia in vitro (Serrano et al.,\u00a02019) and block signalling pathways associated with neuropathic pain in rats receiving 1\u2009mM niclosamide intratracheally (Zhang et al.,\u00a02013).\n\n## NICLOSAMIDE AS AN ANTIBACTERIAL AGENT\nNiclosamide has well\u2010identified antimicrobial properties and has been shown to prevent the formation of biofilms of hospital\u2010acquired and device\u2010associated gram\u2010positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin\u2010resistant S.\u00a0aureus (MRSA) at concentrations as low as 0.01\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7ml\u22121 (Gwisai et al.,\u00a02017). When applied as a device coating, niclosamide prevented bacterial attachment and demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity (Gwisai et al.,\u00a02017). In a screen of 1280 commercially available drugs, niclosamide was one of nine agents that possessed antimicrobial activity against preformed biofilms (Torres et al.,\u00a02016). A time\u2010kill study further showed that niclosamide is bacteriostatic against a number of gram\u2010positive bacteria including MRSA, displaying strong in vivo (Caenorhabditis elegans\u2010MRSA liquid infection model) as well as in vitro activity (Rajamuthiah et al.,\u00a02015). Niclosamide had activities against clinical isolates of vancomycin\u2010resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and was superior to linezolid as a gastrointestinal decolonizing agent of vancomycin\u2010resistant Enterococcus faecium\u2010challenged mice (Mohammad et al.,\u00a02018). In this vancomycin\u2010resistant Enterococcus faecium\u2010colonization\u2010reduction mouse model, niclosamide (10\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 for 8\u2009days, oral gavage) was administered to mice that were sensitized with ampicillin followed by E.\u00a0faecium infection to establish gastrointestinal colonization. Tam et al.\u00a0(2018) showed that niclosamide inhibited the pathogenesis of multidrug\u2010resistant Clostridium difficile by targeting entry of its toxins into colonocytes. In a mouse model of primary and recurrent C.\u00a0difficile infection, post\u2010infection treatment with niclosamide (50\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 for 4\u2009days, p.o.) ethanolamine (5% in DMSO) reduced both the primary disease and recurrence, without disrupting the gut microbiota (Tam et al.,\u00a02018). Niclosamide is stable in acidic pH and synergizes with metronidazole and proton pump inhibitors to eliminate Helicobacter pylori adhesion/invasion via multiple mechanisms such as reducing trans\u2010membrane pH, inhibiting IL\u20108 (CXCL8) secretion and disrupting H.\u00a0pylori proton motility (Tharmalingam et al.,\u00a02018). A screen of FDA\u2010approved drugs identified niclosamide as an inhibitor of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing signalling molecules (Imperi et al.,\u00a02013). Finally, niclosamide has significant activity against multidrug\u2010resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains (Sun & Zhang,\u00a01999) and inhibited its growth in infected human macrophages in a bacteriostatic manner (Fan et al.,\u00a02019). The same study also showed that it inhibited HIV replication in human macrophages via transcriptional effects.\n\n## NICLOSAMIDE AS AN ANTIVIRAL AGENT\nNiclosamide role in anti\u2010viral host defence was first reported by Jurgeit et al.\u00a0(2010) by the use of a monoclonal antibody against viral dsRNA during image\u2010based screening of infected cells. Niclosamide was shown to neutralize acidic membrane bound compartments via a proton carrier mode of action (protonophore) in vesicles as well as in protein\u2010free liposomes (Jurgeit et al.,\u00a02012). Blockade of the acidification of the endolysosomal compartments, without affecting vacuolar ATPase, has been shown to inhibit infection with the human rhinovirus and influenza virus in a pH\u2010dependent manner. The same mechanism was shown to mediate its antiviral efficacy against both Dengue and Zika viruses (Jung et al.,\u00a02019). A study found that niclosamide antiviral activity against Dengue virus was through a reduction of endosomal acidification and phosphorylation of AKT and p70SK (independent of mTOR) and against Zika virus through endosomal acidification and blocking the NS2B\u2013NS3 interaction, thus highlighting its pleotropic antiviral effects (Kao et al.,\u00a02018; Z. Li et al.,\u00a02017). In a murine model of Dengue\u2010virus infection (suckling mice injected intracranially and i.p. with Dengue virus), treatment with niclosamide (5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121, i.p.) resulted in a significant reduction of viral replication in the brain and decreased mortality. However, exposure of niclosamide in the target tissues was not determined (Kao et al.,\u00a02018). Similarly, systemic administration of 1% niclosamide solution (50\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121) to a humanized Zika\u2010virus infection model (embryonic chicks developing microcephaly) significantly reduced viral replication and restored cranial width and height (Cairns et al.,\u00a02018). Using a high\u2010throughput screening system and a subsequent entry assay, Wang et al.\u00a0(2016) identified niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus entry, viral release and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission against Chikungunya virus and two other alphaviruses, Sindbis virus and Semliki forest virus. Li et al.\u00a0(2017) found that niclosamide is a broad\u2010spectrum inhibitor against flaviviruses and also inhibited the replication of Ebola and Chikungunya viruses via the modulation of low pH\u2010dependent cellular mechanisms of viral maturation (Madrid et al.,\u00a02015; Mazzon et al.,\u00a02019). A systematic screen of FDA\u2010approved drugs identified niclosamide as one of the most potent Ebola virus inhibitors, although its in vivo efficacy is yet to be confirmed in animal models (Madrid et al.,\u00a02015). Finally, niclosamide also inhibits the pathogenic Beta\u2010CoVs (Gassen et al.,\u00a02019; Wen et al.,\u00a02007; Wu et al.,\u00a02004; Yang et al.,\u00a02020) and reduced the replication of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (MERS\u2010Co\u2010V) via a mechanism involving enhanced autophagy through inhibition of S\u2010phase kinase\u2010associated protein 2 (SKP2) (Gassen et al.,\u00a02019).\n\n## NICLOSAMIDE AS A POTENT \nGiven niclosamide potent antiviral activity within the beta\u2010CoV family, it became apparent that it could be a potent antiviral against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. A study by Jeon et al.\u00a0(2020) testing 3000 FDA\u2010approved drugs and other well\u2010characterized molecules identified niclosamide as the most potent inhibitor of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in Vero cells, with a 40\u2010fold higher potency than remdesivir. Furthermore, Weiss et al.\u00a0(2021) showed that niclosamide potency is conserved against the Alpha, Beta and Delta SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variant in Vero transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) cells and validated niclosamide strong antiviral activity in a human airway epithelial model. Niclosamide has also been shown to inhibit SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 in vivo. Specifically, an inhaled niclosamide formulation was developed and tested in a murine infection model of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Brunaugh et al.,\u00a02021). Administration of niclosamide (0.24\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121, intranasal) to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected mice for 10\u2009days improved survival and significantly reduced viral loads. Niclosamide further exhibited potent properties as an anti\u2010MRSA bacteriostatic agent and modulated various inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106 and TNF\u2010\u03b1. These findings suggest that niclosamide could also address secondary bacterial infections, which is one of the leading causes of death in COVID\u201019 patients. It is evident that local administration in these viral infection models allowed substantially lower doses (0.25 and 5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121) compared with oral doses, thereby increasing the therapeutic window in terms of safety issues arising from excessive systemic exposure from oral dosing.\n\n## Mechanism of action against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\nThe antiviral activity of niclosamide against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is complex and involves multiple cellular processes as illustrated in Figure\u00a02. SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 uses the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular entry receptor in permissive cells of the respiratory tract and the spike proteins initiate the merging of the viral envelope with the host cell cytomembrane (Zhou et al.,\u00a02020). Following receptor binding and conformational changes in the spike protein, cathepsin L mediates proteolysis within endosomes leading to viral entry into host cells, as it has been shown for SARS\u2010CoV (Gomes et al.,\u00a02020; Huang et al.,\u00a02006; Simmons et al.,\u00a02005). The protonophoric activity of niclosamide that causes endosomal neutralization is thought to interfere with viral entry and egress preventing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 genome release and maturation. This mechanism has been derived from studies with pH\u2010dependent respiratory viruses\u2014rhinovirus and influenza virus\u2014which also use pH\u2010sensitive mechanisms of the endosomal pathway for viral entry and egress, similar to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Jurgeit et al.,\u00a02012). Garrett et al.\u00a0(2021) recently demonstrated that the total lipid profile is amplified during SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection in VeroE6 cells and treatment with niclosamide led to a reduction in lipids available for virus production. Additionally, in primary human lung cells and intestinal organoids, niclosamide enhances autophagy through inhibition of S\u2010phase kinase\u2010associated protein 2 thus further attenuating SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 replication (Gassen et al.,\u00a02021).\nSyncytia formation in SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010infected pneumocytes has been observed in COVID\u201019 lungs. To identify inhibitors of spike\u2010driven syncytia formation, a high\u2010content microscopy\u2010based screening of more than 3000 compounds was conducted (L. Braga et al.,\u00a02021). The screen identified efficacious drugs that inhibited viral replication, with one of the most potent being niclosamide. Niclosamide also has potent bronchodilatory effects, inhibits excessive mucus production and down\u2010regulates the release of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20108 by inhibiting TMEM16A (Cabrita et al.,\u00a02019). Due to its effects on intracellular calcium levels, niclosamide can inhibit other cytokines and could therefore play an important role in controlling the cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in acutely ill COVID\u201019 patients.\nThe above studies show several plausible mechanisms of action of niclosamide against COVID\u201019, including prevention of viral entry, prevention of viral replication via autophagy inhibition and, finally, inhibition of spike\u2010driven syncytia formation. Importantly, unlike vaccines or monoclonal antibodies, the host\u2010directed mechanism of action of niclosamide means its antiviral efficacy is less likely to be affected by the emergence of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 variants, as has been shown for the Alpha, Beta and Delta variant by Weiss et al.\u00a0(2021). In conclusion, these studies have confirmed potent, multi\u2010faceted and pleiotropic activity of niclosamide against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, targeting multiple aspects of the viral life cycle.\n\n## CLINICAL TRIALS OF NICLOSAMIDE FOR COVID\u201019\nBased on promising preclinical data, niclosamide is currently being evaluated as a potential COVID\u201019 treatment in 18 human clinical trials relying on different formulations and/or routes of administration. Details of these trials can be found on public registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO's Trial search website. Twelve of these trials are in Phase 2/3 and investigate the efficacy of niclosamide across the full COVID\u201019 disease spectrum (Figure\u00a03 and Table\u00a02).\nIn the pre\u2010symptomatic and mild COVID\u201019 disease stage, the potent antiviral activity of niclosamide is thought to limit disease symptomatology and progression. However, as COVID\u201019 progresses towards moderate and severe disease, the bronchodilatory and anti\u2010inflammatory effects of niclosamide might contribute to efficacy. Its antibacterial efficacy could also benefit COVID\u201019 patients at risk for secondary bacterial infections, which is one of the leading causes of mortality in COVID\u201019 (Cevik et al.,\u00a02020), particularly since the introduction of immunomodulators such as dexamethasone and tocilizumab as standard of care (SoC) medications.\n\n## Oral formulations\nOf the 14 Phase 2/3 trials (Table\u00a02), 11 trials are investigating oral formulations of niclosamide with seven using the marketed oral tablet form of niclosamide (also known under the tradename Yomesan), one utilizing capsules and one a novel suspension. However, one of these is registered as terminated due to subtherapeutic plasma levels and another one was withdrawn due to evidence showing the non\u2010effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, which was being tested in one of the study arms.\nNiclosamide in a chewable tablet form is being investigated in moderate COVID\u201019 patients with gastrointestinal signs and symptoms at a dose of 400\u2009mg three times per day for 14\u2009days (National ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT) number 04542434, NCT04858425). Mortality, adverse event rate, faecal virus clearance and several clinical features are listed as outcome measures. Niclosamide in a chewable tablet form is also being investigated (in addition to standard of care(SoC) in asymptomatic/mild outpatient cases at 500\u2009mg two times per day for 7\u201314\u2009days (Clinical Trials Registry \u2013 India (CTRI)/2020/04/024949), mild\u2013moderate cases at 2\u2009g four times per day for 7\u2009days (NCT04399356), moderate COVID\u201019 subjects at 2\u2009g\u00b7day\u22121 for 7\u2009days (Clinical Trials Registry \u2013 India/2021/05/033791), moderately ill hospitalized COVID\u201019 cases with gastrointestinal symptoms (NCT04436458) and mild\u2013severe patients receiving a 2\u2009g loading dose\u2009+\u20091\u2009g every 12\u2009h on Day 1 and then 1\u2009g three times per",
