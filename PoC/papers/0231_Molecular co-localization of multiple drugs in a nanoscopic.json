  "abstract": "Anti-microbial resistant infection is predicted to be alarming in upcoming years. In the present study, we proposed co-localization of two model drugs viz., rifampicin and benzothiazole used in anti-tuberculosis and anti-fungal agents respectively in a nanoscopic cationic micelle (cetyl triethyl ammonium bromide) with hydrodynamic diameter of 2.69\u00a0nm. Sterilization effect of the co-localized micellar formulation against a model multi-drug resistant bacterial strain viz., Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was also investigated. 99.88% decrease of bacterial growth in terms of colony forming unit was observed using the developed formulation. While Dynamic Light Scattering and Forsters Resonance Energy Transfer between benzothiazole and rifampicin show co-localization of the drugs in the nanoscopic micellar environment, analysis of time-resolved fluorescence decays by Infelta-Tachiya model and the probability distribution of the donor-acceptor distance fluctuations for 5\u00a0\u03bcM,10\u00a0\u03bcM and 15\u00a0\u03bcM acceptor concentrations confirm efficacy of the co-localization. Energy transfer efficiency and the donor acceptor distance are found to be 46% and 20.9\u00a0\u00c5 respectively. We have also used a detailed computational biology framework to rationalize the sterilization effect of our indigenous formulation. It has to be noted that the drugs used in our studies are not being used for their conventional indication. Rather the co-localization of the drugs in the micellar environment shows a completely different indication of their use in the remediation of multi-drug resistant bacteria revealing the re-purposing of the drugs for potential use in hospital-born multi-drug resistant bacterial infection.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) has declared antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections as one of the top 10 global public health threats1. It was reported that in 2019 alone, the AMR organisms were the primary cause of 1.27 million deaths worldwide2. If corrective mechanisms are not put into place, it is likely to skyrocket. In an alarming report, commissioned by the UK government, it was predicted that antimicrobial resistance may cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 20503. Amongst antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria species is of great concern, primarily because of their ability to mutate genes and to reduce drug action. Poor drug binding capacity and low cell penetration4 make multidrug-resistant bacteria responsible for almost 65% infections which are linked with HealthCare-Associated disease5. The inappropriate use of antibiotics is responsible for rise in bacterial resistance, which makes the clinical management of infections hard to manage with conventional antibiotics6. Numerous bacteria, especially MDR, can grow and survive on the contaminated damp surfaces7, for a longer time, mainly in healthcare facility. The dirt and organic element from human or animal origin can work as substrates for the growth of the bacteria and facilitates the spread of micro-organism induced infection from individual to the community. Hence, the rapid and effective disinfection of surfaces and environmental cleanliness is one of the primary measures to control the spread of MDR bacteria. Amongst all multidrug-resistant bacteria, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been categorized as a high priority multidrug-resistant pathogen by WHO8. It can cause a mild skin infections to fatal infections6. MRSA is resistant to penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin and amoxicillin9. MRSA, being one of the most critical human organism and colonizing bacteria, is responsible for one of the leading causes of infections worldwide10. Infections induced by MRSA carry significant clinical load for the patient and medical practitioner11. Prolonged hospital stay, increased hospital cost as well as higher hospital mortality12 also impart a huge economic burden to the patient-family, healthcare systems and to the society13,14.\nEmerging MDR strains of MRSA are clinically notorious because of their lack of response to conventional antimicrobial therapy. It is known that biofilm formation is one of the main causes behind antibiotic resistance. Biofilm, an organized colony of microorganisms, forms an extracellular polymeric matrix of substance and shows adhesion with the neighbouring living and non-living surfaces15. It facilitates microorganism interaction and protect tolerant cells from the change in living environment for a long period of time16. The biofilm matrix strengthen the tolerance to disinfectants by wrapping the underlying cells17,18 and by restricting diffusion of disinfectants into the biofilm matrix19. Hence, regulating biofilm formation has become an alternative approach to limit persistent infections20. Regular use of disinfectants on potential-contaminated surfaces have become an important routine practice for sterilization21,22 as it reduces biofilm formation and reduces transmission of infectious pathogens, in turn. Currently, bleach (sodium hypochlorite)\u2014derivative solutions are used in healthcare facilities23 as disinfectant spray. Although, it has significant adverse effect on bacterial contaminants, due to its oxidizing capacity and toxicity, the bleach-derivative products are not suitable for long-term use24. Despite the presence of significant environmental threat, chlorine (Cl2) and its derivative sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) are still the most widely used disinfectants. Organic chloride compounds released by these chloride-based sterilising agents in the wastewater are toxic for aquatic organisms and possess a significant threat as environmental contaminants25. Hence, new avenues are required to be examined to control the huge adverse impact of the MRSA infections26.\nPreviously it was pointed out that the combination of two different drugs linked through a selectively chosen drug carrier, improves the efficacy of the system against AMR activities27,28. The present study explores the co-localization of an antituberculosis drug rifampicin (RF) with another drug benzothiazole (BT) in an organized assembly of Cetyl Triethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) micelles, and their prospect as an antibacterial spray against MRSA. RF is a popular drug with a proven safety profile for treatment of tuberculosis for its sterilizing activity and ability to shorten treatment29,30. BT is an important class of medicine possessing antibacterial31, antiviral32, anticancer33, antifungal34 and antitumor35 properties. On the other hand, CTAB solution which works as a nanoscopic vehicle by bringing BT and RF together, too is safe and familiar for their antimicrobial properties36. In this context it is worth mentioning that some studies already investigated the development and design of novel drug delivery systems using density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations37,38.\nFor our study, to obtain precise location of the drugs RF and BT in the organized assembly of CTAB, FRET between BT (energy donor) and RF (energy acceptor) was employed because the fluorescence spectrum of BT overlaps reasonably well with the absorption spectrum of RF. Time-resolved studies on FRET39\u201341 were employed to obtain precise information on localization of the drugs (RF and BT) in CTAB micelles. In addition, dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique was used to investigate the integrity of the nanoscopic organized assembly of CTAB micelles. Furthermore, we have applied a kinetic model developed by Tachiya to analyze the fluorescence decay of BT in presence of RF in CTAB micelles42,43 and compared them with the experimental data. These findings are finally extended to MRSA bacteria and the promising potential of the RF-BT encapsulated in CTAB micelles as a strong antibacterial spraying agent has been established. It was observed that separately these compounds, i.e., RF, BT and CTAB show low to moderate level effectivity against the MRSA colonies. Whereas their combined effect has shown impressive results by successfully eliminating almost all the colonies of MRSA. Singular and doublet combinations of these chemicals were also studied to comprehensively explore sterilising possibilities. Computational biology study on the formulation shows that the drugs rifampicin and benzothiazole, although conventionally used as tuberculosis and antifungal agents, can be repurposed for remediation of the MDR micro-bacteria including MRSA.\n\n## Chemicals\n2-(2-Hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (BT), rifampicin (RF), Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), Ethanol, acetonitrile (ACN), Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, California. All the chemicals were used as purchased without any further purification. Luria broth (LB) and LB top agar medium for bacterial studies were bought from HIMEDIA.\n\n## Sample preparation\n50\u00a0mM, 3\u00a0mM and 4\u00a0mM stock solutions of CTAB in DI water (Milli-Q), RF in ethanol and BT in acetonitrile were prepared. The solutions were diluted according to the experimental study.\n\n## Photophysical studies\nDynamic Light Scattering (DLS) measurements were performed in a Nano S Malvern (Zeta-seizer) instrument employing a He\u2013Ne laser source (wavelength\u2009=\u2009632.8\u00a0nm) of 4 mW power and equipped with a thermostatic sample chamber. All the scattered photons were collected at 173\u00b0 scattering angle. The scattering intensity data were processed using the embedded instrumental software to obtain the hydrodynamic diameter (dH) and particle size distribution of the scatterer in each sample. The instrument measures the time-dependent fluctuation in the intensity of light scattered from the particles in solution at a fixed scattering angle. The intensity autocorrelation function of the time-dependent fluctuation in scattered intensity gives estimation of the hydrodynamic diameter (dH) of the clusters. Hydrodynamic diameter dH is defined by1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${d}_{H}=\\frac{{k}_{b}T}{3\\pi \\eta D}$$\\end{document}dH=kbT3\u03c0\u03b7D\nwhere, kb is the Boltzmann constant, \u03b7 is the viscosity of solvent (here, 50\u00a0mM CTAB), T is the absolute temperature, and D is the translational diffusion coefficient. The resolution of the measuring instrument in this study is 0.65\u00a0nm.\n\n## Steady state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy\nSteady state absorption and emission spectra were measured with Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer and Jobin Yvon Fluorolog fluorimeter, respectively. All the picosecond resolved fluorescence transients were measured by using commercially available time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) setup with MCP-PMT from Edinburgh instrument, UK (instrument response function (IRF) of\u2009~\u200975\u00a0ps) using a 375\u00a0nm excitation laser source. All the fluorescence transients have been measured in magic angle. In our study, benzothiazole and rifampicin act as the donor and acceptor respectively. The non-emissive behaviour of the RF eliminates the possibility of the interference of RF in BT fluorescence transients in CTAB micelle. Details of the time resolved fluorescence setup have been discussed in our previous reports44,45.\n\n## Fitting of picosecond resolved fluorescence transients\nThe observed fluorescence transients were fitted by using a nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure to a function2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$(X\\left(t\\right)=\\underset{0}{\\overset{t}{\\int }}E(t{^{\\prime}})R(t-{t}^{^{\\prime}})dt{^{\\prime}})$$\\end{document}(Xt=\u222bt0E(t\u2032)R(t-t\u2032)dt\u2032)\n(E(t)) with a sum of exponentials (2) with pre-exponential factors (Bi),3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$(R\\left(t\\right)=A+\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{B}_{i}{e}^{-t/{\\tau }_{i}}$$\\end{document}(Rt=A+\u2211i=1NBie-t/\u03c4i\nWith characteristic lifetimes (\u03c4i) and a background (A).

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain (ATCC 25923) was procured from ATCC. For antibacterial assay, fresh MRSA bacteria have been cultured using Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium in a shaker incubator at a temperature of 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The freshly grown MRSA culture was further diluted 106 times and samples were added. The treatment of bacteria was performed on LB agar plates by the colony-forming unit (CFU) assays method under dark condition. The cells were incubated with 1\u00a0mM of CTAB, RF (80\u00a0\u00b5M), BT (80\u00a0\u00b5M), RF-BT in 1\u00a0mM CTAB (The concentration of BT and RF is 80\u00a0\u00b5M), RF (80\u00a0\u00b5M) in 1\u00a0mM of CTAB and BT (80\u00a0\u00b5M) in 1\u00a0mM of CTAB separately for 3\u00a0h without any photo-activation. Then the cultures were uniformly spread on LB agar plates and the plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h to get the CFUs. To quantify the antibacterial activity, the CFU numbers were manually counted and presented as a bar diagram.\n\n## Statistics\nData are represented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation unless otherwise stated. Unpaired 2-tailed T-Test was used to calculate differences between groups. P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant. For all statistical tests, GraphPad Prism (v8.0) software was used.\n\n## Computational tools used to study compound-protein interaction\nTo predict Chemical-Protein (CP) Interaction Networks of the drugs on MRSA, the web-resource STITCH (version 5.0) provided by STITCH Consortium2016 (http://stitch.embl.de/) was used. STITCH database can predict about 430,000 chemicals and 960,0000 proteins curated from 2031 eukaryotic and prokaryotic genome48,49. The association for a chemical-protein interaction can be predicted by the confidence score, where higher score corresponds to a stronger interaction. Medium confidence score (0.4) was used for the present study. Eight different sources, i.e. experiments, text mining, neighborhood, gene fusion, databases, co-expression, co-occurrence and predictions are used to populate the active interactions.\n\n## Results and discussions\nThe drug rifampicin is reported to be hydrophobic50\u201352, as it is less soluble in aqueous solution. However, in aqueous medium (pH\u2009=\u20097) RF can be amphiphilic or amphoteric53,54 considering its charge distribution. Thus. RF is expected to interact superficially with the cationic CTAB micelle or bind to the outer surface of CTAB micelle which is also amphiphilic55. Considering that RF at pH 7 remains in the Zwitterionic form53, it can interact electrostatically with the head group of the CTAB micelle and is therefore most likely to stay in the micelle\u2013water interface50 as portrayed in Fig.\u00a01a and b. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies (Fig.\u00a01d) indicate that the CTAB micelles form mono-dispersed spheres, in aqueous buffer, of hydrodynamic diameter (dH) of 2.69\u00a0nm. After addition of the energy donor (BT) and the energy acceptor (RF) in 50\u00a0mM micellar solution, the hydrodynamic diameter peaks were observed to remain almost in the same position confirming our conjecture of binding of RF (Fig.\u00a01c) inside the periphery of the cationic micelle. Except Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), another technique is the HRTEM (High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy) by which one can characterize the monodispersity of the micellar solution. Bahadur et. al. has already performed cryo-TEM at\u2009~\u2009150\u00a0mM CTAB micellar solution and found it to be completely monodispersed which further discard the possibility of micellar aggregation in our study56,57. Another proof of the monodispersity is the UV\u2013visible absorption of the drug loaded micelle where the existence of the aggregation can be ruled out by the higher absorption value of the drug at the absorption tail. Furthermore, our prepared micellar solution is completely transparent which further supports the monodispersity of the micellar solution at the particular concentration used in our study. The angstrom (\u212b) sized drugs should not bring any effect on the micellar size after encapsulation. The hydrodynamic diameter is calculated automatically by the instrument from the fitting parameter of the autocorrelation function. It is an average phenomenon and accuracy depends on the number of runs performed by an experimentalist during the experiment. Standard deviation of the Malvern DLS instrument in terms of hydrodynamic diameter lies within the range of\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u00a0nm. In our study, the size reduction obtained as\u2009~\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u00a0nm as shown in Fig.\u00a01d, and to the best of our understanding it is inconclusive as it lies within fluctuation range of the measurement.Figure 1(a) Front view of CTAB micelle. (b) Side view of CTAB micelle. (c) Structure of rifampicin molecule. (d) Scattering Intensity of 50\u00a0mM CTAB micelle, BT added to CTAB and BT and RF added together to CTAB as obtained from the dynamic light scattering study.\n\n## Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)\nFRET is an energy transfer process between a pair of fluorophores, where the donor fluorophore, initially in its electronic excited state, transfers energy to an acceptor fluorophore40,58. In our study, RF, a well-known anti tuberculosis drug, is chosen as an acceptor for studying FRET in CTAB because of two reasons. Firstly, RF, being a neutral dye, localizes in the interfacial region of the micellar headgroup and hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains59. Secondly, the fluorescence spectra of BT as donor overlaps excellently (Fig.\u00a03a) with the absorption spectra of RF (Fig.\u00a02a). The drugs RF and BT were thus chosen due to their efficacy of forming FRET-pair. In order to study the co-localization of the two model drugs, FRET is found to be very efficient tool as indicated in our study. Figures\u00a02b and 3b show significant decrease in fluorescence intensity of BT in 50\u00a0mM CTAB solution upon addition of increasing amount of RF indicating to an efficient energy transfer from BT to RF. Time-resolved fluorescence decay of BT becomes distinctly faster (Fig.\u00a03c) in presence of RF consistent with significant quenching of the fluorescence transients of BT in CTAB micelle. The average fluorescence lifetime of BT decreases remarkably (Table 1) from 2.56 to 1.37\u00a0ns in presence of 10\u00a0\u03bcM of RF in 50\u00a0mM CTAB micelle confirming an efficient energy transfer from BT to RF which is consistent with a donor acceptor distance of 20.9\u00a0\u00c5 (Table 2). This highly efficient (E\u2009=\u200946%, Table 2) energy transfer from BT to RF is consistent with co-localization of both the drugs within the CTAB micelle.Figure 2(a) Absorbance spectra of Rifampicin (RF) in 50\u00a0mM CTAB micelles for concentrations 0\u201360.56\u00a0\u00b5M.

The distribution function becomes broader at higher acceptor concentration relative to that of the lower concentration, which corresponds to the higher average amplitude in fluctuation of the donor\u2013acceptor distance during energy transfer process for the former than the later. This is further reflected in increasing value (Table 2 and Fig.\u00a04) of the \u2018hw\u2019 parameter (full width at half maxima) of the P(r) upon increasing concentrations of the acceptor concentrations (RF). The increase in the amplitude of the donor/acceptor distance fluctuation is consistent with the progressive increase of the FRET efficiency and decrease in the donor/acceptor distance. Thus, the CTAB micelle turns out to be an efficient nanoscopic vehicle for co-encapsulation of both BT and RF, giving rise to a formulation with better antimicrobial activity than that based on only BT or RF.Figure 4Probability distribution of donor\u2009\u2212\u2009acceptor distances between Rifampicin and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzothiazole in CTAB micelles for different concentrations of acceptor (a) 5\u00a0\u03bcM, (b) 10\u00a0\u03bcM, (c) 15\u00a0\u03bcM.\n\n## Infelta-Tachiya model for the quantitative estimation of the donor/acceptor distribution in the micellar cavity\nFor better assessment of the association between RF and BT in CTAB micelle, it is important to estimate the distribution of RF molecules, because, the energy transfer efficiency solely depends on the availability of the acceptor molecules in the vicinity of the donor molecules.
