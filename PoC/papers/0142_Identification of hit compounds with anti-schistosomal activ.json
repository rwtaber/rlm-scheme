  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anthelminthic treatment options against schistosomiasis are limited. The current treatment relies almost exclusively on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). As a consequence, the development of resistance to PZQ and limited activity of PZQ against earlier development stages are respectively a risk and a limitation to achieving the goals of the new WHO roadmap towards elimination. For the discovery of new chemical starting points, the in vitro drug screening on Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) against newly transformed schistosomula (NTS) is still the most predominant approach. The use of only NTS in the initial screening limits sensitivity to potential new compounds which are predominantly active in later developmental stages. Using our recently described highly standardized, straightforward and reliable culture method that generates high rates of juvenile worms, we aimed to repurpose a subset of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Pharmaceutical Collection (340 compounds) to identify new hits with an in vitro worm culture assay. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cercariae were mechanically transformed into skin-stage (SkS) schistosomula and continuously cultured for 3-6 weeks to the liver stage (LiS). A commercial source of serum was identified, and decrease of NTS/well along with optimal drug testing conditions was established to test compounds on early and late LiS worms. The library was screened in 96-well format assays using praziquantel (PZQ) as a positive control. Primary screening allowed a 5.9% hit rate and generated two confirmed hits on adult worms; a prophylactic antianginal agent and an antihistaminic drug. CONCLUSION: With this standardized and reliable in vitro assay, important S. mansoni developmental stages up to LiS worms can be generated and cultured over an extended period. When exposed to a subset of the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection, 3 compounds yielded a defined anti-schistosomal phenotype on juvenile worms. Translation of activity on perfused adult S. mansoni worms was achieved only for perhexiline (a prophylactic antianginal agent) and astemizole (an antihistaminic drug).",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nSchistosomiasis or bilharzia is caused by infection with trematodes of the genus Schistosoma and leads to chronic and debilitating disease [1]. Schistosomiasis is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases (NTD) with over 200,000 deaths each year due to the consequences of the disease [2]. According to WHO, in 2018, it was estimated that at least 290.8 million people required preventive treatment for schistosomiasis, with more than 97.2 million people receiving treatment [2]. Therefore, it is important to globally eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem over the next decade [3,4]. Implementation of several strategies, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) [5,6], mass drug administrations (MDAs), veterinary public health, vector control, and intensified case management are all critical in reducing the disease burden [3]. The MDA heads national control programs through the application of the only presently available drug, praziquantel (PZQ) with low treatment cost per individual [7,8]. While intensifying on the coverage with PZQ and therefore the drug pressure, concerns about emerging resistance should be taken into account and not taken lightly. Presence of PZQ resistance has already been recorded in experimental models [9]. The first cases of decreased drug efficacy have been observed in the laboratory-adapted isolate of S. mansoni [10] and in the field [7,11,12].\nAs a consequence, new drugs and alternative strategies, such as the use of vaccines, are of utmost importance to support the elimination of schistosomiasis. To support the discovery of alternatives to PZQ, in vitro assays of developmental stages and adult worms are crucial for decreasing dependence on in vivo or ex vivo experiments in line with the 3Rs (replacement, reduction, and refinement) of animal testing [13]. Thus, a robust, reliable and standardized way to generate advanced larval stages of S. mansoni provides an opportunity to incorporate initial advanced-stage schistosomula testing into the current drug screening cascade to meet the desired target candidate profiles (TCP), e.g. activity against juvenile stages of the schistosomes to confer chemoprevention potential.\nWe have recently described a novel cell-free method [14] to culture juvenile worms in a robust manner and now report improvements in the methods along with the screening of a small library of approved drugs as a usability and repurposing exercise.\n\n## Ethics statement\nAll animal protocols were approved and performed in accordance with the local government authorities of Bezirksregierung von Oberbayern (license no. AZ. 55.2.1.54-2532-145-17). Our animal care and use protocol are in accordance with national and European Union guidelines 2010/63.\n\n## NCATS library\nThe library was a subset of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Pharmaceutical Collection of approved and investigational drugs [15]. This subset was comprised of 340 drugs approved for human use in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia, excluding cancer drugs. The compounds were dispensed in a 384-well plate, 30 \u03bcL at 1\u201320 mM concentration in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution.\n\n## NTS generation\nCercariae of imported NMRI strain of S. mansoni or in-house Brazilian strain were collected from infected Biomphalaria glabrata snails. Biomphalaria glabrata snails infected with the NMRI strain were provided by the NIAID Schistosomiasis Resource Center of the Biomedical Research Institute (Rockville, MD) through NIH-NIAID Contract HHSN272201700014I for distribution through BEI Resources. Screening of NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection of approved and investigational drugs and subsequent confirmation of hits was primarily performed on the NMRI strain. After collection, cercariae were mechanically transformed into NTS as described in [14]. Briefly, cercariae were incubated 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 1962 RCF for 3 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet containing cercariae was resuspended in Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Cat. No. H6648, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Cat. No. P4333, Sigma-Aldrich). The mechanical transformation was performed through pipetting and vortexing to separate the cercarial head from tails. Tails and cercarial bodies were removed by washing three times in ice-cold HBSS supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. After the third wash, the supernatant was removed carefully, leaving the pellet containing NTS. The pellet was resuspended in culture medium containing HybridoMed Diff 1000 (HM) (Cat. No. F 8055/1, Biochrom GmbH, Germany) supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin, 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20% human serum. The NTS were counted, concentration adjusted, and ~50 or ~100 NTS in 150 \u03bcL were incubated in culture medium supplemented with 20% human serum at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for transformation to be completed.\n\n## NTS culture\nNTS (~50 or ~100 NTS in 150 \u03bcL) were grown in commercially available cell culture media HM) supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin, and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. NTS were cultured in a 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate (Falcon, Reference no. 353075) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and humidified air for maximum 6 weeks. The medium was replaced weekly or bi-weekly to supply nutrients to support the growth of juvenile worms. For cultures intended for screening, scoring was performed on days 1, 7 post-transformation (p.t.) and then again weekly until maximum week 6 p.t. In optimization studies, an additional viability scoring timepoint at day 3 p.t. was included.\n\n## Criteria for the viability score\nThe viability of NTS was scored using an Axiovert10 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) according to the scoring system described in [14]. This scoring system of NTS cultures was based on three main criteria: motility, morphology, and granularity. The score ranged from 0: dead parasites, no movement, dense granulation, blurred outline, rough outer tegument with blebs; to 1: notably reduced motility, rough outer tegument with some blebs; to 2: reduced motility or increased uncoordinated activity, intact tegument with small deformations, slight granularity; and 3: regular smooth contractions, a smooth outer surface without blebs, no granulation with a clear view of internal structures which are visible under bright field microscopy. During the mechanical transformation, individual NTS die and are, therefore, present from the beginning in culture. The number of dead parasites is taken into account when determining the viability score. An increase in the number of dead parasites will decrease the overall viability score. Viability was scored at indicated time points. Each score is an overall impression of the visual appearance of all NTS per well. Viability scores 0\u20133 were further subdivided into 0.25 steps (e.g. 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) to capture delicate changes in the appearance of NTS.\nFor the determination of different developmental stages, the morphological determination was based on previously published work [14,16,17]. The skin stage (SkS) appears similar to the cercarial head in shape with undirected regular movements; the lung stage (LuS) is characterized by an increase in length and decrease in diameter. Early LiS shows clear visibility of the gut; growth of the parasite is initially observed in diameter and then in length. In the late LiS, oral and ventral suckers are recognizable, and the body length increases. The increase in body length is especially prominent past the ventral sucker.\n\n## Growth promotion in different lots of human serum\nDonor human serum (HSe) was prepared from the blood of healthy volunteers with no previous history of schistosomiasis upon written consent. Fresh blood was collected in S-Monovette\u00ae Serum (Sarstedt, Cat. No. 01.1601), left at room temperature for 30\u201360 min to clot, then centrifuged twice at 2000 x g for 10 min. Serum was collected, pooled from 11 individuals and stored at -20\u00b0C until further use. Lots of commercial human serum originated from human male AB plasma, USA origin (Cat. No. H4522, Sigma-Aldrich), male AB clotted whole blood (Cat. No. H6914, Sigma-Aldrich), and from off clot pooled mixed gender, EU (Cat. No. S-106B-EU, Batch number A50618, Life Science Group).\nHM supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin without the addition of HSe served as a control. The medium was replenished weekly, and viability scoring was performed on day 1, 3 and 7 p.t., and then every 7 days. Developmental stages were determined by bright field microscopy using an inverted Axiovert 10 microscope (Zeiss). For each culture condition, experiments were performed at least in triplicates.\nFor primary screening, the culture medium contained either 20% donor or commercial (S-106B-EU) HSe. For confirmatory testing of compounds on juveniles and adult worms, commercial HSe (S-106B-EU) was supplemented in culture medium at 20%.\n\n## Collection of adult worms\nThree-week-old male NMRI mice were purchased from Envigo, Germany. Mice were infected with approximately 200\u2013300 S. mansoni cercariae (NMRI strain) subcutaneously. After 8\u20139 weeks post-infection, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation or pentobarbital. Worms were collected from the portal vein and mesenteric veins under a heated plate dissecting microscope. Adult worms were placed in a Petri dish with the culture medium on the same day after harvesting from mice, washed once, and gently transferred into 6-well plate with culture medium and left 1\u20132 days at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 before confirmatory testing. The culture medium for adult worms was the same as for juveniles and consisted of HybridoMed Diff 1000 (HM) (Cat. No. F 8055/1, Biochrom GmbH, Germany) supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\n## Liquid compounds\nFor primary screening, compounds were supplied dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and stored at -20\u00b0C until use. On the day of screening, compounds were left to equilibrate for at least 60 minutes at room temperature (RT). If screenings were performed within a month, plates with compounds were left in a desiccator at RT to avoid continuous freezing and thawing cycles.\nPZQ (Cat. No. PHR1391 Sigma-Aldrich) served as a positive control, while DMSO (Cat. No. D8418 Sigma) was used as a negative control. On the day of testing, PZQ was freshly prepared by weighing and dissolving in DMSO to reach a stock concentration of 10 mM.\n\n## Solid compounds\nFor confirmatory screening on juveniles and adult worms, compounds were delivered in solid powder form and stored in the dark at RT until use. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO taking into an account the weight (g) and molecular weight of each compound to reach a stock concentration of 10 mM. The same was done for PZQ. After the addition of DMSO, vials with compounds and PZQ were vortexed at least 3x10 seconds to ensure homogeneous suspension. Reconstituted vials with compounds were kept at 5\u00b0C between experiments on juveniles and adult worms. Plate dilutions were prepared in 96-well plate for juveniles and 24-well plate for adult worms. All plate dilutions intended for primary and confirmatory screenings were performed in a laminar flow cabinet.\n\nOn the day of testing, 21\u201342 day-old juveniles (depending on a study), liver stages (early and late) were scored before the addition of compounds, corresponding to time point 0 hours before drug treatment. Each well had to contain at least 3\u20134 late liver stages to be selected for screening. In the case of NMRI strain, the majority of juveniles were in an early liver stage. After selection of wells for screening, 96-well plate containing juveniles were washed 3x with HM supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin to remove metabolites and waste generated during cultivation. For primary screening, preparation of compounds and controls was performed in two 96-well plates. In plate 1, compounds and PZQ were diluted to 100 \u03bcM in distilled water, and further diluted in HM supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin, 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin and 20% HSe (hereafter termed culture medium) in plate 2. After juveniles were washed 3x with HM supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, the supernatant was removed, and 150 \u03bcL of plate 2 was transferred to wells with worms (plate 3). The final concentration of tested compounds and PZQ was 30 \u03bcM. DMSO was tested at 0.3% v/v (volume by volume; representative of the highest solvent concentration). Compounds were tested in single replicates and controls in duplicates.\nFor confirmatory screening, compounds and PZQ were diluted in distilled water to 100 \u03bcM in plate 1. From plate 1, compounds and PZQ were further diluted in the culture medium on plate 2 to three concentrations: 3.333 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, and 30 \u03bcM. The final concentration of DMSO on plate 2 was 0.3% v/v. As in the case of primary screening, wells containing juvenile worms (plate 3) were washed 3x in HM supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, after which, the supernatant was removed, and 150 \u03bcL of plate 2 was transferred to wells with worms. DMSO was tested at 0.3% v/v (representative of the highest solvent concentration). Compounds, PZQ, and DMSO, were tested in duplicates.\nFor primary and confirmatory screening, after the addition of compounds, worms were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, and scored after 3 hours (h), 24 hours, and day 7 post-treatment using an inverted Axiovert 10 microscope (Zeiss) at 10x magnification.\nPrimary screening was performed using S. mansoni, NMRI strain, except in one study (Thioproperazine in Table 1). In this study, thioproperazine screened as a hit on liver stages of S. mansoni, Brazilian strain. Confirmation of primary hits was always carried out with the NMRI strain. As the majority of schistosomula in each well were in liver stage for NMRI strain, and the aim was to assess the activity of compounds on juveniles, viability score was assigned only to liver stages. Consequently, during primary screening and confirmation, hits were determined if the viability score of liver stage (early and late) was \u2264 1.25 at 24 h after exposure to compounds. Thus, the effect of compounds on lung stages was not considered when assigning a viability score. All information on the phenotype of lung stages in Table 1 is for information only.\n\nOn the day of screening, plates with adult worms were inspected under an inverted Axiovert 10 microscope (Zeiss) at 5x magnification. Gently using forceps, male and female worms transferred into 24-well plate containing the culture medium. Each well included at least 3 male and 3 female worms. More specifically, each well either contained individual worms or 2 male and 2 female as single worms and 1 pair. After the selection of adult worms, plates with worms and culture medium were placed in a laminar flow cabinet.\nIn plate 1, compounds and PZQ were diluted in distilled water to 100 \u03bcM. From plate 1, 450 \u03bcL was transferred to plate 2 already containing adults worms in culture medium to a final volume 1500 \u03bcL. Compounds and PZQ were screened at 30 \u03bcM, and DMSO at 0.3% v/v (representative of the highest solvent concentration). Compounds, PZQ, and DMSO, were tested in duplicates. After the addition of compounds, plates with worms were placed at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Viability scoring was performed after 3, 24, and 72 h post-treatment under an inverted Axiovert 10 microscope (Zeiss) at 5x and 10x magnification. Hits were confirmed if the average viability score was \u2264 1.25 at 24 h after exposure to compounds. After a 24-hour exposure, compounds and controls were washed 3x in HM supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, after which adult worms were then incubated in culture medium only.\n\n## Drug wash-out after a 24-hour incubation time\nTo monitor the effect of compounds on worm cultures, i.e. reversible or irreversible, compounds and controls were removed after a 24-hour exposure from juvenile and adult worm cultures during primary and confirmatory screenings. The supernatant containing compounds was discarded, and worms were washed 3x in HM supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. After the third wash, the supernatant was removed, and the culture medium was added to each well. Plates were returned to the incubator at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. The final viability score as a measure of recovery was done on day 7 and day 3 from the initial screening for juvenile and adult worms, respectively.\n\n## Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nS. mansoni juveniles were cultured in the culture medium containing commercial human serum (S-106B-EU) until day 29. Juveniles were collected in protein low binding Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 x g at 22\u00b0C. The supernatant containing the culture medium was discarded. Samples were treated to series of sequential steps: Fixation (4% glutaraldehyde and 0.2 M cacodylate), 1st wash (0.4 M saccharose / 0.2 M cacodylate), post-fixation (2% osmic acid / 0.3 M cacodylate), 2nd wash (distilled water) followed by ethanol dehydration at 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% concentration. Samples were then air-dried, mounted, and coated with gold sputter before imaging.\n\n## Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nSchistosomula 29 days (7 weeks) and 77 days (11 weeks) old were fixed in buffered 2.5% Glutaraldehyde phosphate (0.2 mol/L, pH 7.4) in 0.1 M Sodium cacodylate. Post-fixation was carried out in cold buffered 1% Osmium tetraoxide, followed by dehydration in ascending gradients of ethanol (50%, 70%, 90%, 100%) before embedding in Epoxy resin. Samples were embedded in Epon (Serva Electrophoresis GmbH). 60\u201370 nm thick ultrathin sections were cut at the Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome (Darmstadt, Germany) microtome. Ultrathin sections were collected on formvar coated copper grids (Plano, Germany) and automatically stained with UranyLess EM Stain (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 3% lead citrate (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) using the contrasting system Leica EM AC20 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Imaging was carried out using the JEOL -1200 EXII transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Akishima, Tokyo) at 80 kV. Images were taken from the dorsal surface of the worm using a digital camera (KeenViewII; Olympus, Germany) and processed with the iTEM software package (anlySISFive; Olympus, Germany).\n\n## Computational chemistry\nPhysiochemical properties of compounds were calculated using the CDK package in KNIME Analytics Platform v3.6.1 [18]. Statistical significance of differences between properties of active and inactive compounds was measured by the Student\u2019s t-test p-value. Three properties were found significantly different. XLogP is a measure of the octanol/water partition coefficient. Compounds with larger XLogP values are more lipophilic. Bond polarizability is the ability of a bond to form instantaneous dipoles. Polarizabilities determine the dynamical response of a bound system to external fields and provide insight into a molecule\u2019s internal structure. Fragment complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of a molecule.\n\n## Calculation of Z\u2019- factor and SSMD\nZ\u2019-factor is a statistical parameter used for quality assessment during assay development and optimization, which takes into consideration positive and negative assay controls without the interference of test compounds. Z\u2019-factor values of 0.5\u20131 indicate excellent assay performance. Calculation of Z\u2019-factor was done as described in [19] as follows:\nZ\u2032=1-(3\u03c3c++3\u03c3c-)|\u03bcc+-\u03bcc-|\nWhere,\n\u03c3c+ is the standard deviation of positive control\n\u03c3c- is the standard deviation of negative control\n\u03bc c+ is the mean of positive control\n\u03bc c- is the mean of negative control\nAnother, more robust, statistical parameter to evaluate assay performance is the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD). The recommended threshold as an indicator of data quality is SSMD of 6 [20].\nCalculation of SSMD was performed as described in [20]:\nSSMD=\u03bch.c.\u2212\u03bcl.c/\u03c32h.c+\u03c32l.c\nWhere,\n\u03c3 h.c. is the standard deviation of high control (signal from negative control, DMSO)\n\u03c3 l.c. is the standard deviation of low control (signal from positive control, PZQ)\n\u03bc h.c. is the mean of high control (signal from negative control, DMSO)\n\u03bc l.c. is the mean of low control (signal from positive control, PZQ)\n\n## Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis and preparation of graphs were done using PRISM 8 (GraphPad). Data were tested for normality in PRISM 8. One-way ANOVA using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test was used to compare multiple test groups. Comparison between two groups was performed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (Compare ranks). In all cases, p \u2264 0.05 was considered significant.\n\n## Growth of juveniles under \nOur recently developed in vitro culture system to generate juvenile worms depends on a reliable source of human serum which up to now was an in-house serum pool derived from individual donors. To standardize the procedure, different lots of commercial human serum showed pronounced differences in the development of worms. Schistosomula incubated in commercial human serum, C_HSe_1 (H4522) and C_HSe_2 (H6914) and the culture medium alone, showed steady overtime decline in viability score (Fig 1A). In HM supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (HM/Pen-Strep), worms did not develop beyond the lung stage (Fig 1B). Already at day 7, the viability of schistosomula in C_HSe_1 was significantly lower compared to the ones incubated in donor serum (D_HSe), p = 0.0018 and commercial serum from EU origin (S-106B-EU, C_HSe_3), p = 0.0004. This significant downward trend in the viability of schistosomula grown in C_HSe_1 continued at day 14 and day 21 (Fig 1A). At day 21, schistosomula cultured in C_HSe_2 had a viability score 1.6 \u00b1 0.1, and significantly lower than in D_HSe (2.4 \u00b1 0.1, p = 0.0054) and C_HSe_3 (2.4 \u00b1 0.1, p = 0.0190), Fig 1A. The impaired growth in C_HSe_1 and C_HSe_2 was confirmed with development halting at the early LiS at day 21 (Fig 1D and 1E). As shown by images taken at day 21, the early LiS appeared stunted in growth in the presence of deformed and dead parasites, Fig 1G. Contrary to C_HSe_1 and C_HSe_2, incubation of schistosomula in C_HSe_3 (Fig 1F) promoted worm growth. Overtime viability score stayed comparable between D_HSe and C_HSe_3. Similarly, development at days 1\u201321 followed the similar trend, however, with a higher percentage of late LiS in C_HSe_3 (Fig 1F) compared to D_HSe (Fig 1C) (3 \u00b1 1% versus 8 \u00b1 3%, respectively; mean \u00b1 standard deviation). As seen in Fig 1G, juvenile worms incubated in C_HSe_3 developed to early and late LiS with a shaped oral and ventral sucker, clearly outlined bifurcated gut, and intact body at day 21, as seen under bright field microscopy. Similar observations in shape and form of LiS were seen when incubated in D_HSe (Fig 1G): However, these advanced LiS were visually smaller when compared to C_HSe_3, so were those raised in commercial serum originating from the US donors (C_HSe_1 and C_HSe_2). This was especially observed in the case of C_HSe_2, whereby worms appeared disintegrated with some LiS darker in colour and heavily granulated (Fig 1G).\nFrom Fig 1, commercial human serum, code S-106B-EU (pooled, mixed gender, off clot) showed comparable performance in the viability of the parasites and development of liver stages (early and late) compared to serum from donors. This allows reproducibility and sustained access to similar batches. Therefore, all following cultivation experiments were performed using commercial human serum S-106B-EU (C_HSe_3).\nNext, we aimed at optimizing the assay by evaluating whether a decrease in NTS from 100 to 50 per well would either maintain or increase the viability and the rate of development. As shown in Fig 2A, viability score had a similar trend among the two groups. At day 28, viability score was significantly higher in the group with the initial approximately 50 NTS per well (p = 0.0288). As shown in Fig 2B and 2C, similar developmental patterns were observed in the \u201c50 NTS\u201d and \u201c100 NTS\u201d group. The majority of worms developed from schistosomula (day 1) to LuS on day 7. From day 7 onwards, early LiS started developing, and their number increased steadily in both groups from day 14 to day 28 (Fig 2B and 2C). However, late LiS developed in higher numbers in the 50 NTS group at day 21 (9% \u00b1 5% in 50 NTS versus 2 \u00b1 2% in 100 NTS group) and day 28 (12 \u00b1 3% in 50 NTS versus 5 \u00b1 3% in 100 NTS group), respectively. Furthermore, individual late liver stages in the 50 NTS group appeared bigger compared to the 100 NTS group, as seen in Fig 2D.\nTaken together, these results show that decreasing the number of NTS from 100 to 50 gave a steady viability score at different time points and a higher percentage of late LiS. Consequently, decreasing the initial NTS per well increased the output of screened compounds, and further optimized the assay.\nFurther, we investigated whether there is a strain-specific development when subjecting S. mansoni Brazilian and NMRI strains to the same in vitro culture conditions. Percent of development was monitored over three weeks. As shown in Fig 3, the Brazilian (Fig 3A) and NMRI (Fig 3B) worms showed a clear difference in the pace of development. While both groups were in schistosomula stage at day 1, at day 11, the majority of parasites remained as LuS in the Brazilian strain (Fig 3A), with 14 \u00b1 6% early LiS and 0.4 \u00b1 0.8% late LiS developed at day 21 (Fig 3A). Contrary to slow pace development of the Brazilian strain, the NMRI strain developed faster. At day 11, the majority of worms were in early LiS (72 \u00b1 4%) and remained the main larval stage until day 21 (Fig 3B). By day 21, 10 \u00b1 2% NMRI worms have grown to late LiS (Fig 3B). Over time development of the NMRI strain from day 1 to 21 is presented in S1 Fig. As shown in S1 Fig, by day 7, schistosomula developed to lung stage and early liver stage in 20% human serum. An increase in early liver stages was observed at day 14 and 21. Late liver stages were seen on day 21 (S1 Fig). Although the NMRI worms developed faster, their viability significantly decreased from day 21 onwards (S2 Fig). Thus, at day 21, viability at day 21 was significantly higher compared to viability at days 28, 35, and 42 (p < 0.0001).\nFurthermore, the lowest viability was recorded at day 42 (p < 0.0001 compared to day 28 and p = 0.0005 compared to day 35). Data, therefore, shows that screening of worms is recommended at peak viability, i.e., day 21. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that the choice of parasite strain and their inherent pace of development is an important consideration when choosing the time point of the compound screening. Within the same S. mansoni strain, i.e., NMRI or Brazilian strain, time of testing is very much dependent on the right balance between the development to late liver stages and peak viability.\nThe electron microscopic examination of the 29\u2013day old schistosomula tegument (NMRI strain) from its dorsal side showed a granular cytoplasm containing scattered small mitochondria and many inclusion bodies that differ in size and shape (S3A\u2013S3C Fig). Some have a large central electron-dense core and a lucid periphery. Invaginations in the tegument can be seen giving the tegument a sponge-like appearance. Erupting spines that face posteriorly are featured in the tegument (S3C Fig). A basal membrane separates the tegument from the underlying body parenchyma. Directly beneath the basal membrane, an external layer of circular muscle is seen situated above an internal layer of longitudinal muscle. Myocytes forming the body wall musculature of the schistosomula are seen embedded and surrounded by the parenchyma and the basal layer of the tegument. They extend in long, tortuous processes (myofibers) throughout the schistosomula. In their densely granular sarcoplasm lie the large, irregularly-shaped and heterochromatic nucleoli. Size analyses via SEM revealed schistosomula with a length of about 0.75 mm, round in shape and with clearly visible and well-developed oral and ventral suckers. Their tegument shows ruffle-like folds with each fold showing outgrowths and indentations (S5A\u2013S5E Fig).\nTEM of the 77\u2013day old parasite tegument shows the exact characteristics of the 29\u2013day old schistosomula described above except that the spines are larger in size and more in number (S4A\u2013S4C Fig). Abnormal or damaged mitochondria with edema and loss of cristae are depicted in S4C Fig. Taken together, the results by TEM show that advanced development under these in vitro conditions can already be reached by day 29.\n\n## Part 2: Screening of compounds\nScreening of compounds was performed in several stages, as shown in Fig 4. The first phase, \u201cprimary screening\u201d was performed on 340 compounds from NCATS library. In vitro cultured juvenile worms were screened in singlets at the concentration 30 \u03bcM. Hits were determined if the viability score was \u2264 1.25 at 24 h before compounds were washed by three changes of HM medium supplemented with 200 U/mL penicillin and 200 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Afterwards, worms were incubated in the culture medium only. Out of 340 compounds, 20 compounds were identified as primary hits. In the next step, these hits were then tested on in vitro juvenile worms at three concentrations (3.333 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, and 30 \u03bcM) in duplicates. The same compounds were also tested on adult worms at a single concentration, 30 \u03bcM. In both juveniles and adult worms, hits were determined if the average viability score per concentration was \u2264 1.25. From 20 primary hits, 12 compounds were confirmed on juveniles and 2 on adult worms (Fig 4). Details on hits, viability scores, and the description of phenotypes on juveniles are presented in",
