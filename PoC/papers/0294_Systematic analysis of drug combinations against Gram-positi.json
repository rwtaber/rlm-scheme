We profiled ~8,000 combinations of 65 antibacterial drugs against the model species Bacillus subtilis and two prominent pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thereby, we recapitulated previously known drug interactions, but also identified ten times more novel interactions in the pathogen S. aureus, including 150 synergies. We showed that two synergies were equally effective against multidrug-resistant S. aureus clinical isolates in vitro and in vivo. Interactions were largely species-specific and synergies were distinct from those of Gram-negative species, owing to cell surface and drug uptake differences. We also tested 2,728 combinations of 44 commonly prescribed non-antibiotic drugs with 62 drugs with antibacterial activity against S. aureus and identified numerous antagonisms that might compromise the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies. We identified even more synergies and showed that the anti-aggregant ticagrelor synergized with cationic antibiotics by modifying the surface charge of S. aureus.

  "full_text": "## Main\nAntibacterial agents have been used in combination for decades for different purposes: to achieve synergy (for example, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim), to limit resistance (for example, combinations of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors, or antitubercular regimens) and/or to broaden the spectrum of action of anti-infective treatments (for example, empiric treatments of sepsis)1. With antimicrobial resistance (AMR) posing a global threat to public health, which permeates all domains of modern medicine2,3, the use of drug combinations to re-sensitize resistant strains has emerged as a promising means to bypass the stagnant drug discovery pipeline4.\nAlthough a few antibacterial combinations are used in clinics, and screens for approved compounds as adjuvants for antibiotics have been increasingly conducted in the past decade5\u201310, the full potential of drug combinations for treating bacterial pathogens remains underexplored. This is because the combinatorial space is vast and drug interactions are rare and concentration-, drug-, time-, species- and even strain-specific11\u201313, making systematic testing necessary, yet highly demanding. As a result, drug interactions have not yet been systematically profiled in many clinically relevant bacterial species. In addition, with the increase of polypharmacy14, antibiotics are often prescribed in combination with other medications15. While pharmacokinetic interactions between antibiotics and non-antibiotic drugs are well-known for the host (for example, dependencies on drug metabolism and excretion by the liver and the kidney)16, they are poorly characterized at the level of bacterial physiology.\nHere we used an automated platform to systematically profile drug interactions against three Gram-positive bacterial species: the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, two of the most prominent antibiotic-resistant bacteria2,17 and the model organism Bacillus subtilis. Compared with previous studies7,9,18, this vastly increased the number of drugs, concentrations and strains tested. By probing all main classes of antibiotics, we could relate interaction outcomes to bacterial structural features, cellular network architecture, as well as drug target conservation. When comparing the drug interaction networks to those of three Gram-negative pathogens obtained with a similar setup11, we could highlight clear differences driven by the distinct drug permeability barriers across this divide. Moreover, we profiled the interactions of antibiotics with a large panel of non-antibiotic drugs in S. aureus to investigate the impact of commonly administered medications on antibiotic efficacy. Thereby, we uncovered both strong synergies that proved effective against multidrug-resistant clinical S. aureus isolates and widespread antagonisms that could compromise the efficacy of antibiotic treatments.\n\n## Automated high-throughput testing of drug combinations\nWe profiled 1,891\u20132,070 drug combinations in a 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 dose matrix (2-fold dilution gradient) in S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and B. subtilis (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). For S. aureus, two strains (Newman and DSM 20231) were probed to assess within-species conservation. The drug panel (n\u2009=\u200965) included antibiotics (n\u2009=\u200957) used against infections with Gram-positive bacteria, belonging to all main classes and targeting different bacterial processes, and eight other bioactive molecules, such as antifungals, drugs with human targets and food additives, depicted as non-antibiotics (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2).Fig. 1Drug\u2013drug interactions are species-specific in Gram-positive bacteria.a, Schematic representation of the high-throughput screen. Pairwise combinations of 65 drugs belonging to several chemical classes and targeting different cellular processes (Supplementary Table 2) were tested at three concentrations in S. aureus (two strains), B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae. For each strain, 1,891\u20132,070 combinations were tested in broth microdilution in 384-well plates, measuring OD595 over time. Normalized fitness values were calculated and used to obtain 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 checkerboards and assign interactions as synergistic, antagonistic or neutral (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3). PMF, proton-motive force. b, Interaction abundance in each strain separately and altogether. Synergy and antagonism frequencies were obtained by dividing their absolute counts by the number of combinations for which the probed fitness space allows detection of synergy (fitness upon combination \u22650.1) or antagonism (fitness upon combination \u22640.9) discovery (Methods). Total numbers of combinations tested (n) and detected interactions (i) are shown for each set. c, Conservation of interactions among the four strains tested. All unique interactions detected in the screen (n\u2009=\u2009725) were considered to calculate intersection sets between strains. The total number of interactions dependent on whether conserved or unique to each strain/species are shown. A total of 81 interactions (i), involving 47 drugs (d), are conserved across species (dark red). The total number of interactions in each strain is indicated as set size (bottom right), adding up to 945 total interactions in all strains. d, Network of conserved interactions between Gram-positive species. Drugs are grouped according to their targeted cellular process (Supplementary Table 2). Edge thickness is proportional to the number of drug\u2013drug interactions for each class\u2013class pair. Node size is proportional to the number of drugs in each class. Only drugs involved in this interaction set are considered (d\u2009=\u200947). Nodes are coloured according to the targeted cellular processes as in Fig. 1a. e, Drug interaction conservation between species recapitulates phylogeny. Pearson correlation between sequence identity (based on 40 conserved marker genes) and drug interaction conservation rate is between pairs of species tested here and previously11. The P value was obtained from a two-tailed one-sample t-test assessing the significance of the Pearson correlation (H0: {t\u2009=\u20090, R\u2009=\u20090}).Source data\nWe measured growth in a broth microdilution format in microtitre plates using optical density at 595\u2009nm (OD595) as a readout. Media and shaking conditions were different for each species (Methods). Drug concentrations were tailored after measuring minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the drug concentrations causing 50% growth inhibition (IC50s) for each drug in the four strains, with the highest concentration corresponding to the MIC in most cases, and the intermediate and lowest concentration corresponding to half and a quarter of the highest concentration, respectively (Methods and Supplementary Table 2). We derived fitness values in the presence of single drugs and drug combinations, dividing single-timepoint OD595 values upon drug treatment by the corresponding values of no-drug controls at the same timepoint. This timepoint was different for each strain and corresponded to the entry to stationary phase in the absence of drugs, allowing us to capture drug effects on both growth rate and yield (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). We conducted all experiments in biological (that is, different overnight cultures) and technical (that is, inoculated wells in the same plate) duplicates, achieving high replicate correlations (average Pearson correlation of 0.84\u20130.89 for biological (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) and 0.91 for technical replicates (Extended Data Fig. 2c)). Fitness based on single-timepoint OD595 and area under the growth-curve (AUC) led to very similar results, with the former being more accurate (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). In contrast, fitness values based only on growth rate had a lower correlation to the two other metrics, overestimating fitness for some drug treatments (Extended Data Fig. 2f,g). For single-drug fitness, we used estimated values derived from the combination experiments, as they were concordant with experimental measurements and were derived from more data points (Extended Data Fig. 2h,i and Methods). From the 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 concentration matrices of fitness values, we calculated interaction scores using the Bliss interaction model19 (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1). A single effect-size value was derived from the distribution of interaction scores for each drug pair (at least 72 scores, including all replicates of individual concentration combinations). The first and third quartile values of this distribution were taken as effect-size values for synergies and antagonisms, respectively, with negative values corresponding to synergies and positive values to antagonisms (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3)11. All interaction data are available for browsing in a user-friendly interface (https://apps.embl.de/combact/).\nTo calibrate hit scoring, as well as to assess the high-throughput screen data quality, we benchmarked the screen data against a validation set of 161 combinations (2% of screened combinations), equally representing the four strains probed. These combinations were tested in the same growth conditions as our high-throughput screen, but over a highly resolved dose space (8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 matrix) of linearly spaced concentration gradients (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Table 4). The precision\u2013recall curves were comparable to the previous Gram-negative screen11, with highest precision (0.87) and recall (0.68) observed for a threshold on absolute effect size of >0.1 and on Benjamini\u2013Hochberg adjusted P value of <0.05 (resampling procedure with 10,000 repetitions for each combination tested, comparison with resampled Bliss scores using Wilcoxon rank-sum test in each iteration) (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3c). The lower recall was linked to our increased ability to detect mild interactions in the extended 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 concentration matrices of the benchmarking dataset and is a direct trade-off for the high precision cut-off we set in the screen to limit false positives. We were able to increase the recall to 0.72 by relaxing the effect-size thresholds for interactions found in both S. aureus strains, using within-species conservation as an additional parameter to confirm interactions11 (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Table 3).\nAlthough the Loewe interaction model20 was inadequate for the main screen (Methods), the extended concentration space probed in the benchmarking set allowed us to assess interactions also using this model. After excluding drug pairs for which the Loewe interaction model could not be used (n\u2009=\u200924; single drugs had no inhibitory effect) or was unreliable (n\u2009=\u200969; Methods and Supplementary Information), we found that the two models mostly agreed in assessing interactions (n\u2009=\u200946/68, Extended Data Fig. 4a\u2013d and Supplementary Information). Importantly, the overall interaction scores of two models were significantly correlated, even for drug pairs for which the Loewe model was deemed unreliable (Extended Data Fig. 4b), and was considerably higher than in previous reports21,22. Only three interactions were captured just by the Loewe model (Supplementary Information), none of which were detected in the screen (Extended Data Fig. 4e). In contrast, out of the 19 interactions captured only by the Bliss model, 15 were concordant with the Loewe model in the sign of interaction but were missed due to the arbitrary confidence threshold (Methods and Supplementary Information). In agreement with arbitrary confidence thresholds driving the residual disagreement between the two models, concordant interactions were overall stronger in both models (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g and Supplementary Table 5).\n\n## Drug interactions are rare and species-specific\nAntagonisms and synergies were detected to be equally prevalent across the three species, accounting for ~12% of all combinations tested (Fig. 1b). This interaction rate, corrected by our ability to detect synergies or antagonisms based on the concentration space probed for each combination (Methods), is lower and less skewed towards antagonisms as compared with Gram-negative species (15% altogether considering E. coli, S. Typhimurium and P. aeruginosa)11. This could be due to technical (drug or strain selection biases, testing one strain in B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae, which prevents the use of within-species conservation to retrieve more interactions11) or biological reasons (Gram-positive bacteria having a lower drug permeability bottleneck than Gram-negative bacteria and hence less antagonisms; see also Discussion).\nSpecies-specificity of drug interactions has long been assumed23 and recently systematically demonstrated for Gram-negative species, with 30% of detected interactions shared between at least two of the three species tested and 5% conserved in all three species (E. coli, S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa)11. In Gram-positive species, we observed an even lower conservation rate (Fig. 1c), with only 81 out of 725 unique interactions (11.2%) conserved in at least two species (Fig. 1d). Some 29 interactions were conserved in all three species (4%) (Supplementary Table 3). We reasoned that the lower interspecies conservation in our screen could be driven by the strain and species selection in the two screens. For Gram-negative species, two closely related Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli and S. Typhimurium, exhibited the highest overlap of interactions11, but the interaction conservation rate of either of these two species with P. aeruginosa is similar to the cross-species conservation rates we detected for Gram-positive bacteria. Indeed, when we compared the interaction conservation rate and genome sequence percentage identity (based on 40 universal single-copy marker genes24), the two were significantly correlated (Methods and Fig.1e).\nIn contrast to Gram-negative bacteria11, we could not observe a significant enrichment for synergies among conserved interactions, even after removing non-antibiotic drugs for which intracellular targets and their conservation are unknown (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Conserved synergies were mostly driven by drugs targeting the same essential and highly conserved cellular processes, such as DNA biosynthesis and translation (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Some of these interactions, such as the synergy between macrolides and tetracyclines or between quinolones of different generations, have been observed before in Gram-negative species11,25, pointing towards conserved relationships between the targets of these compounds. Similarly, the broad antagonism between drugs targeting DNA and protein synthesis (Fig. 1d) is conserved in Gram-negative bacteria and is due to the alleviation of protein\u2013DNA imbalance after treatment with any of the two antibiotics alone26. Overall, we detected 52 synergies and 66 antagonisms shared across the Gram-positive/-negative divide (Extended Data Fig. 5c\u2013e and Supplementary Table 6).\n\n## Numerous previously unknown drug synergies for \nWe built separate interaction networks for each of the three species tested and grouped drugs according to their class or cellular target (Fig. 2a,b and Extended Data Fig. 6). Although individual drug\u2013drug interactions were rarely conserved (Fig. 1c), interactions between drug classes or targeted processes were more coherent in all three species. This functional concordance became even clearer when comparing drugs on the basis of all their interactions with other drugs. Interaction-based clustering better recapitulated drug functional classes (Extended Data Fig. 7a and Methods) than clustering on the basis of chemical structures (Extended Data Fig. 7b and Methods), suggesting that drug interactions capture more information on drug mode of action than their chemical features.Fig. 2Novel synergies against S. aureus clinical isolates.a,b, Drug interaction networks in S. aureus, with drugs grouped according to their class (a) or targeted cellular process (b). Unique interactions across both strains tested are considered (i\u2009=\u2009331). Edge thickness represents the proportion of interactions for each node pair, considering all possible interactions given the number of drugs in each node. Nodes depict the drug class (a) or the targeted cellular process (b), and size is proportional to the number of drugs in the represented class/process. Only interacting drugs are considered (d\u2009=\u200962). Synergies, antagonisms and nodes are coloured according to Fig. 1. c, Novel and previously reported interactions detected in S. aureus. Interactions are considered known if reported in any S. aureus strain (Supplementary Table 7). d,e, Identified synergies are effective against MRSA clinical isolates in vitro (d) and in vivo in the G. mellonella infection model (e). Teicoplanin (TEC) synergies with cefepime (FEP) and trimethoprim (TMP) were validated against a tigecycline-resistant MRSA clinical isolate (Supplementary Table 1) in 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 broth microdilution checkerboards (d) and in the G. mellonella infection model (e). For checkerboards, the median fitness (OD595 at 7.5\u2009h normalized by no-drug controls) across two biological replicates is shown (Supplementary Information). For G. mellonella experiments, larvae were infected with the same MRSA isolate and treated with single drugs or combinations. The percentage of surviving larvae after treatment and in the untreated controls was monitored over time. Uninfected and untreated (vehicle only) controls are shown. Drugs were tested in combination at the same concentration indicated for each drug. Data indicate mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e. (n\u2009=\u200910 for each condition, three independent experiments).Source data\nSince S. aureus is the most relevant Gram-positive species with respect to AMR-attributable deaths2, we systematically screened literature for reported drug interactions in this species. Out of 331 unique interactions detected across the two S. aureus strains in our study, we could find only 31 that have been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 7). Some 55 further interactions have been reported in other bacterial species (Supplementary Table 7). Even when excluding those, our dataset revealed 127 novel synergies for S. aureus (and 118 antagonisms), a third of which (n\u2009=\u200939) was conserved in both strains. This confirms that the combinatorial space is a largely unexplored reservoir for improving antimicrobial efficacy.\nKnown interactions include many conserved synergies between drugs with the same targets (Fig. 1d), such as synergies between DNA biosynthesis inhibitors, protein synthesis inhibitors and cell-wall-targeting antibiotics (Fig. 2a,b). Among these latter, we confirmed the strong and previously reported synergy between two widely used antibiotics for S. aureus, cefepime and teicoplanin27,28, and validated it against several MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) clinical isolates belonging to worldwide prevalent clonal complexes and different infection sources (Supplementary Table 1), including a strain resistant to the last-resort antibiotic tigecycline (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Information). When we infected larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella with this MRSA strain, the combination protected the animals from succumbing to the infection in contrast to single drug treatments (Fig. 2e), confirming that the synergy works also in vivo.\nSynergies between cell-wall-targeting drugs and translation inhibitors are cornerstones of anti-infective therapy against Gram-positive bacteria29\u201332. We could recapitulate some of these synergies: for example, conserved synergies between bacitracin or oritavancin and aminoglycosides in S. aureus. In line with current literature and concerns on general effectiveness33\u201336, we could not detect synergies between beta-lactams and aminoglycosides in any of the three species tested. Despite the prevalent assumption that these combinations are highly effective, synergies occur only for specific species (or strains) and depend on dosage, infection site and specific antimicrobial agents33\u201336. In contrast, fosfomycin strongly synergized with a diverse range of protein synthesis inhibitors (Supplementary Table 7) and could present an underexploited therapeutic resource against S. aureus (see Discussion).\nAmong the 300 previously unknown interactions we detected, 19 out of 23 tested were further confirmed in the extended 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 checkerboard benchmarking assays (9 of which were in both S. aureus strains) (Supplementary Table 4). Interestingly, adjuvants, such as clavulanic acid, or antibiotics used in clinics only in fixed-concentration combinations (trimethoprim and sulfonamides), exhibited a number of previously unknown synergies with other drugs, unveiling a so-far unexplored space for new combinations. As an example, we validated the strong synergy of teicoplanin with trimethoprim against several MRSA clinical isolates in vitro (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Information) and in vivo in a G. mellonella infection model (Fig. 2e).\n\n## Target-specific synergies in Gram-positive/-negative species\nDrugs belonging to the same class or targeting the same cellular process exhibited mainly synergistic interactions in all three species (Fig. 2a,b, and Extended Data Figs. 6 and 8a). Indeed, synergies between drugs targeting the same process were significantly enriched (Fig. 3a), in agreement with previous data on Gram-negative bacteria11. Targeting different facets of the same cellular process can bypass the inbuilt redundancy and robustness of biological processes37. Importantly, the targeted cellular processes that were more prone to synergies were distinct when comparing Gram-positive and Gram-negative species (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). Synergies between protein synthesis inhibitors were specifically prevalent in Gram-positive species, whereas Gram-negative species were dominated by synergies between cell-wall inhibitors (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 8c\u2013f). Since the drugs between the two screens largely overlapped and their targets are conserved in bacteria, we decided to further investigate the underlying reason for this difference.Fig. 3Synergies between drugs targeting the same cellular process.a, Drugs targeting the same biological process often interact synergistically, whereas antagonisms are prevalent between drugs targeting different processes (S. aureus: ****P\u2009=\u20099.9\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127, \u03c72 test; S. pneumoniae: ****P\u2009=\u20094.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128, \u03c72 test). Interaction numbers are indicated in white inside the bars. Non-antibiotic drugs (n\u2009=\u20098) are excluded from this analysis, as their targeted processes are heterogeneous or unknown. b, Gram-positive species exhibit frequent synergistic interactions between protein synthesis inhibitors, whereas cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors predominantly synergize in Gram-negative species11. Prevalence of interactions between protein synthesis inhibitors and between cell-wall-biosynthesis inhibitors in Gram-negative and Gram-positive species is indicated as in Fig. 3a (for protein synthesis inhibitors: ****P\u2009=\u20091.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128; for cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors: **P\u2009=\u20090.0038, \u03c72 test). c, Protein synthesis inhibitors can also synergize in Gram-negative species when the drug permeability bottleneck is abolished. Synergistic combinations in Gram-positive species were tested in 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 broth microdilution checkerboards in wild-type E. coli and in the OM-defective E.coli lptD4213 strain40. Interaction score distributions for each combination are significantly different between the two strains. Interactions were assigned with the same criteria used in the screen, with synergies corresponding to distributions with first quartile <\u22120.1. The first quartile value is shown in all cases. CLR, clarithromycin; CLI, clindamycin; AZM, azithromycin; LZD, linezolid; CHL, chloramphenicol (CLR\u2009+\u2009CLI: ****P\u2009=\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216; CLR\u2009+\u2009AZM: ****P\u2009=\u20095.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213; CLR\u2009+\u2009CHL: ****P\u2009=\u20092.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221216; CLR\u2009+\u2009LZD: ****P\u2009=\u20094.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22128, two-sided Wilcoxon test; box limits correspond to first and third quartiles, with the median marked, and whiskers extending to the most extreme data points up to 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). d, Differences in beta-lactam synergy prevalence between Gram-negative and Gram-positive species are related to differences in drug target redundancy, that is, the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) they encode in their genomes. Pearson correlation between number of PBPs and the frequency of synergies between beta-lactams for each strain tested (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9) and the P value of a two-sided permutation test (100,000 permutations) are shown. Correlations and P values when using one strain per species are shown in Supplementary Table 10.Source data\nProtein synthesis inhibitors are mostly used against Gram-positive bacteria, as they often cannot cross the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria. We reasoned that in Gram-positive species with no such permeability bottleneck, these drugs could synergize at their target level, the ribosome, as previously shown by combinations of genetic perturbations of translation38. By contrast, in Gram-negative bacteria, the OM permeability bottleneck probably masks such synergistic interactions and enriches for antagonisms, which are often due to a decrease in drug intracellular concentration(s)11. We confirmed this hypothesis by using the OM-defective E.coli mutant lptD4213, which is hyperpermeable to hydrophobic antibiotics and detergents39,40. Many of the interactions between macrolides and different classes of protein synthesis inhibitors became synergistic in this E. coli mutant background (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Information), demonstrating that drug uptake bottlenecks can change antibiotic interactions.\nInteractions between beta-lactams were prominent in Gram-negative species, but rare in Gram-positive species (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). Beta-lactams have different affinities to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)41. Interestingly, the number and type of PBP are largely different across bacterial species41,42, leading us to hypothesize that this redundancy (number of PBP paralogues) drives the observed difference. Indeed, the number of synergies in each strain tested correlated with the number of PBPs encoded in their genomes (Fig. 3d, and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). The higher the number of PBPs, the higher the probability that combining beta-lactams with different affinities to the various PBPs will lead to a synergistic bypassing of the redundancy. Although this trend is based on a limited number of strains, it holds even when considering only one strain per species (Supplementary Table 10). While further studies are needed, we hypothesize that this target redundancy drives the synergies between beta-lactam antibiotics and that the difference we observed here between Gram-positive and -negative species probably depends on the number of PBPs in the species tested.\nAltogether, these results support the known concept that drug interactions mirror key properties of cellular networks43, such as their functional modularity and redundancy, and reflect fundamental differences in cellular architecture across the Gram-positive/-negative divide.\n\n## Interactions between non-antibiotics and antibiotics\nOur drug interaction screen included eight non-antibiotic drugs, which exhibited a similar interaction frequency (11%) as antibiotics (13%) (Fig. 4a). This motivated us to expand the panel of non-antibiotic drugs tested and to explore the range of synergies and antagonisms antibiotics exhibit with commonly used non-antibiotic medications in S. aureus. We selected 44 drugs to include pharmaceuticals that can be co-administered with antibiotics in S. aureus infections or non-antibiotics with previously reported antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Supplementary Table 11). Altogether, we covered 19 therapeutic classes (Extended Data Fig. 9a and Supplementary Table 11), testing each drug in a range of three concentrations and against the panel of 62 drugs of the initial screen (2,728 drug\u2013drug interactions, 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 dose matrix) in S. aureus DSM 20231. Concentrations were selected to fall within therapeutic plasma concentrations44, except for drugs with possible topical use, where higher concentrations were used. Interactions were scored and benchmarked as in the main screen (Methods, Supplementary Tables 12 and 13, and Extended Data Fig. 9a\u2013d).Fig. 4Interactions between non-antibiotic and antibiotic drugs in S. aureus.a, Interactions of non-antibiotic drugs between themselves and antibiotics are as common as interactions between two antibiotics. This motivated us to expand the non-antibiotic panel tested. Synergy and antagonism frequencies were calculated as in Fig. 1b. b, Interactions between non-antibiotics and antibiotics in the extended non-antibiotic screen in S. aureus DSM 20231. Additional non-antibiotic drugs (44) were screened in combination with 62 drugs belonging to the original drug panel, using the same experimental setup and the same data analysis pipeline, in S. aureus DSM 20231 (Methods). Synergy and antagonism frequencies were calculated as in Fig. 1b. c, Non-antibiotics with antibacterial activity, for which the MIC was among tested concentrations (n\u2009=\u200913), engage in more interactions than non-antibiotics for which there is no MIC or concentration was out of the tested range (n\u2009=\u200931). d, All interactions between non-antibiotics and antibiotics detected in S. aureus DSM 20231 in the original (i\u2009=\u200987) and in the extended (i\u2009=\u2009197) non-antibiotic screen.
