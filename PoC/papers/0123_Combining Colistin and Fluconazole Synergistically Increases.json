  "abstract": "The increasing emergence of drug-resistant fungal pathogens, together with the limited number of available antifungal drugs, presents serious clinical challenges to treating systemic, life-threatening infections. Repurposing existing drugs to augment the antifungal activity of well-tolerated antifungals is a promising antifungal strategy with the potential to be implemented rapidly. Here, we explored the mechanism by which colistin, a positively charged lipopeptide antibiotic, enhances the antifungal activity of fluconazole, the most widely used orally available antifungal. In a range of susceptible and drug-resistant isolates and species, colistin was primarily effective at reducing fluconazole tolerance, a property of subpopulations of cells that grow slowly in the presence of a drug and may promote the emergence of persistent infections and resistance. Clinically relevant concentrations of colistin synergized with fluconazole, reducing fluconazole minimum inhibitory concentration 4-fold. Combining fluconazole and colistin also increased survival in a C. albicans Galleria mellonella infection, especially for a highly fluconazole-tolerant isolate. Mechanistically, colistin increased permeability to fluorescent antifungal azole probes and to intracellular dyes, accompanied by an increase in cell death that was dependent upon pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. The positive charge of colistin is critical to its antifungal, and antibacterial, activity: colistin directly binds to several eukaryotic membrane lipids (i.e., l-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol, l-\u03b1-phosphatidyl-l-serine, and l-\u03b1-phosphatidylethanolamine) that are enriched in the membranes of ergosterol-depleted cells. These results support the idea that colistin binds to fungal membrane lipids and permeabilizes fungal cells in a manner that depends upon the degree of ergosterol depletion.",

  "full_text": "## Combining Fluconazole\nand Colistin (FLC+COL) Reduces Drug Tolerance\nand Resistance in \nColistin (COL) is known to enhance the\nantifungal efficacy of fluconazole (FLC), but whether this is largely\ndue to a reduction in drug resistance or tolerance is unclear. Using\ndisk diffusion assays with FLC (25 \u03bcg) in the disk and COL (64\n\u03bcg/mL) in the agar medium, we measured both resistance/susceptibility\nand tolerance to FLC using diskImageR,10 an image analysis pipeline that quantifies resistance/susceptibility\nas the radius (in mm) of the zone of inhibition at 20% inhibition\n(RAD20) after 24 h and the fraction of growth (FoG20) within the zone of inhibition at 48 h.7,10 The\naddition of COL reduced FoG20 to background levels, (i.e., levels seen with very low tolerance strains), while\nRAD20 increased only modestly (by \u223c3.5 mm) (Figure 1A and B). Thus, combining\nCOL with FLC primarily reduced tolerance in strain SC5314, the standard\nlab strain.\nTo determine the generalizability of the effect,\nwe performed similar\nanalyses on a collection of clinical isolates representing the four\nmajor C. albicans clades, which exhibit FLC tolerance\nlevels measured as FoG ranging from <30% to >80%7 (Figure 1C). Notably,\nCOL\ncleared FoG to near-baseline levels, in a manner that correlated with\nthe initial FoG levels (Figure 1C) (FoG levels for FLC vs FLC+COL, with coefficient of determination\n(R2) of 0.92. COL+FLC had a similar effect\nin C. albicans strains reported to be resistant to\nFLC as well as for representative isolates from other pathogenic species\nand for wild isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Figure S1), causing a slight increase\nin RAD/susceptibility and dramatic clearance of FoG/tolerance). Thus,\nCOL appears to affect very different yeast strains in an analogous\nmanner.\n\n## Effect of Colistin on Other Antifungal Drugs\nBecause\nCOL was reported to affect several antifungal drugs, we first tested\nthe degree to which COL enhanced the activity of azole drugs that,\nlike FLC, inhibit sterol biosynthesis. Like with FLC, COL added to\nketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole or miconazole only slightly\nincreased the susceptibility level (2\u20135 mm) (Figure S2) and cleared FoG20 to baseline levels.\nInterestingly, with terbinafine, a drug that inhibits Erg1 catalysis,\nthe first step in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, COL completely\neliminated FoG and increased susceptibility (RAD20) by\n7 mm (Figure S2C). By contrast, we detected\nonly minor effects of COL on the resistance levels of echinocandin\nand polyene classes of antifungal drugs. In addition, there was little\neffect of COL on sphingolipid inhibitors and on 5-fluorocytosine,\nan inhibitor of nucleotide biosynthesis (Figure S3). Thus, colistin appears to have a minor effect on resistance\nto most antifungal agents, and a more dramatic effect on azole tolerance.\n\n## Colistin Acts Synergistically with Antifungal Triazoles\nWe next asked whether the effect of COL on FLC is synergistic or\nadditive, using checkerboard assays.33 The\ntwo drugs were combined in a series of 2-fold dilutions from 0 to\n128 \u03bcg (Figure 2A). In combination with 0.25 \u03bcg/mL FLC, 2 \u03bcg COL was\nsufficient to reduce growth 2-fold and adding 8 \u03bcg/mL COL reduced\ngrowth by 4-fold (Figure 2B). The FICI (fraction inhibitory concentration index) value\nwas 0.31 for 0.125 \u03bcg/mL FLC and 8 \u03bcg/mL COL, which is\nwell within the range of clinically relevant concentrations and indicates\nsynergy (FICI < 0.5).34,35 This FICI value (0.31)\nwas higher than that measured for 0.125 \u03bcg/mL COL used together\nwith 0.39 \u03bcg/mL of echinocandin (caspofungin) in C.\nalbicans (FICI = 0.2629). Similarly,\nfor itraconazole and COL, FICI = 0.28 was measured (Table 1, 0.125 \u03bcg/mL itraconazole, 4 \u03bcg/mL of COL) (Figure S4). Thus, COL is synergistic with different\nantifungal triazoles at levels of both drugs that are clinically achieveable.36,37\n\n## Combination Therapy Using\nColistin with Fluconazole Increased\nCidality\nWe next asked if COL, like other adjuvants that\neliminate tolerance, increases the level of FLC cidality in\nvitro,7 using two approaches.\nFirst, we tested if cells in the zone of inhibition could resume growth\nby replica-plating disk diffusion assay plates to rich medium (YPD)\nwithout either drug (Figure 1D). Cells on plates exposed only to the FLC disk produced\na lawn of cells within, as well as outside, the zone of inhibition,\nconsistent with the static nature of FLC alone. By contrast, the disk\ndiffusion assays plates that had included COL, when replica-plated\nto rich medium, were essentially clear within the zone of inhibition\n(Figure 1D), indicating\nthat the cells treated with inhibitory concentrations of FLC were\nunable to regrow in the absence of the drug and were likely dead.\nSimilar results were seen when COL was added to other inhibitors of\nsterol biosynthesis (Figure S2C). Thus,\nCOL caused the death of cells exposed to azoles and other inhibitors\nof sterol biosynthesis, an essential process.\nSecond, we analyzed\ncells with propidium iodide (PI), a common indicator of cell death:38 Control live cells (no drug) excluded PI, and\ndead cells (killed with ethanol) stained very brightly with the dye.\nBoth live and dead controls were used to set gating thresholds for\nflow cytometric analysis (Figure 2C): live cells had no detectable PI (less than \u223c250\narbitrary units (A.U) of fluorescence). Dead cells stained brightly\nwith PI (>8500 and up to 4.67 \u00d7 105 AU of fluorescence),\nwith 99.2% having PI > 8931 AU.\nThe proportion of cells in\neach category was determined after 24\nh of exposure to combinations of both drugs at concentrations ranging\nfrom 0 to 128 \u03bcg/mL, as in the checkerboard assay (Figure 2A). Consistent with\nresults from the initial checkerboard assay, the number of cells counted\nper 200 \u03bcL reflected the OD600 measurements observed\nin the checkerboard in Figure 2A. The number of dead cells increased when FLC and COL were\ncombined (Figure 2C,\nRed). These data support the idea that COL together with FLC not only\ninhibits cell growth but also increases cell death at inhibitory FLC\nconcentrations (Figure 2C, red).\n\n## Combination of Fluconazole and Colistin Resulted in Enhanced\nSurvival Relative to Fluconazole Monotherapy in \nWe then used the C. albicans\u2013G. mellonella pathosystem to test FLC+COL efficacy in vivo for strains with different tolerance levels. G. mellonella were infected with a dose of C. albicans that gradually killed the larvae over a period of 5 days. Two hours\npost inoculation, larvae were treated with either water (control),\nFLC, COL, or FLC+COL as a single dose (Figure 2D\u2013F). Five day survival of the controls\n(for all three strains) was only 16\u201322%. Survival of larvae\ninfected with the high FoG strain and treated with FLC+COL (78%) was\nsignificantly greater than either drug alone (FLC, 40%; COL, 32% survival).\nBy contrast, adding colistin did not improve survival of the two strains\nwith lower tolerance (56% and 64% survival on FLC+COL vs 68% and 72%\nsurvival on FLC alone). Overall, the tolerance level of the C. albicans strain was relevant, with high FoG (more tolerant)\nstrains having more sensitivity to the drug combination.\n\n## Combining Colistin\nwith Fluconazole Increases Cell Permeability\nto Propidium Iodide\nTo explore the mechanism by which COL\nsynergizes with FLC, we measured the dynamics with which cells died\nin PI, first by microscopy (Figures 3A,B and S6A), and determined\nthe resulting CFU (Figure S6B) and then\nquantitatively by flow cytometry (Figures 3C and S7). As\nexpected, cells not exposed to any drug did not take up PI and had\nbuds of all sizes, while dead cells (killed with ethanol) stained\nbrightly with PI (Figure 3A). Flow cytometric analysis of the PI found that live cells\ncontained <239 AU (Figure 3B) and dead cells had >8931 AU of fluorescence. In general,\ncells exposed to only one of the drugs (FLC or COL) appeared very\nsimilar to untreated live cells (Figure 3A, green arrow), with intact membranes. This\nis consistent with the static nature of FLC and the fact that COL\ndoes not have substantial antifungal activity at clinically relevant\ndrug concentrations.30\nA small proportion of these cells did have discernible,\nbut low\nlevels of PI staining (Figure 3A, right panel, pink arrow), suggesting that they were partially\npermeable to the dye. The cells that stained light pink appeared to\nhave intact membranes based on their DIC refraction, suggesting that,\ndespite taking up low amounts of PI, they were alive. By contrast,\ncultures of cells treated with FLC+COL included live, unstained cells,\nthe light pink \u201cpermeable\u201d cells with low levels of\nPI, as well as many dead cells that stained brightly with PI (Figures 3A, right panel,\nred arrow; Figures 3B and S6A). We do not know if these light\npink cells are able to continue growing over long time periods or\nif they are cells that have begun to become dye-permeable and will\neventually lose membrane integrity.\nAnalysis of PI uptake over\ntime using flow cytometry revealed that\nthe first cells that were permeable or dead appeared after \u223c1\nh and that the proportion of permeable + dead cells increased with\ntime of incubation in the drug combination (Figure 3B). Cells with an intermediate level of PI\nstaining (between 239 and 8931 AU by flow cytometry) appeared to be\nviable, in that they retained normal cell shapes (Figure 3A, pink arrow), appeared intact\nas judged by DIC refraction, and had buds of all sizes, similar to\nthe live cells (green arrow).\nUsing flow cytometry, we quantified\nintracellular PI fluorescence\ndynamics over 3 h after the addition of PI (Figure 3B). As expected, the proportion of dead cells\n(PI staining > 8931 units) increased with increasing amounts of\nthe\ntwo drugs. In all FLC+COL treatments, dead cells first appeared at\n\u223c60 min after adding the two drugs. Notably, the number of\ncells that were partially permeable to PI (239\u20138931 AU) was\nevident in all combinations of FLC+COL concentrations (Figure 3C). Together, these results\nindicate that combining FLC and COL synergistically increases cell\npermeability as well as cell death, two effects rarely seen with either\ndrug alone.\nTo determine whether FLC+COL caused a general effect\non cell permeability,\nwe tested cell permeability in other stains, such as mitotracker green,\nwhich enters cells and stains mitochondrial membranes. The fluorescence\nintensity of intracellular mitotracker green became far brighter in\nthe FLC+COL drug combination (P-value < 0.012)\ncompared to a slight increase in FLC alone (P-value\n< 0.07) relative to no drug or COL only controls (Figure S7), suggesting that its permeability was increased\nin the FLC+COL treated cells. By contrast, no significant change in\nthe intensity of calcofluor white staining of the outer cell wall\n(which does not require membrane permeabilization) was detectable\n(P-value > 0.4\u20130.7, Figure S7), indicating that the change does not affect the ability\nof the cell wall to bind calcofluor. Thus, the FLC+COL combination\nappears to generally affect plasma membrane permeability, allowing\nmore stain, and perhaps more drug, to enter the cells.\nFluorescent\nantifungal drug probes facilitate studies of drug uptake\nand intracellular localization. We established a series of fluorescent\nazole probes,39\u221241 including azole-dansyl and azole-Cy5, both of which\nlocalize primarily to the mitochondria, suggesting that some antifungal\nazole drugs may accumulate in the mitochondria.39 These probes are also useful for measuring net intracellular\nazole concentrations. Because FLC+COL together cause a general increase\nin cell permeability (e.g., permeability to mitotracker\ngreen), we asked if COL also affects the ability of FLC to cross the\ncell membrane. For this, we used azole-Cy5, a fluorescent azole antifungal\nprobe that retains antifungal activity, is readily taken up by cells,\nand can be quantified by flow cytometry.39 Adding COL to azole-Cy5 accelerated the rate of Cy5-azole uptake\nby 2-fold after 30 min of COL addition, relative to the level of the\nprobe uptake in the absence of COL (Figure S5). This implies that the FLC+COL combination causes cells to reach\nhigher intracellular concentrations of the azole, presumably because\nof increased membrane permeability.\n\n## Colistin Synergizes with\nMutants in the Ergosterol Biosynthesis\nPathway\nColistin generally permeabilizes the membranes of\nGram-negative bacteria due to its high LPS affinity and is therefore\nfar less effective for Gram-positive bacteria and eukaryotic membranes.\nFurthermore, COL does not synergize with intracellular drugs such\nas 5-fluorocytosine (Figure S3); thus,\nthe mechanism of synergy with FLC cannot be simply because COL increases\nyeast membrane permeability. However, it was possible that COL has\na secondary effect that simply synergizes with azole antifungals.\nTo test the hypothesis that FLC causes membrane defects that synergize\ndirectly with colistin-mediated membrane permeabilization, we asked\nif C. albicans mutants lacking genes in the yeast\nmembrane ergosterol synthesis pathway42,43 (e.g., ERG2, ERG3, ERG4, ERG5, ERG6, ERG11, and ERG24) are sensitive to COL in the absence\nof FLC (Figure 4A).\nIndeed, colistin reduced\nthe growth of ergosterol biosynthetic\nmutants (erg11, erg3erg11, erg24, and erg2). This suggests that it\nis changes in membrane ergosterol that make cells more sensitive to\ncolistin. Less dramatic effects were evident with mutants encoding\nenzymes further downstream in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.\nFLC resistance and tolerance of the ERG mutants\nwas assessed with disk diffusion assays in the absence or presence\nof COL (Figure S8A). Strains with erg6 or erg11 mutations were resistant\nto FLC and were hypersensitive to COL (no growth at all in the plate).\nOther erg mutants were more susceptible to FLC and\nless sensitive to COL (Figure S8), roughly\nas a function of their distance from erg11 in the\npathway. Similar results were seen when comparing the proportion of\ncells inhibited as a function of COL concentration (Figure 4B) using a population analysis\nprofile assay (Figure 4B). Together, these results indicate that the depletion of ergosterol,\neither through azole treatment or relevant erg mutations,\nincreases the sensitivity of C. albicans cells to\nCOL. In addition, they highlight that the mechanism of FLC+COL synergy\nis not due to increased amounts of intracellular FLC. Rather, reduced\nmembrane ergosterol appears to increase cell vulnerability to COL,\npresumably because of the altered membrane composition.\nTo ask\nif colistin increases cell death in the erg mutants,\nas it does with FLC, we quantified intracellular PI levels\nin the erg mutants using flow cytometry. In the absence\nof drugs, almost all cells were alive and impermeable. In the erg6, erg11, and erg24 mutants, there was a small proportion of permeable cells (up to\n10%) and very small proportions of dead cells (Figure 4C). Importantly, adding COL to these mutants\ngreatly increased the proportion of dead cells (\u223c16\u201360%),\nwith more modest increases in the proportion of permeable cells (\u223c18\u201327%, Figure 4C).\nThe analysis\nof erg mutants provides interesting\ninsights into the role of ERG3. First, while the erg3 mutant grew in the presence of FLC alone, it grew slowly\nin general and, when COL was present, the region near the FLC disk\nwas highly sensitive to COL (Figure S8A). This is reminiscent of the clearance of tolerance by other adjuvants\nin wild-type cells and suggests Erg3 has a more prominent role in\nFLC tolerance than in bona fide resistance.44,45 However, unlike wild-type cells, erg3 mutants remained\nlargely viable in the presence of FLC+COL, while erg11erg3 mutants, like erg11 mutants,\nwere largely killed by COL (Figure 4B and C). This indicates that erg11 is epistatic to erg3 and that erg3 mutations do not rescue the sensitivity to COL conferred by erg11 deletion. Rather, it appears that the sensitivity\nof wild-type cells to FLC+COL is largely a function of ergosterol\ndepletion and is not highly affected by the ability of Erg3 to produce\ntoxic sterol intermediates. Taken together, these results imply that\nCOL not only increases the amount of FLC that enters cells (Figure 3) but also permeabilizes,\nand ultimately kills, cells whose membranes have reduced ergosterol\ncontent (Figure 4).\n\n## Colistin Acts More Rapidly on Fluconazole Pretreated Cells\nFluconazole inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the\nlanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase encoded by ERG11; however, ergosterol depletion requires several hours to slow growth\nand affect cell morphology.46 Since the\ncombination of COL with FLC increased FLC uptake, cell permeabilization,\nand death, and since this is a consequence of ergosterol depletion,\nwe next asked whether the dynamics of colistin\u2019s mechanism\nof action were faster than those of the mechanism of action of FLC.\nWe compared the activity of COL added to fluconazole-pretreated cells\nwith the activity of FLC added to colistin-pretreated cells by measuring\nPI levels over time after the addition of the second drug. Cells were\n16 h in medium with the first drug and then we added medium without\ndrug, with COL or FLC alone, or with both drugs together. PI intensity\nwas measured 5 h after the addition of the second drug.\nAs\nexpected, control cells exposed to no drug or to COL alone were not\npermeable to PI (Figure 5). Adding COL to cells pre-exposed to FLC (Figure 5), or to cells initially treated with FLC+COL\n(Figure 5), reduced\nviability within the first 30 min of treatment (Figure 5). By contrast, when adding FLC to cells\npre-exposed to COL, growth reduction was seen only after \u223c90\nmin (Figure 5). Importantly,\nwhen COL was added to cells initially exposed to FLC, the reduction\nin viability occurred before the first measurement (at 30 min following\nthe addition of COL) (Figure 5). Thus, COL rapidly permeabilizes cells pretreated with FLC\nmore rapidly than it permeabilizes cells when added together with\nFLC. This suggests that COL not only increases FLC entry into cells,\nbut that COL may have a more dramatic effect on viability in cells\ndepleted for ergosterol.\n\n## Colistin Interacts with Membrane Phospholipids\nWhile\nCOL specifically binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Gram-negative\nbacteria, in Gram-positive bacteria, it acts as a positively charged\ndetergent, albeit at much higher concentrations than those required\nto eradicate Gram-negative pathogens.47 To ask if the antifungal activity of COL also is dependent upon\nits peptide charge, we tested three additional membrane-disrupting\nantimicrobials with different net charges for their ability to synergize\nwith FLC (Figure S9). Similar to COL (charge\n+547), RB163, a cationic amphiphile-derived\nfrom the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin48 (compound 3 in ref (48)) synergized with FLC (FICI = 0.28 with 0.125 \u03bcg/mL FLC and\n4 \u03bcg/mL RB163). By contrast, daptomycin (charge \u22123)49 (Figure S9C) did\nnot augment the activity of FLC. These results are consistent with\nthe idea that, as for Gram-positive bacteria, in C. albicans, positive charge may be an important feature required for COL to\ndisrupt ergosterol-depleted membranes.\nCOL binds with high affinity\nto LPS, a lipid absent from eukaryotic membranes.50 To ask if COL nonspecifically binds negatively charged\nmembrane lipids present in yeast membranes, we performed a fluorescence\ndisplacement assay that discriminates between subtle differences in\nthe binding of small molecules to the lipid A of core LPS, as well\nas to other phospholipids (see Methods). Indeed,\nCOL was able to bind to phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidyl-l-serine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, albeit with affinities\n2-fold lower than its affinity for LPS (Figure S10). This supports the idea that COL has the potential to\nbind eukaryotic lipids in the plasma membrane. Altogether, it suggests\nthat COL binds fungal plasma membranes to a greater degree when they\nare depleted of ergosterol, generating increased permeability to antifungal\ndrugs, vital dyes, and other intracellular stains. Thus, we propose\nthat COL, when combined with FLC, acts synergistically and increases\ndrug cidality via the permeabilization of ergosterol-depleted membranes.\n\n## Discussion\nThis study addressed the mechanism by which clinically\nfeasible\nconcentrations of COL, a potent anti-Gram-negative lipopeptide antibiotic,\nenhance the antifungal activity of fluconazole, the most widely used\nantifungal drug. We first confirmed earlier reports29,30 that colistin indeed synergizes with fluconazole against a range\nof C. albicans isolates, as well as against other\nnon-albicans Candida species although the synergy\nwith azoles is weaker than the synergy with echinocandins. Importantly,\nthe effect of colistin on fluconazole tolerance is\nfar more pronounced than that on resistance. Furthermore, the amount\nof colistin required to augment fluconazole and cause cell damage\nand death (2 \u03bcg colistin, Figure 2A and B) is well within the range of colistin concentrations\nused to treat patients with bacterial infections,51,52 a critical distinction from many combination therapies that work in vitro but are not amenable to clinical use because of\nhigh toxicity in mammals. Consistent with this, colistin was particularly\neffective at augmenting the effect of fluconazole on a highly tolerant C. albicans isolate. Colistin also increased cell permeability\nand death in cells depleted for ergosterol, either by azole drugs\nor by mutations affecting critical steps in ergosterol biosynthesis.\nFinally, colistin can bind eukaryotic membrane lipids. We propose\nthat the mechanism by which colistin exerts its antifungal activity\nis likely similar to its activity in Gram-positive bacteria: via membrane\npermeabilization that is dependent upon the highly cationic nature\nof the peptide and the negative charge of membrane. Thus, we posit\nthat colistin binds and disrupts eukaryotic membranes more effectively\nif they are depleted of ergosterol and/or if plasma membrane integrity\nis perturbed.\n\n## Colistin Largely Reduces Fluconazole Tolerance, \nBy directly assaying tolerance\nas well as resistance, the colistin-mediated reduction in fluconazole\nresistance was relatively modest: an average of 0.4 mm increase in\nthe radius of the zone of inhibition, irrespective of the initial\nsusceptibility level of the strain. Nonetheless, fluconazole enables\ncolistin to affect fungal membranes resulting in cell death instead\nof cell arrest, and colistin reduced fluconazole tolerance to approximately\nbasal levels, such that the original FoG level in FLC correlated with\nthe reduction in FoG level in fluconazole plus colistin (R2 = 0.91). This result was seen with diverse C.\nalbicans and non-albicans Candida isolates\nand is similar to what was previously seen with other adjuvant drugs\nwhen combined with fluconazole.7 Based\non a study of patient isolates with high and low tolerance levels,7 fluconazole plus colistin, like other fluconazole-adjuvant\ncombinations, would be most effective for treating infections caused\nby isolates with high fluconazole tolerance. Indeed, the fluconazole\nplus colistin combination increased the survival of G. mellonella infected with high tolerance strains most dramatically. Accordingly,\nthe use of combination approaches that largely affect tolerance would\nrequire that clinical assays measure not only drug resistance, but\nalso tolerance quantitatively, whether by disk assays analyzed by diskImageR or by broth microdilution assays.7,10,11\n\n## Colistin Increases Cell\nPermeability and Cidality of Ergosterol-Depleted\nCells\nAdding colistin to fluconazole increases the proportion\nof dead and PI-permeable cells in a concentration-dependent manner\n(Figure 3C). Furthermore,\nthe fluconazole plus colistin combination is cidal, at drug concentrations\nas low as 0.25 \u03bcg/mL of fluconazole with 2 \u03bcg/mL colistin\n(Figure 2), as determined\nby replica plating (Figure S2) as well\nas PI staining (Figures 2C and 3). Importantly, we found that PI staining\ncould be used to identify permeable, yet viable, cells in addition\nto the classic distinctions made between live (unstained) and dead\n(brightly stained) cells. The interpretation of permeability in the\nlow-to-intermediate level of intracellular PI staining, is based upon\ncell refractivity and morphology, as well as on colony counts that\nsuggest these cells continue to grow and form colonies. Nonetheless,\nwe cannot rule out the possibility that at least some of these cells\nmay be on their way to cell death. Whether they necessarily die or\nare able to recover remains to be determined.\nThe ability of\ncolistin to permeabilize cells is associated with its ability to kill\nthem. This appears to be due, in part, to colistin increasing the\nability of azole probes to enter cells. In addition, in cells pretreated\nwith fluconazole, COL accelerates cell permeability and mortality\nwithin 30 min (Figure 5). Similarly, cells lacking enzymes critical for ergosterol synthesis\ndie when colistin is added (Figure 4) and this occurs via a cell permeabilization that\nappears similar to that seen with fluconazole plus colistin. Consistent\nwith this, in Burkholderia cepacia, disruption of\ngenes that encode enzymes required for the synthesis of hopinoids,\nanalogues of eukaryotic steroids, are far more sensitive to polymyxin\nB.53 Taken together, these results indicate\nthat the azole treated cells are more sensitive to colistin because\nnot only because colistin increases the intracellular fluconazole\nconcentration, but because ergosterol depletion by fluconazole renders\nthe cells more vulnerable to permeabilization by colistin.\nWe\npropose that the synergism of fluconazole with colistin occurs\nthrough a series of steps. First, fluconazole inhibits ergosterol\nbiosynthesis, resulting in the depletion of membrane ergosterol. Second,\nergosterol depletion alters membrane properties, making the membrane\nmore susceptible to colistin-mediated membrane permeabilization, thereby\nincreasing the intracellular concentrations of azoles and other molecules.\nThird, the detergent activity of COL permeabilizes, and thereby kills,\nmore cells. Importantly, these synergistic activities occur in a dose-dependent\nmanner, such that colistin can be used together with fluconazole and\nother azoles at low, clinically feasible, concentrations.\n\n## Conclusion\nColistin synergizes with fluconazole to permeabilize cell membranes,\nwhich leads to higher cidality with drug combinations used at low,\nclinically relevant concentrations. The drug combination is particularly\neffective against isolates that exhibit fluconazole tolerance, both in vivo and in vitro, which is achieved\nby activation of stress response pathways and reduction in intracellular\ndrug concentrations.7 The interaction appears\nto be due to colistin binding plasma membrane lipids and is more effective\nin cells depleted of ergosterol, either pharmacologically (via an\nazole antifungal) or genetically, via mutations in ergosterol biosynthesis.\n\n## Growth\nConditions\nStrains used in this study are listed\nin Table 1. Experiments\nwere conducted with C. albicans standard lab strain\nSC5314, unless noted otherwise. Cells were grown to log phase in liquid\ncasitone (casitone, yeast extract, sodium citrate dehydrate, glucose\nplus 40 mg/L adenine and 80 mg/L uridine; Sigma). Cultures were shaken\nat 30 \u00b0C in 5 mL of YPAD overnight. Drug-exposed cultures were\ndiluted 1:100 for 2\u20133 h in casitone followed by drug addition.\nDrugs were diluted in water (posaconazole (Sigma-Aldrich SML2287,\n>98%), colistin (Glentham Life Sciences GA9867, \u226519\u202f000\nU/mg), amphotericin B (TOKU-E, \u226595%), 5-fluorocytosine (Sigma-Aldrich\nF7129, \u226599%); ethanol (terbinafine T8826, \u226598%), fluconazole\n(Sigma-Aldrich F8929, \u226598%, ketoconazole (Sigma-Aldrich K1003,\n\u226599%), miconazole (Fischer Bioreagents, 98%), clotrimazole\n(Glentham Life Sciences, GA8137), caspofungin diacetate (Sigma-Aldrich\nSML0425, \u226519\u202f000 IU/mg), anidulafungin (Sigma-Aldrich\nSML2288, \u226597%) myriocin (Sigma-Aldrich M1175, \u226598%),\namphotericin B (A2411, \u223c80%), daptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich D2446,\n\u226590%), RB16348 (\u226595%)) or\nDMSO (natamycin, Sigma-Aldrich, \u226595%). Casitone solid media\n(casitone liquid plus 10 g/L agar (Formedium, Ltd.)) was used for\nthe disk assay method. Colistin (GA9867, Glentham Life Sciences, \u226519\u202f000\nU/mg) was added to agar media at a final concentration of 64 \u03bcg/mL.\n\n## Disk Assays\nStrains were streaked from frozen culture\nonto YPAD agar and incubated overnight at 30 \u00b0C. Two to three\ncolonies were picked into 1 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS solution, and optical\ndensity (OD600) was determined with an Infinite M200 PRO\nTecan instrument. OD600 was adjusted to 0.01 (106 cells/mL) through dilution with 1\u00d7 PBS, and 200 \u03bcL of\ndiluted culture from each strain was plated onto 15 mL casitone plates\nand spread using sterile beads (3 mm, Fisher Scientific). After the\nplates had dried, a single 25 \u03bcg drug disk (6 mm diameter, Becton,\nDickinson and Company, USA) was placed in the center of each plate.\nPlates were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 48 h. Analyses of RAD and\nFoG were done by using the diskImageR script.10\n\n## Population Analysis Profiling Assays\nFresh colonies\n(2\u20133) were picked from strains grown overnight on YPAD plates\ninto 1 mL of 10% glycerol in 96-well plates, and cells were diluted\nto 106 cells/mL based on OD600 measurements,\nfollowed by 10-fold dilution series to reach 1000 cells/mL. A volume\nof 10 \u03bcL was spotted to plates containing different concentrations\nof COL or FLC ranging from 0 to 320 \u03bcg/mL. Cells were counted\nmanually, and the number of cells per milliliter was calculated according\nto the dilutions and plotted using R software (ggplot2).\n\n## Checkerboard\nAssays and Growth Curves\nTwo to three\ncolonies of strain SC5314 were picked into 1\u00d7 PBS buffer, OD600 was adjusted to 0.01 (106 cells/mL) with 1\u00d7\nPBS, and cultures were then diluted to 103 cells/mL in\ncasitone media. Drugs were added in a double dilution grid ranging\nfrom 0 to 128 \u03bcg/mL in 96 flat-well plate (BND003C,",
