  "title": "Topical niclosamide (ATx201) reduces Staphylococcus aureus colonization and increases Shannon diversity of the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis patients in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), Staphylococcus aureus frequently colonizes lesions and is hypothesized to be linked to disease severity and progression. Treatments that reduce S. aureus colonization without significantly affecting the skin commensal microbiota are needed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we tested ATx201 (niclosamide), a small molecule, on its efficacy to reduce S. aureus and propensity to evolve resistance in vitro. Various cutaneous formulations were then tested in a superficial skin infection model. Finally, a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial was performed to investigate the impact of ATx201 OINTMENT 2% on S. aureus colonization and skin microbiome composition in patients with mild-to-severe AD (EudraCT:2016-003501-33). ATx201 has a narrow minimal inhibitory concentration distribution (.125-.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) consistent with its mode of action - targeting the proton motive force effectively stopping cell growth. In murine models, ATx201 can effectively treat superficial skin infections of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In a Phase 2 trial in patients with mild-to-severe AD (N = 36), twice-daily treatment with ATx201 OINTMENT 2% effectively reduces S. aureus colonization in quantitative colony forming unit (CFU) analysis (primary endpoint: 94.4% active vs. 38.9% vehicle success rate, p = .0016) and increases the Shannon diversity of the skin microbiome at day 7 significantly compared to vehicle. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ATx201 could become a new treatment modality as a decolonizing agent.",

  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a prevalence of 2%\u201310% in adults in developed countries.\n1\n AD is a multifactorial disease with a complex interplay of immunological mechanisms, predominantly Th2/Th22 immune responses, and an altered epidermal skin barrier, characterized by trans\u2010epidermal water loss and epidermal hyperplasia.\n2\n, \n3\n Patients with AD are prone to bacterial colonization by Staphylococcus aureus on both lesional and non\u2010lesional skin.\n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n Indeed, more than 90% of patients with AD are colonized with S. aureus and the density of S. aureus on acutely inflamed AD lesions is generally more than 1000\u2010fold higher than on non\u2010lesional AD skin and peaks during disease flares.\n5\n, \n7\n The greater S. aureus colonization and proliferation probably results from a combination of a compromised functional epidermal barrier with reduced lipid content, increased adherence potential because of augmented fibronectin and fibrinogen in the stratum corneum, diminished immune recognition and impaired antimicrobial peptide production in patients with AD.\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\nIn turn, S. aureus colonization is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of AD that exacerbates the disorder.\n5\n, \n11\n\nS. aureus secretes toxins that act as super\u2010antigens and exogenous protease inhibitors that further damage the epidermal barrier and potentiate allergen penetration that trigger multiple inflammatory reactions even in the absence of overt infection.\n11\n\nS. aureus enterotoxins provoke the generation of enterotoxin\u2010specific IgE and thereby increase inflammation in AD.\n13\n These enterotoxins interact directly with MHC II and the beta chain of the T\u2010cell receptor to induce an antigen\u2010independent proliferation of majorly type 2 T cells.\n13\n Secretion of alpha toxin, a destructive pore\u2010forming toxin often found in the lesions of patients with severe AD, is primarily associated with keratinocyte death, which in turn correlates to increased exposure to Th2 cytokines.\n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n Expression of delta toxin by S. aureus, a phenol\u2010soluble modulin peptide, has been described to cause lysis\u2010independent mast cell degranulation and was also found in lesions of AD patients.\n6\n, \n9\nIn recent studies, it was hypothesized that S. aureus relative abundance was further linked to the skin microbiome dysbiosis in patients with AD as shifts in microbial diversity and load of Staphylococcus were correlated to specific AD disease states and disease progression.\n7\n The abundance of Staphylococci, specifically S. aureus, was shown to be greater and the Shannon diversity lower during disease flare compared to baseline or post\u2010treatment/resolving flares.\n7\n Thus, S. aureus and the skin microbiome represent a promising target for the treatment of AD by addressing the \u2019outside\u2010in\u2019 mechanism of the disease, although the causality of S. aureus decolonization and AD outcomes remains to be elucidated.\n2\n Indeed, antibiotics such as fusidic acid or mupirocin are commonly prescribed to AD patients to address the microbial component of the disease. Unfortunately, these antibiotics exhibit major drawbacks. Worldwide resistance rates of S. aureus towards fusidic acid and mupirocin range in AD patients from 2.6% to 41% and 4% to 41%, respectively, and resistance towards fusidic acid evolves rapidly during treatment.\n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n, \n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\nTo exploit recent insights regarding the importance of S. aureus in AD, microbiome therapies are emerging to the clinic with the objective to reduce the abundance of S. aureus and increase microbial diversity by introducing one or more beneficial commensal strains. It was reported that transplantation of Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains reduced the bacterial load of S. aureus on the skin of AD patients, through exerting antimicrobial activity towards S. aureus.\n31\n Another study demonstrated that Bacillus subtilis lipopeptides eliminate S. aureus by inhibiting its quorum\u2010sensing ability.\n32\n The presence of Esp\u2010secreting S. epidermidis was also shown to eliminate the nasal colonization of S. aureus by diminishing the biofilm formation of S. aureus.\n33\n Although therapies based on addition of living bacteria represent a promising therapeutic approach, challenges include the affordable manufacturing, formulation and long\u2010term stability of such therapeutics. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether the use of transplants of specific commensal bacteria can eliminate resistant strains on the human AD skin, such as methicillin\u2010resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Thus, a small molecule with a narrow\u2010spectrum effect, including S. aureus, could represent an attractive alternative for the treatment of AD.\nWe have repurposed niclosamide, a marketed oral chewable tablet to treat tapeworm infections, towards a topical decolonizing agent against S. aureus. Previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial effect of niclosamide against S. aureus and MRSA in vitro.\n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n A study of Gwisai et\u00a0al. found that niclosamide inhibits a maturation of S. aureus biofilm, which was further validated by Torres et\u00a0al., and niclosamide\u2010coated surfaces exhibited potent anti\u2010S. aureus activity.\n34\n, \n35\n Rajamuthiah et\u00a0al. demonstrated that niclosamide exerts bacteriostatic killing kinetics and is effective against several drug\u2010resistant clinical strains, including MRSA, vancomycin\u2010resistant, linezolid\u2010resistant and daptomycin\u2010resistant strains.\n36\nIn this study, we examined the potency and the spectrum of ATx201 (niclosamide) in preclinical models and further analysed its propensity for resistance evolution. The impact of ATx201 OINTMENT 2% on the skin microbiome and load of S. aureus was then assessed in a clinical trial in patients with mild\u2010to\u2010severe AD.\n\n## Bacterial strains and reagents\nThe clinical strains MRSA 43484 and 88779 were isolated from patients with skin abscesses and were obtained from UNION therapeutics A/S. The laboratory strains of S. aureus used in this study (ATCC 29213, ATCC 25293, NCTC 8325, and JE2) were obtained from the Department of Veterinary Disease Biology at the University of Copenhagen. S. aureus RN4220 and its mutator derivative RN4220 \u0394mutS were kindly provided by A. J. O'Neill (University of Leeds, UK).\nAll strains were cryopreserved in Brain Heart Infusion broth supplemented with glycerol 15% (v/v) at \u221280\u00b0C and cultivated aerobically at 37\u00b0C in nutrient agar base no. 2 supplemented with calf blood 5% (v/v) (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). All bacterial cultures were grown in Mueller\u2013Hinton broth (MHB) (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). When appropriate, culture medium was supplemented with ATx201 (Niclosamide; CAS: 50\u201065\u20107), rifampicin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin (Sigma\u2010Aldrich) and the pH adjusted to different values with NaOH and HCl solutions of different concentrations (.1, 1, 2 and 5\u00a0M).\n\n## Susceptibility analysis of ATx201 and comparators\nMinimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the broth microdilution method according to the recommendations of The Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute.\n38\n\n## Time\u2010kill kinetics of ATx201\nFor the time\u2010kill kinetics of ATx201, overnight cultures of strains MRSA 43484 and RN4220 were diluted in MHB to an OD600 = .1 and \u223c1.25 \u00d7 106 cells from these starter cultures were inoculated into flasks containing 25\u00a0ml of MHB (\u223c5 \u00d7 104\u00a0CFU/ml) with different concentrations of ATx201 (drug\u2010free, 1 \u00d7 MIC, 1.5 \u00d7 MIC and 4 \u00d7 MIC). The flasks were then incubated at 37\u00b0C, and colony forming unit (CFU) counts were performed at time points 0, 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h by spotting three 10\u2010\u03bcl drops of the diluted cultures on blood agar (BA) plates. All BA plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and colonies were counted 24\u00a0h later. Data were obtained in two independent experiments.\n\n## Bacterial growth inhibition study\nMHB overnight culture of ATCC 29213 was sub\u2010cultured in fresh broth and grown up to OD600 = .3. Afterwards, freshly grown cells were distributed to separate tubes and treated with 1 \u00d7, 4 \u00d7 or 10 \u00d7 MIC of ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, erythromycin, vancomycin and ATx201. Untreated control was also included. Cells were further grown at 37\u00b0C and optical density was recorded at 1\u2010h intervals at 600\u00a0nm and plotted against time.\n\n## Molecule biosynthesis rate determination assay\nMacromolecule biosynthesis experiments were performed as described by Ling et\u00a0al.\n39\n Briefly, S. aureus ATCC 29213 overnight culture was sub\u2010cultured at 1:100 in minimal media (.02\u2010M HEPES, .002\u2010M MgSO4, .0001\u2010M CaCl2, .4% succinic acid, .043\u2010M NaCl2, .5% (NH4)2SO4) supplemented with 5% tryptic soy broth and grown to OD600 = .2. Cells were pelleted down by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh media followed by incubation for 15\u00a0min (for cell wall synthesis 30\u00a0min) with negative control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ATx201, carbonyl cyanide m\u2010chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or positive control of DNA, RNA, protein or cell\u2010wall synthesis inhibitors ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, erythromycin and vancomycin, respectively. The MICs of S. aureus ATCC 29213 for ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, erythromycin and vancomycin were found to be .25, .003, .5 and 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. After incubation, cells were pulse labelled individually by radiolabeled DNA, RNA, protein and cell\u2010wall synthesis precursors (50\u00a0\u03bcCi) 3H\u2010thymidine, (5\u00a0\u03bcCi) 3H\u2010uridine, (50\u00a0\u03bcCi) 3H\u2010leucine and (5\u00a0\u03bcCi) 3H\u2010glucosamine hydrochloride per ml, respectively, for 20\u00a0min (for cell\u2010wall synthesis cells 10\u00a0min). Finally, samples were precipitated with an equal volume of cold 30% TCA. Precipitates were membrane filtered and subsequently washed twice with cold 15% TCA and twice with water. Filters were air dried and stored in 10\u2010ml scintillation vials. Finally, 3\u2010ml scintillation fluid was added to each vial and a 3H count was taken in a Beckman Coulter LS6500 liquid scintillation counter for 1\u00a0min. Radioactive count of control (DMSO) treated sample was considered 100% precursor incorporation in macromolecule synthesis. Accordingly, the percentage rate of other treated samples was calculated. Data were obtained in two independent experiments.\n\n## DiSC3(5) fluorescence\u2010based membrane potential study\nMHB overnight cultures of ATCC 29213 and MRSA 43484 were sub\u2010cultured 1:100 in fresh MHB media and grown to OD600 = .2. Grown cells were diluted to OD600 = .1 in MHB and subsequently labelled with 1\u00a0\u03bcM 3,3\u2032\u2010dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)). The fluorescence spectra of labelled cells were taken in a microplate reader (Synergy H1, Holm & Halby) at Ex/Em wavelengths 622/670\u00a0nm over time. After reading of initial stable DiSC3(5) spectra, labelled cells were treated with DMSO, ATx201, CCCP, Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Rifampicin or Erythromycin and change of DiSC3(5) fluorescence was recorded over time.\n\n## Cytoplasmic pH change measurement\nMHB overnight culture of ATCC 29213 was sub\u2010cultured 1:100 in fresh media and grown to OD600 = .2 and subsequently incubated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of 2\u2032,7\u2032\u2010bis(2\u2010carboxyethyl)\u20105(6)\u2010carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF\u2010AM), a pH sensitive cytoplasmic specific dye, for 30\u00a0min at 30\u00b0C. Incubated cells were pelleted down by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate buffer saline (1.37\u2010M NaCl, 27\u2010mM KCl, 100\u2010mM Na2HPO4, 18\u2010mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 25\u2010mM glucose. Subsequently the cells were adjusted to OD600 = .2. The cell suspension was kept at room temperature for 1\u00a0h to equilibrate the cytoplasmic pH. BCECF fluorescence of labelled cells was recorded in a PerkinElmer LS50B fluorescence spectrometer at Ex/Em wavelengths 485/520\u00a0nm using the time drive application of FLWINLAB software. After initial stable reading of BCECF spectra, labelled cells were treated with DMSO, ATx201, nigericin and CCCP individually. The changes of BCECF fluorescence upon treatments (FU 2.8\u00a0min \u2013 FU .2\u00a0min) were plotted. Data were obtained in two independent experiments.\n\n## Estimation of spontaneous mutation rates\nA fluctuation analysis was adapted from Rosche et\u00a0al. and Gerrish et\u00a0al.\n40\n, \n41\n Approximately 2.5 \u00d7 104 cells from late\u2010exponential phase cultures were inoculated into 250\u00a0ml of MHB (102\u00a0CFU/ml) and distributed into 24 tubes containing 10\u00a0ml of MHB with \u223c103 cells each. These were incubated at 37\u00b0C with agitation (125\u00a0rpm) and grown to late stationary phase. After incubation, \u223c109 cells were spread onto Mueller Hinton agar plates containing .25, .375 and 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of ATx201 by centrifuging 1\u00a0ml of culture for 3\u00a0min at 5000\u00a0rpm, partially discarding the supernatant and resuspending the pellet in the remaining media. The rate of mutational resistance to rifampicin was determined as a control, whereas the rates of mutational resistance to fusidic acid, mupirocin and retapamulin were determined for comparison purposes (\u223c108 cells). The number of resistant colonies was counted after 48\u00a0h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. The average final number of cells (Nf) was obtained from four random cultures by spotting triplicate 10\u00a0\u03bcl\u2010drops of 1:10 serial dilutions in BA. The most likely number of mutations per culture (m) that gave rise to the distribution of mutants observed in the parallel cultures was estimated with a maximum likelihood method using the recursive formula implemented by Gerrish et\u00a0al.\n41\n The mutation rate (\u03bc) (number of mutations per cell per division) was then calculated by dividing m by Nf. The mutation rate estimates represent the mean value of two independent experiments. The frequency of mutants (F) was obtained by multiplying the average number of colonies from the 24 cultures by the volume factor and dividing the resulting value by the Nf. Strains RN4220 and RN4220 \u0394mutS were used to validate the fluctuation assay.\n\n## Susceptibility testing after 40\u2010day passage\nThe in vitro development of resistance to ATx201 were carried out by subjecting MRSA 16115, isolated from dog otitis in Poland and 38127, isolated from hospital in France (QC strain: ATCC 29213) in liquid broths to serial passages to sub\u2010inhibitory concentrations of ATx201 (1/4 MIC) for 40 passages. After every 10 passages, the MIC of ATx201 was determined. The MICs were realized by broth dilution according to EUCAST guidelines.\n\n## Mouse studies\nAll studies comprising animals were conducted in accordance with the National Committee of Animal Ethics.\n\n## Bacterial strains and mice\nStrains MRSA 43484, MRSA 88779 and MRSA 86446, obtained from Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark and representing different resistance and genomic backgrounds, were selected to inoculate the mice. Bacterial suspensions for inoculation of mice were prepared from overnight cultures on 5% BA plates immediately before inoculation by suspending colonies in sterile .9% saline to 9 log10 CFU/ml. Female BALB/c mice, 10\u201312 weeks old (Taconic, Ejby, Denmark) were housed at Statens Serum Institut. All animal experiments were approved by the National Committee of Animal Ethics, Denmark. License No. 2013\u201015\u20102935\u201000900.\n\n## Experimental skin wound infection model\nThe experiments were conducted essentially as described by Vingsbo et\u00a0al.\n42\n Female BALB/c mice, 10\u201312 weeks old (Taconic, Ejby, Denmark), were anaesthetized and shaved on a 2\u20133\u2010cm\n2\n skin area of the lower back. A disposable 7\u2010mm dermal curette (Integra, York, PA, USA) was used to induce a minor superficial skin wound on a 1\u2010cm\n2\n area, which was inoculated with \u223c7 log10 CFU of bacteria. Four days after inoculation and treatment, the mice were sacrificed and the entire infected skin area with underlying tissue was cut out and homogenized in 1\u00a0ml of saline using gentleMACS\u2122 C\u2010tubes (Miltenyi Biotec, Lund, Sweden) on a Dispomix\u00ae Drive (Medic Tools AG, Zug, Switzerland) running at 4000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0s. Tissue homogenates were serially diluted 10\u2010fold in saline containing .1% Triton X\u2010100 (T\u20108787; Sigma\u2010Aldrich Inc., St Louis, MO, USA). Then, 20\u2010\u03bcl spots were applied in duplicate to NaCl agar supplemented with polymyxin B (SSI Diagnostica). In addition, 100\u00a0\u03bcl of the 10\u22122 dilution was spread on a separate plate to increase sensitivity and minimize the risk of a false negative due to carry over of high drug concentrations from the wound. Plates were incubated at 35\u00b0C in ambient air for 20\u201348\u00a0h.\n\n## Formulation preparation of ATx201 for animal studies\nThe ATx201 formulations used for the skin wound infection model were prepared at UNION therapeutics A/S. The comparators used were a Fucidin\u00ae and Bactroban\u00ae. Fucidin\u00ae is a commercial product registered in Denmark: (Fusidic acid 2%; LEO Pharma A/S, Ballerup, Denmark). Bactroban\u00ae is the commercial product registered in Denmark (Bactroban\u00ae nasal 2%, GSK).\n\n## Treatment of skin infection\nMice were treated twice\u2010daily at approximately 24, 30, 48, 54, 72 and 78\u00a0h after inoculation by applying topically .05\u00a0ml of the ATx201 formulation or the comparators to the lesion area. Skin samples were collected the day after completed treatment for CFU determination. Carry\u2010over effects were minimized by performing the CFU determinations >18\u00a0h after the last treatment and homogenizing, diluting and plating the samples immediately.\n\n## Trial design\nThis Phase 2, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo\u2010controlled single\u2010centre trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ATx201 OINTMENT 2% (drug substance: niclosamide) as a cutaneous decolonizing agent in AD patients versus vehicle (DECOLAD Part 2 EudraCT 2016\u2010003501\u201033, NCT03009734). The study was performed from December 2016 until March 2018 in the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the Medical University of Vienna and was conducted according to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and its current amendments, and the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The study was approved by the ethics commission of the Medical University of Vienna. The trial results are reported according to the CONSORT guideline (Table S1).\n\n## Participants\nThe study was composed of male and female subjects between 18 and 70 years of age with signed and dated informed consent obtained and diagnosed with AD (according to the Hanifin and Rajka criteria\n43\n) presenting as localized disease with three lesions. Further, patients with two individual lesions each covering an area between 10 and 200\u00a0cm\n2\n, having a lesional investigator's global assessment (lesional IGA) score between 1 and 4 and colonized by S. aureus with at least 1000\u00a0CFU/cm2, and a third localized lesion of area between 10 and 200\u00a0cm\n2\n with a lesional IGA score between 1 and 4 were included. The full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table S2. The flow of participants is displayed in Figure\u00a01.\n\n## Interventions\nThe study consisted of a screening visit, a 7\u2010day treatment period, and an end\u2010of\u2010study visit on day 14. Patients with AD and colonized by S. aureus were treated once or twice\u2010daily on two defined treatment areas between 10 and 200\u00a0cm\n2\n using either ATx201 OINTMENT 2% (active: niclosamide) or a matching vehicle (split\u2010body design). ATx201 OINTMENT 2% had to be dosed with a thin layer covering the entire lesion as instructed by the clinical personnel at the randomization visit. Only the first treatment application was performed by the investigator, the remaining applications were done by the patients. The visit and assessment schedule can be found in Table S3.\n\n## Outcome\nThe primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of ATx201 OINTMENT 2% in patients with AD and to assess efficacy of ATx201 OINTMENT 2% in eradicating S. aureus compared to vehicle after 7 days of treatment. Treatment success as primary efficacy criteria was defined as a 100\u2010fold reduction in the S. aureus CFU/cm2 of skin lesions after 7 days of treatment. The secondary efficacy criterium was defined as the relative decrease of S. aureus CFU/cm2 on treated skin after 7 days treatment of the ATx201 OINTMENT 2% group, compared to vehicle and untreated area. The secondary objective of the study was to assess the impact of ATx201 OINTMENT 2% on the treated AD lesion and the systemic exposure of ATx201. To assess the AD lesions, the lesional IGA score, a modified eczema area and severity index (EASI) score, and lesional visual analogue scale (VAS) pruritus score, focused only on the target lesion, were utilized for area assessment.\nThe modified EASI assesses the target lesion by evaluating the four signs of eczema\n44\n: redness (erythema, inflammation); thickness (induration, papulation, swelling \u2013 acute eczema); scratching (excoriation); lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules \u2013 chronic eczema). The intensity of each sign is graded using a 4\u2010point scale (0 = absence; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The modified EASI score is the sum of the intensity scores for each sign (0\u201312 points).\nThe lesional IGA score was defined as 0: clear (no inflammatory signs); 1: almost clear (just perceptible erythema, just perceptible papulation/infiltration); 2: mild disease (mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration); 3: moderate disease (moderate erythema, moderate papulation/infiltration); 4: severe disease (severe erythema, severe population/infiltration).\nAll safety data were listed for subjects (patients) in the safety population. An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward adverse change from the subject's baseline condition, that is, any unfavourable and unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease which is considered to be clinically relevant by the physician that occurs during the course of the study, whether or not considered related to the study drug. The definitions used to grade the relationship of an AE to the study drug are displayed in Table S4.\n\n## Randomization and masking\nFor each patient, two treatment areas were selected for treatment (ATx201 OINTMENT 2% or vehicle), and patients were randomized to receive active left and vehicle right or vice versa (split\u2010body design). A third (untreated) lesion was selected. An additional grouping factor was once\u2010daily versus twice\u2010daily application. If possible, target lesions were to be chosen symmetrically on the left and on the right side of the body, respectively. However, if there were no target lesions on both sides of the body, the investigator could choose two target lesions on the same side of the body. The randomization list was generated and maintained by an external vendor according to the study design. Once generated, the randomization code was final and not modifiable. Sealed envelopes (Code Break Envelope) contained treatment assignments. Patients were randomized according to a list with the respective IP number for the patient. Each patient was assigned a number corresponding to the order of entering the study and thus was assigned to the treatment group according to a block randomization schedule. All personnel involved in the study, including the investigators, site personnel, and the sponsor's staff (e.g. CRA/Monitor), were blinded to the IP codes. The treatments were blinded to both patients and physicians. The placebo formulation of the placebo product was identical to the active formulations in terms of looks and feel.\n\n## Sample collection\nSkin swabs were obtained at screening visit (up to five lesions), Baseline (day 1) and end\u2010of\u2010treatment (EOT) (day 7) for quantitative culture of S. aureus using a sterile cotton swab dipped into a buffer of .1% Triton X\u2010100 in .075\u2010M phosphate buffer, pH 7.9. A template of 6.4\u00a0cm\n2\n was streaked with a cotton swab for 10\u00a0s and solubilized in 1\u2010ml buffer. This sample collection procedure has been shown to maximize the recovery of S. aureus from skin of AD patients.\n45\n One part of the buffer was used for a quantitative culture of S. aureus and the other part for quantification of microbiome diversity.\n\n## Quantitative culture of \nAll collected liquid samples were submitted and processed immediately. The swap buffer solution was vortexed mildly to release bacteria. Samples of the skin swab solution were serially diluted and streaked on ChromID agar plates. After incubation at 37\u00b0C over 24\u00a0h the S. aureus specific colonies were counted and the amount of bacterial load was described as CFU per cm2 of the investigated AD skin area. The cut\u2010off value for definition of colonization of lesions with S. aureus was defined as 1000\u00a0CFU/cm2.\n\n## Quantification of skin microbiome diversity\nSkin samples obtained at Baseline and EOT were further used for the quantification of skin microbiome diversity (\u03b1\u2010 and \u03b2\u2010diversity) by 16S rDNA sequencing using an established methodology.\n7\n The \u03b1\u2010diversity of the samples was assessed by counting the number of OTUs (operational taxonomical units, similar to species richness) and calculating the Shannon index.\nTo measure the \u03b2\u2010diversity, we used generalized UniFrac\n46\n which is an intermediate between weighted and unweighted UniFrac (\u03b1 = .5). A detailed description can be found in the supplementary material.\n\n## Pharmacokinetic analysis\nBlood samples were drawn 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8\u00a0h after treatment. Niclosamide concentration in human EDTA plasma (K2EDTA) samples were analysed by LC\u2013MS/MS. Individual and descriptive statistics of systemic exposure of ATx201 OINTMENT 2% concentration\u2010time data were conducted by noncompartmental model of Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.3 or higher (Pharsight Corporation, St. Louis, MO). An analysis of covariance was performed by using SAS PROC GLM.\n\n## In vivo model\nCFU data was log10 transformed prior to analysis. Samples that were CFU negative (i.e. below the lower detection limit of 50\u00a0CFU) were assigned a CFU value of 50. ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparison tests were used to compare log10 CFU values for multiple groups. p\u2010Values <.05 were considered significant. All statistical comparisons were made using the software GraphPad Prism 6.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, CA, USA.\n\n## Phase 2 study\nA formal sample size calculation was not performed and the sample size of 40 patients was regarded as sufficient to get preliminary information about safety and tolerability of the IP in different regimens. A treatment success of 70%\u201390% for ATx201 OINTMENT 2% and 10%\u201315% for vehicle was estimated. With \u2018worst case\u2019 assumptions, 18 patients per group were needed for a statistically significant difference of p <.025 in favour to ATx201 OINTMENT 2% with a power of 80%. Assuming a drop\u2010out rate of 10%, 20 patients per group (in total 40 patients) were needed to keep a global alpha of .05.\nStatistical tests regarding the primary endpoint of the study were performed using a chi\u2010square test for dependent samples in SAS\u00ae Version 9.2 (Test of Symmetry according to Bowker). To keep a global alpha of .05 (two\u2010sided), each of the two hypotheses was tested at a significance level of \u03b1 = .025, two\u2010sided. Secondary efficacy variables were presented using appropriate descriptive methods.\nStatistical test for change in S. aureus abundance level (CFU) was performed using Wilcoxon test. Statistical tests regarding the microbiome analysis were performed using Wilcoxon test. Notwithstanding, statistical tests are defined in Section\u00a03. Statistical tests were made using R (version 3.3 or greater).\n\n## Role of funding sources\nThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n## ATx201 is a potent agent against \nATx201 was identified in a previous high\u2010throughput screen as a compound with activity against MRSA USA300.\n36\n, \n47\n To assess the breadth of effect of ATx201 against a broad panel of clinical isolates, 206 clinically relevant S. aureus strains, including both MRSA (N = 118) and methicillin\u2010sensitive (N = 88) strains, were screened. The panel included strains resistant to commercialized comparators commonly used for the topical treatment of skin infections, such as fusidic acid (N = 60), mupirocin (N = 3), retapamulin (N = 1) and clindamycin (N = 13). The MIC of ATx201 ranged from .125 to .5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml against all S. aureus strains regardless of their resistance towards the comparators (Figure\u00a02A and Table S5). The remarkable consistency in the MIC against diverse isolates of S. aureus suggests that growth might be inhibited through a novel mechanism of action.\nTo test whether ATx201 has a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect, time\u2010kill curves against both methicillin\u2010resistant (MRSA 43484 = MRSA 01) and susceptible (RN422) strains of S. aureus were determined. ATx201 MICs were estimated after 18\u00a0h of incubation and were identical for both strains (Table S5). ATx201 exhibited bacteriostatic killing kinetics at 1 \u00d7 and 1.5 \u00d7 MIC, corresponding to .25 and .375\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively. However, at 4 \u00d7 MIC (1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) ATx201 cleared the bacterial populations of RN422 and MRSA 43484 after 48 and 72\u00a0h, respectively (Figure\u00a02B).\n\n## ATx201 arrests cell growth and inhibits specific biosynthetic pathways\nTo evaluate the kinetics of ATx201, the bacterial growth inhibition of exponentially growing cultures of S. aureus ATCC 29213 was treated with 1 \u00d7, 4 \u00d7 or 10 \u00d7 MIC of ATx201 or known standard DNA, RNA, protein and cell\u2010wall synthesis inhibitors ciprofloxacin, rifampicin, erythromycin and vancomycin, respectively. Optical density at 600\u00a0nm was quantified over time for these different drug exposures. Immediate growth arrest was observed upon an addition of 1 \u00d7 MIC ATx201 (Figure S1). In contrast, none of the comparators arrested cell growth immediately at 1 \u00d7 MIC. Cell growth inhibition by 1 \u00d7 to 10 \u00d7 MIC ATx201 did not cause cell lysis (data not shown).\nTo further investigate the mechanism of action, the effect of ATx201 on macromolecular biosynthetic activity was characterized.
