  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Drug-resistant respiratory pathogens in COPD patients pose a major therapeutic challenge. Colistin is a last-resort treatment for drug-resistant infections. But emerging resistance and hepatorenal toxicity limit its use, which highlights the need for combination strategies to improve its efficacy and safety. This study investigated the antibacterial effect of the combination of benzbromarone and colistin against drug-resistant pathogens associated with COPD. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, MIC determination experiments revealed that respiratory pathogens from COPD patients exhibited high resistance rates to several conventional antibiotics. Furthermore, the checkerboard assay showed that benzbromarone alone had no antibacterial effect but markedly lowered the MIC of colistin, with all FICI values <0.5. Further growth curve and time kill curve analysis showed that colistin combination with benzbromarone significantly enhanced bacterial growth inhibition and exerted bactericidal activity. Additionally, the antibacterial mechanism showed that colistin combined with benzbromarone synergistically enhanced bacterial membrane damage, promoted ROS accumulation, and inhibited ATP production, thereby exerting stronger bactericidal effects. Moreover, validation using the Galleria mellonella larval infection model demonstrated that the benzbromarone-colistin combination provided effective protection against infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, with larval survival rates reaching up to 70%, which was significantly higher than that observed with monotherapy. DISCUSSION: This study revealed that benzbromarone enhanced the antibacterial activity of colistin against COPD-associated drug-resistant pathogens, exhibiting a significant synergistic effect while effectively reducing the required colistin dosage. These findings provide a promising alternative approach for antimicrobial therapy in drug-resistant COPD infections and contribute to the exploration of new antibacterial applications for non-antibiotic drugs.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory pulmonary disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation and typically caused by prolonged smoking or exposure to harmful gases or particulate matter (1). According to the Global Burden of Disease study, COPD has become one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with its prevalence increasing annually (2). The pathophysiological characteristics of COPD include chronic airway inflammation and airway remodeling, involving the regulation of various cytokines and inflammatory mediators (3). The persistent inflammatory state weakens the airway defense mechanisms, leading to immune system dysfunction and rendering COPD patients more susceptible to infections by various pathogens, particularly bacterial respiratory infections (4). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Bacterial infections, especially those affecting the lower respiratory tract, are among the primary triggers of acute exacerbations in COPD patients (5). These infections not only worsen the disease condition but also contribute to increased hospitalization rates and mortality. Consequently, the impact of bacterial infections on COPD has become a critical focus of research. Among COPD patients, Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) are commonly identified pathogens (6, 7). These Gram-negative bacteria employ multiple pathogenic mechanisms, including extracellular polysaccharides, endotoxins, and secreted proteases, to invade pulmonary tissue and exacerbate local inflammatory responses (8). In particular, P. aeruginosa poses a significant clinical challenge due to its robust biofilm formation capacity and high antibiotic resistance, often leading to refractory pulmonary infections (9). This bacterium not only directly induces pulmonary infections but also exacerbates airway inflammation in COPD through immune evasion mechanisms, further accelerating the deterioration of lung function (10). Studies have demonstrated that the presence of Gram-negative bacteria is closely associated with acute exacerbations of COPD, and their increasing antimicrobial resistance presents significant challenges for clinical management (11, 12). Therefore, the development of more effective therapeutic strategies targeting respiratory drug-resistant infections is of paramount importance.\nThe pharmacological treatment of COPD primarily relies on bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and other adjunctive medications (13). However, in cases of bacterial infections, antibiotic therapy becomes crucial. Commonly used antibiotics include broad-spectrum agents such as \u03b2-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides, which are generally effective against common COPD-associated pathogens (14, 15). However, with the widespread and prolonged use of antibiotics, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become a significant challenge in clinical treatment. Bacterial resistance, particularly to commonly used antibiotics, has evolved into a major global public health concern (16). COPD patients, who often receive prolonged antibiotic therapy during hospitalization, are at an increased risk of exposure to multidrug-resistant bacteria, particularly Gram-negative pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae (17, 18). Resistant pathogens such as P. aeruginosa not only exhibit intrinsic resistance to conventional antibiotics but also enhance their resistance through the production of \u03b2-lactamases, aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and other resistance mechanisms (19\u201322). The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria significantly reduces the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment in COPD patients, exacerbates infections, and accelerates disease progression, posing substantial challenges to clinical management. Currently, combination therapy strategies have gained considerable attention, as the concurrent use of conventional antibiotics with adjuvant compounds that possess antimicrobial activity may enhance antibacterial efficacy and mitigate the development of resistance (23, 24). Therefore, focusing on the efficacy, specificity, safety, and clinical feasibility of combination therapeutic strategies holds great promise for providing more effective treatment options for bacterial infections.\nBenzbromarone is a drug primarily used for the treatment of gout. As a potent uricosuric agent, it lowers serum uric acid levels by inhibiting urate reabsorption (25, 26). In recent years, benzbromarone has garnered significant research interest due to its potential in the field of antimicrobial therapy (27, 28). Studies have demonstrated that benzbromarone exhibited notable inhibitory activity against certain Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus species, by altering bacterial cell membrane stability (29). In our study, we further investigated the synergistic effects of benzbromarone in combination with colistin against COPD-associated respiratory pathogens, particularly multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria. COPD patients frequently suffer from infections caused by MDR Gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii, which significantly compromise the effectiveness of conventional antibiotic treatments. Colistin, a last-resort antibiotic with potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria, has regained clinical attention in recent years due to its efficacy against drug-resistant pathogens. However, monotherapy with colistin poses challenges such as the emergence of bacterial resistance and potential toxic side effects. Therefore, our research explored the combination of benzbromarone and colistin to assess their synergistic effects against COPD-related respiratory pathogens. This work provided new ideas and strategies for the development of therapies targeting respiratory infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n## Antibiotic resistance of COPD-associated respiratory pathogens\nBefore evaluating the antibacterial effects of benzbromarone in combination with colistin against COPD-associated respiratory pathogens, it is essential to first determine the susceptibility of these pathogens to benzbromarone alone and other commonly used antibiotics. To achieve this, we randomly selected and tested laboratory-isolated and preserved COPD-associated bacterial strains for their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), assessing their resistance profiles against benzbromarone and clinically relevant antibiotics. The results demonstrated that benzbromarone exhibited varying MIC values against Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, with MICs ranging from 2 to 8\u202f\u03bcg/mL (Table 1). In contrast, Gram-negative pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii exhibited MIC values exceeding 128\u202f\u03bcg/mL, indicating a high level of resistance to benzbromarone (Table 1). Most Gram-positive strains displayed sensitivity to levofloxacin (MIC range: 0.5\u201316\u202f\u03bcg/mL), whereas they exhibited higher MIC values for penicillin (4\u201332\u202f\u03bcg/mL) (Table 1). Some isolates also demonstrated significant resistance to tetracycline and azithromycin, with MICs reaching up to 64\u202f\u03bcg/mL (Table 1). Meanwhile, the tested Gram-negative strains also exhibited elevated MIC values for colistin, with K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii showing MICs in the range of 2\u201316\u202f\u03bcg/mL, while P. aeruginosa exhibited an MIC as high as 32\u202f\u03bcg/mL, indicating substantial resistance (Table 1). Furthermore, all tested Gram-negative strains displayed high MICs for levofloxacin, tetracycline, azithromycin, and penicillin, with some isolates exhibiting MICs as high as 256\u202f\u03bcg/mL for azithromycin and 128\u202f\u03bcg/mL for tetracycline, highlighting their multidrug-resistant (MDR) nature (Table 1). Overall, these findings suggested that Gram-negative bacteria exhibited a more severe resistance profile, whereas Gram-positive bacteria retained partial susceptibility to certain antibiotics. These results underscore the significant challenges associated with treating COPD-related infections and emphasize the urgent need for novel drugs and combination therapy strategies to enhance treatment efficacy.\n\n## Benzbromarone in synergy with colistin to fight resistant Gram-negative bacteria\nBenzbromarone was reported to be a membrane-active compound that disrupted Gram-positive bacterial membranes but showed no direct activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Colistin, a last-line agent targeting the Gram-negative outer membrane, was increasingly compromised by resistant strains. We therefore hypothesized that benzbromarone could serve as an adjuvant to potentiate colistin activity, not for its clinical indication but for its unique membrane-active properties. To further evaluate the synergistic antibacterial activity of benzbromarone and colistin against drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, we selected three highly colistin-resistant strains and employed the checkerboard dilution method to assess the combination inhibitory effects. The results indicated that for K. pneumoniae12136, heatmap analysis showed that even at relatively high concentrations of colistin (\u22654\u202f\u03bcg/mL) or Benzbromarone (\u226532\u202f\u03bcg/mL), bacterial growth remained robust, suggesting a high level of resistance to both drugs when used individually (Figure 1A). However, when colistin and benzbromarone were combined, bacterial growth was significantly inhibited, as indicated by a progressive lightening of color in the heatmap, demonstrating a strong synergistic antibacterial effect (Figure 1A). This finding suggested that benzbromarone enhanced colistin\u2019s antibacterial activity against K. pneumoniae 12136. For A. baumannii 50114, which exhibited slightly lower resistance to colistin than K. pneumoniae 12136, bacterial growth was already significantly inhibited at colistin\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u03bcg/mL. However, only when benzbromarone reached \u226532\u202f\u03bcg/mL did colistin sensitivity markedly improve (Figure 1B). In contrast, P. aeruginosa 10147 exhibited the highest level of resistance to both colistin and benzbromarone. Nevertheless, a certain degree of synergistic effect was still observed, with bacterial growth being noticeably restricted at colistin\u202f=\u202f0.5\u202f\u03bcg/mL and benzbromarone\u202f=\u202f64\u202f\u03bcg/mL (Figure 1C). In short, these findings suggested that benzbromarone significantly enhanced the antibacterial activity of colistin against resistant Gram-negative bacteria, highlighting its potential role as a colistin potentiator in the treatment of drug-resistant bacterial infections.\n\n## Benzbromarone and colistin combination significantly inhibits the growth of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria\nTo further confirm whether benzbromarone can restore the inhibitory effect of colistin on highly colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and validate its potential as a colistin potentiator, we monitored bacterial growth dynamics by measuring OD600 values to assess the enhancement effect of benzbromarone on colistin activity. The combined concentrations applied in the growth inhibition and related experiments were selected according to the synergistic concentration ranges determined by the checkerboard assay. Growth curve analysis of K. pneumoniae 12136 (Figure 2A), A. baumannii 50114 (Figure 2B), and P. aeruginosa 10147 (Figure 2C) showed that in the control group (blue), colistin group (red), and Benzbromarone group (green), bacterial growth trends were similar, with OD600 values increasing over time. This indicated that monotherapy with either 0.5\u202f\u03bcg/mL colistin or 64\u202f\u03bcg/mL benzbromarone had limited inhibitory effects on bacterial growth. However, in the combination treatment group (purple), bacterial growth was completely suppressed, with OD600 values remaining close to zero, demonstrating that benzbromarone significantly enhanced colistin\u2019s antibacterial activity against all three strains. Although P. aeruginosa 10147 exhibited the highest resistance to colistin, benzbromarone still enhanced its antibacterial effect, and their synergistic action was sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth. Overall, this experiment further confirmed that benzbromarone significantly enhanced colistin\u2019s antibacterial activity against highly resistant Gram-negative bacteria and exerted strong synergistic effects on K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa. These results aligned with the findings from the checkerboard assay, supporting the potential application of benzbromarone as a colistin potentiator.\n\n## Synergistic bactericidal effect of benzbromarone and colistin against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria\nUnderstanding the mode of action of antimicrobial agents\u2014whether bactericidal (killing bacteria) or bacteriostatic (inhibiting bacterial growth without killing)\u2014is crucial for clinical applications. While our previous OD600 growth curve experiments demonstrated that benzbromarone enhanced colistin\u2019s antibacterial activity against resistant Gram-negative bacteria. OD600 primarily reflected total biomass and does not distinguish between bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects. Therefore, we employed the colony-forming unit (CFU/mL) counting method to dynamically monitor the viable bacterial population over 12\u202fh, aiming to elucidate the mechanism of action when Benzbromarone and Colistin are used in combination. The results showed that for K. pneumoniae 12136, the CFU count in the control, colistin-only, and benzbromarone-only groups continued to increase over time, maintaining log10 CFU/mL levels between 9 and 10 at 12\u202fh (Figure 3A). This indicated that monotherapy with 0.5\u202f\u03bcg/mL colistin or 64\u202f\u03bcg/mL benzbromarone had no significant bactericidal effect. However, in the combination treatment group, the bacterial count began to decline after 2\u202fh and dropped to the detection limit by 10\u202fh, demonstrating a strong bactericidal effect (Figure 3A). Similarly, for A. baumannii 50114, the colistin-only and benzbromarone-only groups showed bacterial growth patterns similar to the control (blue). In contrast, the combination treatment group (purple) exhibited a log10 CFU/mL count below 1 at 10\u202fh, indicating a potent bactericidal effect (Figure 3B). For P. aeruginosa 10147, bacterial counts in the combination treatment group approached the detection limit at 12\u202fh, suggesting a significant bactericidal effect (Figure 3C). However, the killing rate was slower compared to K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii, indicating potential differences in bacterial susceptibility to the combination therapy. In addition, the evaluation of hemolytic activity on red blood cells and cytotoxicity on mammalian cells showed that colistin, either alone or in combination with benzbromarone (64\u202f\u03bcg/mL), did not cause significant hemolysis within the concentration range of 0\u201364\u202f\u03bcg/mL (Figure 3D). The hemolysis rate was comparable to that of the negative control, and only the Triton X-100 group exhibited marked hemolysis (Figure 3D). These results indicate that the combination of benzbromarone and colistin does not increase hemolytic toxicity. In HepG2 cells (Figure 3E) and Vero cells (Figure 3F), colistin alone or combined with benzbromarone showed no significant effect on cell viability at different concentrations, with cell viability remaining at a high level. These findings not only confirmed the potential of Benzbromarone as a colistin potentiator but also provided a novel therapeutic strategy for treating infections caused by colistin-resistant bacteria.\n\n## Benzbromarone enhances colistin-induced bacterial membrane permeability\nColistin, a polymyxin antibiotic, exerts its bactericidal effect primarily by binding to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, disrupting membrane integrity and leading to bacterial death. However, resistant bacteria often modify LPS structure, enhance outer membrane barrier function, or activate efflux systems to reduce colistin\u2019s bactericidal efficacy. Our previous findings demonstrated that benzbromarone enhanced colistin\u2019s bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-negative bacteria, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To investigate this, we used 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) fluorescence assay and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence assay to assess changes in bacterial outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane permeability, respectively. NPN fluorescence intensity analysis revealed no significant differences among the control, colistin-only, and benzbromarone-only groups, indicating that neither 0.5\u202f\u03bcg/mL colistin nor 64\u202f\u03bcg/mL benzbromarone alone significantly disrupted the bacterial outer membrane (Figure 4A). However, the combination treatment group exhibited a significantly higher NPN fluorescence signal (p\u202f<\u202f0.01), suggesting that benzbromarone enhanced colistin-induced outer membrane damage, facilitating NPN penetration and thereby increasing membrane permeability (Figure 4A). Similarly, PI fluorescence analysis showed no significant differences among the control, colistin-only, and benzbromarone-only groups, indicating that neither colistin nor benzbromarone alone significantly compromised the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. In contrast, the combination treatment group displayed the highest PI fluorescence signal, with a statistically significant difference compared to other groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Figure 4B). This result indicated that benzbromarone enhanced colistin-induced cytoplasmic membrane damage, allowing PI to penetrate and bind to intracellular DNA, thereby increasing fluorescence intensity. Meanwhile, ROS fluorescence assays (C) revealed that combined treatment significantly promoted the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, reaching levels far higher than those observed in the single-drug groups, suggesting that the combined drug effect can trigger a strong oxidative stress response (Figure 4C). Furthermore, ATP content assays demonstrated that combined treatment with colistin and benzbromarone resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular ATP levels and a severe inhibition of energy metabolism (Figure 4D). Moreover, SYTO 9/PI double-stained bacterial samples were further imaged using a laser confocal microscope (Figure 4E). The results showed that green fluorescence (live bacteria) was predominant in the drug-alone treatment group, while red fluorescence (dead bacteria) increased significantly in the combined drug treatment group, suggesting that combined drug treatment has a strong destructive effect on bacteria, achieved through membrane disruption (Figure 4E). Scanning electron microscopy images further revealed changes in the bacterial surface ultrastructure: the cell surface of the control group was smooth and intact, while the cell surface showed slight wrinkling and damage after treatment with Colistin or Benzbromarone alone (Figure 4F). In the combined treatment group, the cell morphology was severely deformed, with a rough surface and accompanied by ruptures, indicating that the cell structure was severely damaged (Figure 4F). Taken together, these results indicate that the combination of Colistin and Benzbromarone can synergistically enhance bacterial membrane damage, promote ROS accumulation, and inhibit ATP production, resulting in a stronger killing effect on bacteria.\n\n## Benzbromarone enhanced the antibacterial activity of colistin sensitivity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria \nColistin serves as the last-line therapy against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, the emergence of colistin-resistant strains presents a significant clinical challenge. Our previous in vitro studies demonstrated that benzbromarone (Ben) significantly enhanced the antibacterial activity of colistin (Col) against MDR Gram-negative bacteria. However, in vitro evidence alone is insufficient to evaluate its protective effects in living organisms. Therefore, we employed the Galleria mellonella (wax moth larvae) infection model to assess the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of colistin and benzbromarone combination therapy, using survival rate (%) as the primary outcome measure. Experimental results showed that in K. pneumoniae (Figure 5A), P. aeruginosa (Figure 5B), and A. baumannii (Figure 5C) infection models, untreated larvae (Untreated group) succumbed entirely within 3\u202fdays, indicating the high lethality of these MDR Gram-negative pathogens. Monotherapy with colistin (5\u202fmg/kg) or benzbromarone (5\u202fmg/kg) slightly improved survival rates, but the five-day survival rate remained below 30%, suggesting that single-drug treatment provides limited protection against severe infections. Interestingly, although benzbromarone alone did not display antibacterial activity in vitro, treatment of infected larvae with benzbromarone (5\u202fmg/kg) improved survival compared with the untreated group. This protective effect may be related to its reported anti-inflammatory and antioxidative activities rather than direct bacterial killing. In contrast, the combination therapy group (colistin 2.5\u202fmg/kg\u202f+\u202fbenzbromarone 5\u202fmg/kg) exhibited significantly improved survival rates, reaching approximately 70% for K. pneumoniae, 60% for P. aeruginosa, and 70% for A. baumannii infections. These findings indicated that benzbromarone enhanced the in vivo antibacterial activity of colistin, allowing a 50% dose reduction (from 5\u202fmg/kg to 2.5\u202fmg/kg) while maintaining high survival rates. This dose reduction may also mitigate colistin-associated adverse effects. Overall, these results provided further support for benzbromarone as a potential colistin adjuvant, offering experimental evidence for its application in combination therapy against MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections.\n\n## Discussion\nCombination therapy has emerged as an important strategy to address antimicrobial resistance. Compared with monotherapy, drug combinations can broaden the antibacterial spectrum, reduce the required dose of individual agents, enhance bactericidal activity, and delay the emergence of resistance (30). In particular, combining membrane-active adjuvants with last-line antibiotics offers a rational approach to overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanisms (31). In this study, we selected the combination of benzbromarone and colistin based on the complementary nature of their mechanisms of action. Previous studies have shown that benzbromarone, as a membrane-active compound, can disrupt the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria but exhibits no direct antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (29). In contrast, colistin is one of the last-line antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections, targeting the bacterial outer membrane. However, the frequent emergence of colistin-resistant strains has greatly limited its efficacy as monotherapy. Based on this background, we hypothesized that benzbromarone could act as an adjuvant to enhance the antibacterial activity of colistin and help overcome resistance. It should be noted that benzbromarone was not selected because of its clinical indication, but rather for its unique membrane-active properties, which make it a rational candidate for exploring colistin-potentiating strategies. This study therefore evaluated the antibiotic resistance profiles of respiratory pathogens associated with COPD and further examined the antibacterial effects of benzbromarone\u2013colistin combination therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that respiratory pathogens in COPD patients displayed high resistance rates to multiple conventional antibiotics, with P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii showing particularly severe resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides. Colistin remained one of the few antibiotics with good activity against these resistant strains. This finding was consistent with global reports of rising antimicrobial resistance in COPD patients in recent years (17, 32), highlighting the need for clinicians to consider the widespread transmission of resistant bacteria and its impact on antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, the resistance data from this study support the necessity of combination therapy, emphasizing the importance of identifying suitable potentiators to be used in conjunction with colistin to reduce its required dosage, enhance therapeutic efficacy, and minimize the survival and spread of resistant bacteria.\nBenzbromarone is a classic uricosuric agent primarily used for the treatment of hyperuricemia (26). However, recent studies have suggested that certain non-antibiotic drugs may possess potential antimicrobial activity or enhance the efficacy of antibiotics (33, 34). This study systematically explored, for the first time, the antibacterial effects of the combined use of benzbromarone and colistin against COPD-related pathogens. While benzbromarone itself exhibited no significant antibacterial activity, its combination with colistin significantly reduced the latter\u2019s MIC. Moreover, the combination of benzbromarone and colistin demonstrated synergistic effects (FICI\u202f<\u202f0.5). This phenomenon may be related to benzbromarone enhancing the interaction between colistin and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby increasing bacterial membrane permeability and facilitating the bactericidal action of colistin. Further membrane permeability assays confirmed that benzbromarone could restore colistin\u2019s ability to disrupt the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies have shown that benzbromarone enhanced antimicrobial activity by affecting membrane stability in Gram-positive bacteria (29), and our study further suggested that it similarly influence bacterial membrane structures in Gram-negative bacteria through an indirect mechanism. Notably, benzbromarone\u2019s direct effect in Gram-positive bacteria primarily involved disrupting membrane stability, whereas in Gram-negative bacteria, its effect relied on colistin\u2019s outer membrane-disrupting activity, indicating mechanistic differences across bacterial types. Additionally, since the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria often serves as a barrier to antimicrobial agents (35), benzbromarone\u2019s ability to enhance colistin\u2019s permeability is particularly important, potentially making it an ideal potentiator for colistin and other antimicrobial peptides. Time-kill assays further confirmed this phenomenon, showing a significant reduction in bacterial colony counts within a shorter time in the combination group, with a faster bactericidal rate than colistin alone. In addition to membrane disruption, our results demonstrated that the combination of colistin and benzbromarone markedly induced intracellular ROS accumulation and reduced ATP levels in Gram-negative bacteria. Excessive ROS can damage cellular components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, while ATP depletion impairs essential metabolic processes and energy-dependent repair systems. Together, these effects further compromise bacterial viability and may explain the enhanced bactericidal activity observed with the combination treatment. These findings suggest that benzbromarone not only potentiates colistin by destabilizing the bacterial membrane but also contributes to oxidative stress and energy metabolism collapse, thereby providing a multifaceted mechanism underlying the observed synergy. This finding not only provided a novel strategy for treating drug-resistant bacterial infections, but also offered experimental evidence for optimizing colistin dosage. However, this study did not fully elucidate the precise mechanism of benzbromarone\u2019s action. Future studies should integrate molecular biology techniques to identify its potential targets and signaling pathways.\nCurrently, infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria have become a major challenge in clinical treatment, particularly due to the resistance of MDR P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii to multiple antibiotics, severely limiting therapeutic options (36). Colistin remains a crucial treatment choice for such resistant infections due to its unique mechanism of action. However, its dose-dependent toxicity restricts clinical use (37, 38). Previous studies have shown that certain non-antibiotic drugs, such as auranofin (39) and flavomycinn (40), can enhance colistin\u2019s antibacterial activity. This study further demonstrated that benzbromarone could serve as a potential colistin potentiator, allowing for a reduction in the effective dosage of colistin, thereby mitigating adverse effects associated with high-dose administration. Compared to other potentiators, benzbromarone exhibited a distinct advantage, as its synergistic effect has been validated across multiple resistant strains without observed antagonism, highlighting its strong potential for combination therapy. Additionally, benzbromarone were a clinically approved uricosuric agent widely used in the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia (26), yet studies on its antimicrobial activity remain limited. This study is the first to reveal benzbromarone\u2019s ability to enhance colistin\u2019s antibacterial effects and experimentally confirm its role in lowering the MIC of colistin-resistant bacterial strains. These findings not only expand the pharmacological profile of benzbromarone but also provide a new direction for the development of antibiotic potentiators. Furthermore, COPD patients often receive long-term antibiotic treatments, leading to a high prevalence of drug-resistant respiratory pathogens (41, 42). The findings of this study provide a new perspective for future therapeutic strategies against COPD-related multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, potentially improving clinical outcomes in resistant bacterial infections.
