Most importantly, resistance development assay showed that CAS was less susceptible to accelerating the resistance development of drug-sensitive strain E. coli MG1655. Functional studies and RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the mechanisms by which CAS enhanced the antimicrobial activities of antibiotics were involved in permeabilizing the bacterial cell envelope, disrupting proton motive force and inhibiting bacterial biofilm formation.

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) has posed a huge threat to human and animal health worldwide (Croft et al., 2007; Ferri et al., 2017; Samreen et al., 2021). The statistics of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 showed that AMR caused at least 700,000 deaths every year (Mancuso et al., 2021). The six major pathogenic bacteria that lead to deaths include \u201cESKAPE\u201d (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) (Collaborators A.R, 2022), most of which are Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). It is reported that we are facing the threat of untreatable multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria infections (Karaiskos and Giamarellou, 2014).\nAlthough great efforts have been made to develop novel strategies to unravel bacterial resistance, which include the development of antibiotic alternatives, such as vaccines, probiotics, and phage therapy (Allen et al., 2014; Hoelzer et al., 2018; Browne et al., 2020), the AMR rate is still sharply growing. Thus, novel antimicrobial strategies are urgently needed to combat AMR.\nConsidering the difficulty in developing novel antimicrobials, the discovery of antibiotic adjuvants is a meaningful point for combating AMR (Kumar et al., 2023). Antibiotic adjuvants are a class of compounds that commonly show little or no antimicrobial activity themselves but can block resistance and promote antibiotic activity by targeting efflux pumps, modifying enzymes, bacterial cell permeability, or host defense systems (Douafer et al., 2019). They have been extensively used in clinical therapy; for example, clavulanic acid and sulbactam are used to enhance the antimicrobial activities of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (Reading and Cole, 1977; Kanra, 2002). It is established that antibiotic adjuvants can greatly extend the clinical existing antibiotic lifespan (Gonz\u00e1lez-Bello, 2017).\nGNB possess intrinsic antibiotic resistance, which can be mainly attributed to their envelope barrier (Maher and Hassan, 2023), especially the asymmetrical outer membrane (OM) (Delcour, 2009). Bacterial OM biogenesis is involved in many protein complex machineries, including BamABCDE (OM proteins folded machinery), LolCDE (OM lipoprotein transporter), LptB2FGC [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transporter] (Choi and Lee, 2019), all of which are the promising targets for antimicrobials (Naclerio and Sintim, 2020). There are some compounds targeting these complexes that have been identified as antimicrobials; for example, a BamA inhibitor, darobactin, was found to have great antimicrobial potency (Imai et al., 2019), and zosurabalpin was also identified as antimicrobial by targeting the LPS transporter LptB2FGC (Zampaloni et al., 2024). In addition, several compounds have also been screened out to disrupt the integrity of bacterial OM, recovering the efficacy of existing antibiotics against AMR strains, such as SLAP-S25 and LL-17 (Shurko et al., 2018; Song et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022). Hence, bacterial OM is also a promising target for antibiotic adjuvants.\nHydrophobic antibiotics have difficulty entering the cytoplasm of GNB (Savage, 2001), resulting in a significantly limited variety of antibiotics available for treating GNB infections. Rifampin is a classical hydrophobic antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by not only Tuberculosis mycobacteria but also other bacterial pathogens such as S. aureus (Lee et al., 2017). Notably, rifampin was sometimes used for the treatment of GNB pathogens in clinics; for example, the combination of carbapenem and rifampin successfully cured the infection of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae bacteremia (Lin et al., 2021). Many previous studies also showed that the antimicrobial activities of rifampin against GNB pathogens could be enhanced by several bacterial membrane disruptors, such as D-LANA-14 and ACP-1 (Gly) (Barman et al., 2019; Konai and Haldar, 2020). Taken together, the synergy of bacterial membrane disruptors and hydrophobic antibiotics is a promising antimicrobial strategy to combat GNB pathogens.\nIn this study, we established a high-throughput method of screening antibiotic adjuvants targeting bacterial OM and performed FDA-approved drug repurposing. Casoufungin acetate (CAS) was identified as a potential antibiotic adjuvant to enhance the antimicrobial activities of rifampin or colistin against GNB strains in vitro or in vivo. Our data also showed that the synergistic effects of CAS in combination with antibiotics were driven by destructing the bacterial envelope, dissipating proton motive force (PMF), and inhibiting biofilm formation. In particular, we identified that PgaC might be the CAS target, and an enzymatic assay showed that the CAS inhibits PgaC activity. In summary, this study provides an antibiotic adjuvant candidate that is worth further evaluating and exploring.\n\n## Bacterial strains and drug library\nBacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1. All strains were cultured in a lysogeny broth (LB) medium. The FDA-approved drug library (3,158 compounds) was purchased from Targetmol, and the detailed information is listed in Supplementary Table 2. The library was supplied in 96-well plates of 10\u2009mM stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\n## High-throughput screening for antibiotics against \nTo screen for antibiotic adjuvants against GNB, the mid-log phase cells of E. coli MG1655 were diluted in LB medium with 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL rifampin in 96-well plates containing library drugs or polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN, positive control) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, negative control). After 8\u2009h of static culture at 37\u00b0C, the optical density at 600\u2009nm (OD600) was measured using a microplate reader. Percentage inhibition was calculated as (ODN \u2013 ODX)/(ODN \u2013 ODP)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100%, where ODX is the OD600 value for a test treated with drug X, and ODP and ODN are the OD600 values for the positive and negative control, respectively.\n\n## Checkerboard assay\nCheckerboard assays were performed to evaluate the synergistic effect of CAS in combination with antibiotics as previously described (Cai et al., 2023). Briefly, antibiotics and CAS were diluted two times with MHB medium (with or without Mg2+ or EDTA) in a 96-well plate, respectively, to form an 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 medium, and an equal volume (200\u2009\u03bcL/well) of bacterial suspension with the drug was cultured. A microplate reader was used to measure the OD600 value after 18\u2009h of culture at 37\u00b0C (the OD600 value over 0.1 indicates bacterial growth). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated using the following formula: FICI\u2009=\u2009MICab/MICa\u2009+\u2009MICba/MICb. MICa and MICb are the corresponding MIC values of compounds A and B alone, respectively; MICab is the MIC value of compound A combined with compound B; and MICba is the MIC value of compound B combined with compound A. Indicative of synergy is FICI \u22640.5.\n\n## Time-kill curve against \nThe bactericidal curves of CAS against drug-sensitive and resistant E. coli strains were determined, respectively. The 106\u2009CFU of E. coli MG1655 and 72 strains were washed and resuspended in an MHB medium, then treated with CAS and rifampin alone or in combination, and a control group without any treatment. At each time point (0, 4, 8, and 24\u2009h), 100\u2009\u03bcL of the bacterial solution was continuously diluted 10-fold in physiological saline. Subsequently, the suspension was then plated onto LB agar plates and cultured for an overnight period at 37\u00b0C for bacterial count.\n\n## Outer membrane permeability assay\nThe fluorescent probe N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) was used to evaluate the outer membrane integrity of E. coli treated by CAS or combined with rifampin as described previously (Song et al., 2020). Briefly, the mid-phase cells of E. coli were washed and suspended with 5\u2009mM of HEPES (pH 7.0\u2009+\u20095\u2009mM of glucose). Then, the samples were standardized to an OD600 value of 0.5, and the dye NPN was added to a final concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcM. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, 190\u2009\u03bcL of probe-labeled bacterial cells were added to a 96-well plate, and then CAS or rifampin was added. After incubation for 30\u2009min, the fluorescence intensity was measured on a microplate reader with the excitation wavelength at 350\u2009nm and the emission wavelength at 420\u2009nm.\n\n## Membrane integrity assay\nFluorescent probe PI was used to assess the inner membrane integrity of E. coli treated by CAS or combined with rifampin as described previously (Song et al., 2020). Briefly, the mid-phase cells of E. coli were washed and suspended in a phosphate-buffered solution (PBS). Then, the samples were standardized to an OD600 value of 0.5, followed by the addition of 10\u2009nM of propidium iodide (PI) in the presence of CAS or combined with rifampin. After incubation for 30\u2009min, the samples were measured on a microplate reader with the excitation wavelength at 535\u2009nm and the emission wavelength at 615\u2009nm.\n\n## Extracellular \u03b2-galactosidase determination\nThe mid-phase cells of E. coli were washed and resuspended to obtain an OD600 value of 0.5 with PBS buffer. Then, the samples were treated with CAS or combined with rifampin for 1\u2009h at 37\u00b0C and centrifuged at 12,000\u2009rpm for another 10\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatants were collected to determine the activity of \u03b2-galactosidase. Briefly, 190\u2009\u03bcL of the supernatants were added to each well in a 96-well microplate, followed by the addition of a final concentration of 3\u2009mM of 2-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG, a substrate of \u03b2-galactosidase). After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, the absorbance at 420\u2009nm was measured using a microplate reader.\n\n## Measurement of membrane potential\nThe mid-phase E. coli cells were washed and resuspended to obtain an OD600 value of 0.5 with 5\u2009mM of HEPES (pH 7.0\u2009+\u20095\u2009mM of glucose). The fluorescent probe 3,3\u2032-Dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)) (a final concentration of 0.5\u2009\u03bcM) was added and incubated for 30\u2009min. The probed cells of E. coli were mixed with a variety of concentrations of CAS (8, 16, 32\u2009\u03bcg/mL), then measured using an excitation wavelength at 622\u2009nm, and an emission wavelength at 670\u2009nm with a microplate reader.\n\n## Measurement of bacterial inner pH\nThe mid-phase E. coli cells were washed and resuspended to obtain an OD600 value of 0.5 with 5\u2009mM of HEPES (pH 7.0\u2009+\u20095\u2009mM of glucose) and the final concentration of 2\u2009\u03bcM pH-sensitive fluorescent probe 2\u2032,7\u2032-bis-(2 carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) was added. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, the samples were treated with a variety of concentrations of CAS (8, 16, 32\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. The fluorescence intensity was immediately monitored with the excitation wavelength of 488\u2009nm and emission wavelength of 535\u2009nm.\n\n## Biofilm formation assay\nBiofilm formation of E. coli was measured as described previously with minor modifications (Wang et al., 2004). Briefly, the mid-log phase cells of E. coli were transformed into LB medium containing 0.2% glucose and CAS or combined with rifampin, then incubated at 26\u00b0C for 48\u2009h. The planktonic bacteria were removed, and the biofilm was washed with PBS. Subsequently, the samples were fixed with methanol for 15\u2009min, stained with 1% crystal violet for 10\u2009min, and then washed with PBS. After adding 33% glacial acetic acid to dissolve the dye, the absorbance at 595\u2009nm (OD595) was recorded with a microplate reader. Biofilm formation was also visualized by aliquoting 1\u2009mL of diluted culture into 1.5\u2009mL polystyrene microtubes and incubating statically at 26\u00b0C for 48\u2009h. Biofilms were then stained by the addition of 200\u2009\u03bcL of crystal violet and incubated for 15\u2009min, washed three times with PBS buffer, and photographed.\n\n## RNA-seq analysis\nTo analyze the transcriptome changes of E. coli MG1655 after CAS treatment, RNA-seq was conducted by MAGIGENE, Guangzhou. Briefly, RNA samples were extracted from the mid-log phase cells of the strains using the Trizol method. The quality control of RNA samples was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis, Thermo NanoDrop One, and Agilent 4,200 Tape Station. The ribosomal RNA was removed from the samples, and the library was constructed using the NEBNext\u00ae Ultra II\u2122 Directional RNA Library Prep Kit. The library was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq/MiSeq platform. Quality control of raw reads was performed, and clean reads were mapped onto the E. coli MG1655 genome. The gene expression levels were analyzed using the feature counts (Dillies et al., 2013) and DEseq2 (Love et al., 2014). The DEGs were identified by setting the threshold |log2 (foldchange) | \u22651 and a p-value of \u22640.05. The enrichment based on the KEGG pathway database was analyzed.1 To validate the DEGs, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using primers listed in Supplementary Table 3 (QuantStudio 6 Flex, Micromeritics, Shanghai, China). The relative levels of target gene expression were normalized with the gapdh gene using the 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct method.\n\n## Swarming assay\nThe effect of CAS on the swarming motility of E. coli was investigated as described previously with minor modifications (She et al., 2022). Briefly, the medium for the motility assay was LB containing 0.5% agar and CAS (a final concentration at 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL). Then, 2\u2009\u03bcL volume of E. coli MG1655, 72 strains cultured at an OD600 of 0.5 were placed in the center of each plate, respectively, and allowed to stay for 30\u2009min. The plates were placed in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 24\u2009h.\n\n## Construction of the expression plasmid of PgaCD of \nThe plasmid pTrc99a-pgaCV227LpgaDN75D/K76E encodes the variant PgaCD of E. coli with a C-terminal strep tag in E. coli expression system, of which the enzymatic activity is independent of the regulation of c-di-GMP (Steiner et al., 2013). The coding sequence of the variant pgaCD was amplified by overlap extension PCR and subsequently cloned into the pTrc99a vector by homologous recombination. All the primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 3.\n\n## Protein expression and purification\nThe strep-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously. E. coli C43 (DE3) containing the plasmid pTrc99a-pgaCV227LpgaDN75D/K76E was grown to the mid-log phase, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.2\u2009mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), followed by incubation at 18\u00b0C for 16\u2009h. The cells were harvested and lysed by high-pressure crushing. The cell lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 12,000\u2009rpm for 20\u2009min at 4\u00b0C to remove the unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant was then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 36,300\u2009rpm at 4\u00b0C to obtain the membrane fractions. The membrane fractions were further solubilized in Buffer A (50\u2009mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300\u2009mM NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol, 1\u2009mM TCEP) supplemented with 1% w/v DDM/0.1% w/v CHS for 60\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16, 000\u2009g for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was applied to a gravity flow chromatography column packed with 2\u2009mL of Streptactin Beads 4FF (Smart-Lifescience) and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. The beads were washed with 40\u2009mL of Buffer A supplemented with 0.1% w/v DDM/0.01% w/v CHS, and eluted with 4\u2009mL of buffer A supplemented with 0.1% w/v DDM/0.01% w/v CHS and 2.5\u2009\u03bcM d-Desthiobiotin. Protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration and verified using the NanoDrop100 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\n\n## PgaCD enzymatic activity assay\nPgaCD glycosyltransferase activity assay was performed as described previously with minor modifications (Steiner et al., 2013). Briefly, 50\u2009\u03bcL reaction mixtures containing PgaCD complex (0.32\u2009mg/mL) in glycosyltransferase activity buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300\u2009mM NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol, 1\u2009mM TCEP, 5\u2009mM MgCl2) and a variety of concentrations of CAS (final concentrations of 0, 16, and 32\u2009\u03bcg/mL) were incubated for 18\u2009h at 37\u00b0C with or without 2\u2009mM UDP-GlcNAc. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000\u2009rpm at 4\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. The supernatants were added with shrimp alkaline phosphatase and incubated for 30\u2009min at room temperature, followed by incubation at 65\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Phosphate content (indirect measure for UDP) was determined spectrophotometrically at 630\u2009nm using the color reagent containing molybdate and malachite green.\n\n## Resistance development study\nThe resistance development study was performed as described previously with minor modifications (Konai and Haldar, 2015). Briefly, E. coli MG1655 overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in LB broth containing 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC of rifampin or combined with 8\u2009\u03bcg/mL CAS. After 12\u2009h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the bacterial culture was diluted 1:100 in fresh LB broth containing 0.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC of rifampin or combined with 8\u2009\u03bcg/mL CAS to continue the next generation. In every three passages, the MIC of the cultures was measured. The process was repeated for 15 passages.\n\nThe G. mellonella larvae model was used to evaluate the virulence of E. coli as described previously (Song et al., 2020). A total of 40\u2009G. mellonella larvae were randomly divided into four groups (10 per group), which were injected with 2.25\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u2009CFU of E. coli 72, or the same volume of saline, respectively, via the leaf posterior proleg of G. mellonalla larvae, followed by CAS (64\u2009mg/kg) and rifampin (16\u2009mg/kg) alone or in combination administrations via the right posterior proleg. The survival of G. mellonella larvae was recorded at 6\u2009h intervals for 48\u2009h.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nThe data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test or log-rank test in GraphPad Prism 7 software, with a p-value of <0.05 considered to be statistically significant.\n\n## Primary screening of FDA-approved drug library\nAn FDA-approved library containing 3,158 compounds was subjected to testing for synergistic antimicrobial activity with rifampin (at a concentration without bioactivity) against the E. coli MG1655 strain. As shown in Figure 1A, 235 hits in combination with rifampin exhibited a growth inhibition of over 50% (Supplementary Table 4). Subsequently, the individual efficacies of all the hits against the E. coli MG1655 strain were measured, respectively. Of these hits, the growth inhibitions of 221 hits alone against E. coli MG1655 were higher than 50% (Supplementary Table 4), but the 221 hits belong to known antibiotics and identified non-antibiotic compounds with antimicrobial activity. Of the other 14 hits, CAS, an antifungal agent with weak antimicrobial efficacy (Figure 1B), significantly enhanced the potency of rifampin, which hinted that CAS could potentiate the antimicrobial activity of rifampin against E. coli MG1655.\n\n## CAS potentiates the efficacy of rifampin and colistin against Gram-negative bacteria \nTo determine the degree of synergy of CAS with rifampin or colistin against GNB, we performed checkerboard assays to determine FICI using several GNB strains. It was shown that CAS solely displayed a weak antibacterial activity against all tested E. coli strains, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) higher than or equal to 128\u2009\u03bcg/mL, but it could decrease the MIC values of rifampin against E. coli MG1655 (from 8\u2009\u03bcg/mL to 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) (Figure 2A), E. coli 69 (from 8\u2009\u03bcg/mL to 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) (Figure 2B), E. coli ATCC25922 (from 4\u2009\u03bcg/mL to 0.25\u2009\u03bcg/mL) (Figure 2C), and multidrug-resistant strain E. coli 72 (from 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL to 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) (Figure 2D), and enhance the bioactivity of colistin against these strains except E. coli 72 (Supplementary Table 5). Additionally, CAS was also found to decrease the MIC values of rifampin against Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC14028 (from 16\u2009\u03bcg/mL to 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) (Figure 2E) as well as P. aeruginosa PAO1 (from 16\u2009\u03bcg/mL to 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) (Figure 2F) and act synergistically with colistin against these two strains (Supplementary Table 5). Collectively, CAS could be confirmed as a potential adjuvant for rifampin or colistin against Gram-negative pathogens. To further evaluate the synergistic antimicrobial effect of CAS in combination with rifampin against drug-sensitive and resistant E. coli strains, the time-kill tests were performed for the tested strains, including E. coli MG1655 and E. coli 72. The results showed that CAS and rifampin at a specific dose alone exhibited no antimicrobial efficacy against these two strains, while CAS in combination with rifampin greatly killed these two strains (Figures 2G,H). Taken together, CAS indeed enhances the efficacy of rifampin or colistin against drug-sensitive or resistant GNB strains, which implies that the mode of action of CAS might not be limited to targeting the resistant mechanism.\n\n## CAS impaired bacterial envelope\nThe envelope of GNB is composed of an asymmetric OM, a thin peptidoglycan, and a cytoplasmic or inner membrane (IM) (Saha et al., 2021), which is a protective barrier. The bacterial envelope disruptors can potentiate the efficacy of hydrophobic antibiotics by destroying the envelope. To explore the antimicrobial mechanisms of the combination of CAS and rifampin, we first evaluated the OM and IM integrities of cells of E. coli treated with CAS. The results showed that the dose-dependent increases in fluorescence intensities of dye NPN-labeled cells of E. coli MG1655 and multidrug-resistant E. coli 72 treated with CAS alone were observed, respectively (Figures 3A,B). The results suggested that CAS alone could disrupt bacterial OM integrity. Consistently, checkerboard assays demonstrated that Mg2+ and EDTA resulted in a lower and higher synergistic degree of CAS in combination with rifampin against E. coli MG1655, respectively (Supplementary Figures 1A, 2B). Similarly, it was also found that CAS alone increased the fluorescence intensities of PI-labeled bacterial cells of the two test strains in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 3C,D). Additionally, the dose-dependent increased releases of \u03b2-galactosidase of the two test strains were also observed in the presence of CAS alone (Figures 3E,F). Notably, we also determined the bacterial membrane integrities and extracellular \u03b2-galactosidase releases in the presence of the combination of CAS and rifampin; however, there were no higher fluorescence intensities of NPN or PI-labeled bacterial cells of E. coli MG1655 and E. coli 72 treated with the combination of CAS and rifampin compared with CAS alone (Supplementary Figures 2A\u2013D), and the \u03b2-galactosidase releases of the combination treatments were not higher than those of CAS acting alone (Supplementary Figures 2E,F). Taken together, these data hinted that CAS-induced bacterial envelope perturbation was a prerequisite for exhibiting the synergy with rifampin.\n\n## CAS changed the proton motivative force (PMF) of \nThe PMF is an electrochemical gradient of protons across the cell membrane which is required for various bacterial cellular processes (Yang et al., 2023). PMF consists of the electric potential (\u0394\u03a8) and the transmembrane proton gradient (\u0394pH) (Yang et al., 2023). In this study, the membrane potential-sensitive dye DiSC3(5) was used to measure \u0394\u03a8, and CAS led to an increase in fluorescence (Figures 4A,B), which implied that \u0394\u03a8 of E. coli MG1655 and E. coli 72 was dissipated. Additionally, the pH-sensitive probe BCECF-AM, was also used to measure intracellular pH, and CAS caused increased fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner in E. coli MG1655 and E. coli 72 (Figures 4C,D), which indicated that \u0394pH value increased by alkalization of cytoplasm in E. coli. It could be seen that CAS disrupted the PMF of E. coli.\n\n## CAS inhibited biofilm formation of \nBiofilm is one of the intrinsic factors of AMR. It was reported in the literature that CAS could inhibit the biofilm formations of S. aureus by targeting IcaA, a synthase of poly-N-acetylglucosamine polymers, sharing homology with fungal \u03b2-1-3-glucan synthase (a pharmacological target of CAS) (Siala et al., 2016). Consistently, our study also showed that CAS alone inhibited the biofilm formations of E. coli MG1655 and E. coli 72 strains (Figures 5A,B). However, we found that the cultures of E. coli 72 rather than E. coli MG1655 treated with the combination of CAS and rifampin formed more biofilm compared with CAS alone, but still significantly less biofilm compared with blank treatment (Supplementary Figures 3A,B). Furthermore, by bioinformatics, PgaC in E. coli was deemed as a homologous protein to IcaA. Previous studies showed that the enzymatic activity of the PgaCV227LPgaDN75D/K76E variant is independent of the regulation of c-di-GMP (Steiner et al., 2013). The variant complex was therefore expressed and purified for an enzymatic assay (Supplementary Figure 4). The results showed that CAS indeed inhibited the biosynthesis of poly-GlcNAc mediated by the variant of PgaCD (Figure 5C). Taken together, a tentative conclusion can be drawn that CAS inhibited biofilm formation of E. coli by disturbing biosynthesis of poly-GlcNAc mediated by PgaCD.\n\n## Transcriptome analysis of \nTo further explore the antimicrobial mechanisms of CAS, a transcriptome analysis of E. coli MG1655 treated with CAS was performed. A total of 606 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the test group (E. coli MG1655 treated with CAS) and the control group (Figure 6A; Supplementary Table 6). Subsequently, the reliability of transcriptome data was further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 5). KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs in the test group were involved in bacterial chemotaxis, citrate cycle, ABC transporters, quorum sensing, and metabolism-related pathways (Figure 6B). Notably, a part of DEGs required for bacterial envelope stress responses and membrane biogenesis were upregulated in the test group, such as rcsA, waaG, and waaP. Conversely, fadA, fadB, fadE, fadI, and fadJ, which are involved in the fatty acid (the building blocks of the plasma membrane) degradation, were downregulated (Figure 6C). These changes in gene expression profile were consistent with E. coli treated with polymyxin targeting the bacterial membrane (Nang et al., 2022). Altogether, these data hinted that the membrane biogenesis pathways of E. coli treated with CAS were activated as feedback. Additionally, the genes related to glycerol-3-phosphate metabolism were significantly downregulated in the test group (Figure 6C), which also agreed with previous studies that the decreased levels of glycerol-3-phosphate-conferred antibiotic tolerance (Kurabayashi et al., 2015). Interestingly, bacterial chemotaxis and flagellar assembly are other important enriched pathways in DEGs (Figure 6C). To verify the consistency between these gene-expressed profiles and phenotypes, we performed a bacterial swarming mobility assay. The results showed that CAS at 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL dramatically inhibited the swarming mobility of E. coli MG1655 and E. coli 72 (Figure 6D). Bacterial mobility is a prerequisite for bacterial biofilm formation. This may also be a mechanism of CAS-mediated perturbation of bacterial biofilm formation. In summary, the transcriptome data support these phenotypes that CAS destroyed bacterial envelope integrity and inhibited bacterial motility.\n\n## The bioactive evaluations of analoges of CAS\nTo find out the higher bioactive antibiotic adjuvants and figure out the structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) of CAS, the echinocandin B nucleus and its three derivatives were subjected to determine its synergistic degree with rifampin against E. coli MG1655. Unfortunately, checkerboard assays suggested that all compounds, including Micafungin sodium, Anidulafungin, Pneumocandin B0 and Echinocandin B nucleus hydrochloride (ECBN HCL), displayed a weak synergistic activity with rifampin (Figures 7A\u2013D). Subsequently, the structural difference of these compounds was analyzed. It was shown in Figure 7E that CAS was obtained by replacing the negatively charged hydroxyl group and R group of 3-hydroxyglutamine of Pneumocandin B0 with a cationic aminoethyl ether group and the R group of 3-hydroxyornithine, respectively, which indicated that the positively charged moieties of CAS may increase its affinity with phospholipids with negative charges, hence, enhance its potency. Additionally, hydrophobic fatty acid chain of CAS attached to the echinocandin B nucleus has been considered an important moiety for its attachment to fungal membranes and antifungal potency (Szyma\u0144ski et al., 2022). Consistently, it is most likely to play a role in attaching the cell membrane of GNB.\n\n## Resistance development study\nThe rapid antibiotics resistance development of E. coli is alarming. In this study, the rifampin resistance development of drug-sensitive E. coli MG1655 in the presence of CAS was performed. The results showed that a 2- to 4-foldchange increase in MIC values of rifampin against E. coli MG1655 treated with rifampin alone or combined with CAS was observed (Figure 8). Hence, CAS was less susceptible to accelerating the resistance development of E. coli MG1655.\n\n## The synergistic efficacy of CAS in combination with rifampin against AMR \nTo further assess the potency of CAS in combination with rifampin in vivo, we utilized the G. mellonella larvae infection model for evaluating the virulence of multidrug-resistant strain E. coli 72. It was shown that CAS at 64\u2009mg/kg body weight and rifampin at 16\u2009mg/kg body weight alone could not reduce the death rate of G. mellonella larvae challenged with E. coli 72; however, a combination of the two drugs significantly reduced the mortality rate of G. mellonella larvae challenged with E. coli 72 (Figure 9). In summary, CAS also potentiated the efficacy of rifampin in vivo.\n\n## Discussion\nAMR has become a global health concern, resulting in huge economic and life losses, in particular for AMR of Gram-negative pathogens (Mukerji et al., 2017; Dettori et al., 2023). To date, developing novel antimicrobial strategies is still one of the most effective strategies to combat AMR. Recently, antibi",
