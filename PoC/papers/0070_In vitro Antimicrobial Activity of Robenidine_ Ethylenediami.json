  "abstract": "The emergence and global spread of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens demand alternative strategies to treat life-threatening infections. Combination drugs and repurposing of old compounds with known safety profiles that are not currently used in human medicine can address the problem of multidrug-resistant infections and promote antimicrobial stewardship in veterinary medicine. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of robenidine alone or in combination with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including those associated with canine otitis externa and human skin and soft tissue infection, was evaluated in vitro using microdilution susceptibility testing and the checkerboard method. Fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) and dose reduction indices (DRI) of the combinations against tested isolates were determined. Robenidine alone was bactericidal against Acinetobacter baumannii [minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) mode = 8 \u03bcg/ml] and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC mode = 2 \u03bcg/ml). Against Acinetobacter spp., an additivity/indifference of the combination of robenidine/EDTA (0.53 > FICIs > 1.06) and a synergistic effect of the combination of robenidine/PMBN (0.5 < FICI) were obtained. DRIs of robenidine were significantly increased in the presence of both EDTA and PMBN from 2- to 2048-fold. Robenidine exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of either EDTA or PMBN. Robenidine also demonstrated potent antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens and all Gram-negative pathogens isolated from cases of canine otitis externa in the presence of EDTA. Robenidine did not demonstrate antibiofilm activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. EDTA facilitated biofilm biomass degradation for both Gram-positives and Gram-negatives. The addition of robenidine to EDTA was not associated with any change in the effect on biofilm biomass degradation. The combination of robenidine with EDTA or PMBN has potential for further exploration and pharmaceutical development, such as incorporation into topical and otic formulations for animal and human use.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nThe widespread occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is problematic in both human and animal medicine (Morehead and Scarbrough, 2018). In particular, ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) deserve global attention due to the development of MDR (Santajit and Indrawattana, 2016) and increased mortality among patients (Pendleton et al., 2013). The other worrisome factor is the potential of bacteria to form biofilms that are extremely resistant to antimicrobials (Chambers and Deleo, 2009). In the past, resistance could be combated by the development of new drugs active against antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. However, the pharmaceutical industry has reduced its research efforts for the discovery and development of novel antibacterial drugs (Theuretzbacher et al., 2018). Adding to this global issue, the only novel antimicrobial classes that have been introduced in the last 20 years are the lipopeptides (daptomycin), oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid) and the lipoglycopeptides (dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin), which predominantly have a Gram-positive spectrum of activity (Wilcox, 2005; Saravolatz et al., 2009; Zhanel et al., 2012). The lack of novel antimicrobial development has resulted in attempts to safeguard critically important antimicrobials (antimicrobial stewardship) and a search for alternatives to treat MDR infections, including those in animals (Chan et al., 2018a; Hickey et al., 2018).\nThe use of critically important antimicrobials (WHO, 2017) for veterinary applications may also contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance. For example, MDR strains of P. aeruginosa (MDRPA) and methicillin-resistant strains of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus spp. and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., are now widespread in veterinary medicine, particularly as a cause of infections such as canine otitis, dermatitis and bovine mastitis (Beck et al., 2012; Abraham et al., 2017; Heward et al., 2018; Khazandi et al., 2018). Otitis externa is one of the most common infectious diseases in dogs, and it can be caused by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, as well as fungi. It is typically treated by topical administration of antimicrobials, such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones that are critically important for human medicine (Paterson, 2016). Otitis externa treatment failures are often due to the development of antimicrobial resistance in key target pathogens, for example methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and MDRPA (Martin Barrasa et al., 2000; Heward et al., 2018). Development of antimicrobial resistance in these companion animal pathogens is a potential public health concern with documented transmission of MDRPA and MRSP occurring between humans and dogs within households (Lozano et al., 2017; Fernandes et al., 2018).\nOne approach that promotes antimicrobial stewardship and minimizes the likelihood of cross-resistance development and transmission between different host species is the repurposing of existing drugs for new applications. For example, monensin and narasin (polyether ionophores used as anticoccidials in animals, but not in humans), and closantel (a salicylanilide anthelmintic) have both been shown to be active against MRSP and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (Rajamuthiah et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2018a,b; Hickey et al., 2018). Robenidine is licensed as an anticoccidial agent and has been used safely worldwide since the early 1970s for control of coccidiosis in poultry and rabbits (Kantor et al., 1970; Bampidis et al., 2019). Recently, our laboratory reported that robenidine had antimicrobial activity against MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but no activity against Gram-negative bacteria unless robenidine was tested in combination with sub-inhibitory concentrations of polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) (Abraham et al., 2016). The fact that robenidine only displays activity against Gram-negative organisms in the presence of PMBN is a good indication that robenidine acts on the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-negative organisms, but is unable to breach the permeability barrier of the outer membrane (OM) (Arzanlou et al., 2017) in the absence of a membrane permeabilizer.\nThe spectrum of activity of antimicrobial agents can be extended by combining them with adjuvants. Two such agents, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), were selected for further investigation in this study. EDTA is a prescription medicine in humans given intravenously or intramuscularly for the treatment of lead poisoning (Selander, 1969), and is a component of many topically applied ointments, eye drops and ear cleaners (Guardabassi et al., 2010). EDTA is a bacteriostatic compound that permeabilizes the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria by chelating Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations (Vaara, 1992). In addition, EDTA has demonstrated antibiofilm activities against existing biofilms as well as preventing biofilm formation (Finnegan and Percival, 2015). PMBN derived from polymyxin B, whilst lacking antibacterial activity (except against Pseudomonas spp.), is able to render Gram-negative bacteria more susceptible to antimicrobials by increasing their outer membrane permeability without affecting bacterial cell viability (Schneider et al., 2017). It has been reported that the combination of PMBN with novobiocin or erythromycin administered intraperitoneally successfully treated mice infected with Gram-negative pathogens (Ofek et al., 1994; Allam et al., 2017).\nOur aims in this study were to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of robenidine either alone or in the presence of EDTA or PMBN against Gram-negative bacteria predominantly associated with otitis externa of animals and skin infections of humans, and assess the activity of the most effective combination/s against field strains of canine otitis externa pathogens including P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, S. pseudintermedius and beta-haemolytic streptococci. We hypothesized that either EDTA or PMBN would increase the antimicrobial activity of robenidine against Gram-negative bacteria through outer membrane permeabilization.\n\n## Antimicrobial Agents\nAnalytical grade robenidine was provided by Neoculi Pty Ltd., Burwood, VIC, Australia. The compound was stored in a sealed container in the dark at 4\u00b0C at the Infectious Diseases Laboratory, Roseworthy campus, The University of Adelaide. Polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), ampicillin, apramycin, enrofloxacin, and gentamicin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Australia). Stock solutions (25.6 mg/ml of PMBN in DMSO, 12.8 mg/ml of ampicillin in PBS, 12.8 mg/ml of apramycin in DMSO, 3.2 mg/ml of enrofloxacin in \u00bd volume of water to which was added NaOH dropwise to facilitate dissolution and 12.8 mg/ml of gentamicin in Milli-Q water) were prepared and stored in 1 ml aliquots at -80\u00b0C. They were defrosted immediately prior to use. EDTA (disodium salt) was purchased from Chem-Supply Pty Ltd., South Australia and was dissolved in Milli-Q water to 200 mM.\n\n## Bacterial Strains\nEscherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 11229, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. aeruginosa PA01, Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17428, P. mirabilis ATCC 43071, K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, and A. baumannii ATCC 12457 were used for preliminary susceptibility testing and combination experiments. S. aureus ATCC 29213 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 were used as internal quality controls. A variety of bacterial organisms from both human and canine infections were investigated in this study (n = 119 isolates in total). Twenty-eight clinical Acinetobacter spp. isolates were obtained from cases of human skin and soft tissue infections, including 18 Acinetobacter baumannii and 10 A. calcoaceticus, kindly provided by Ms Jan Bell (Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, South Australia). It is notable that A. baumannii ST2 producing OXA-23 have been reported in both humans and animals, representing a possible zoonotic lineage (van der Kolk et al., 2019). Ninety-one clinical isolates were obtained from cases of canine otitis externa, including seven methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP), 13 multidrug- and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) (Saputra et al., 2017), 20 beta-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., 30 P. aeruginosa (10 of them resistant to gentamicin and 21 P. mirabilis isolates). These isolates were obtained from the bacterial collection of the national survey of antimicrobial resistance in animals conducted in Australia. Swab samples from dogs with signs of otitis externa were collected by veterinarians and submitted to government, private or university diagnostic laboratories throughout Australia. After routine bacterial identification and the removal of confidential information, the participating veterinary diagnostic laboratories submitted the bacteria and their clinical information to PC2 Laboratories, Australian Centre for Antimicrobial Resistance Ecology, School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, University of Adelaide, Roseworthy Campus, Roseworthy, SA, Australia, for further study. Thus, animal ethics approval was not required in this study. These organisms were identified to species level using biochemical testing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker, Preston, VIC, Australia).\n\n## Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing\nMinimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for robenidine, EDTA and PMBN in round bottom 96-well microtiter trays (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia), using the modified broth micro-dilution method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, 2015). Testing concentrations were as follows: robenidine- 256\u20130.25 \u03bcg/ml; EDTA- 3800\u201345 \u03bcg/ml; PMBN- 32\u20130.06 \u03bcg/ml. Luria Bertani (LB) broth (Oxoid, Australia) was applied for MIC testing in lieu of cation-adjusted Mueller\u2013Hinton broth as robenidine has been previously shown to chelate calcium ions. Furthermore, a twofold serial dilution of robenidine was performed in 100% DMSO, with 1 \u03bcl dispensed to each well due to the hydrophobicity of the compound (Abraham et al., 2016). The MIC for ampicillin or gentamicin against each isolate was determined for each test to serve as an internal quality control. The MICs of isolates were determined by visual reading and using an EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader 2300 atA600nm. MIC50, MIC90, and MIC range for robenidine and EDTA were calculated against clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis, S. pseudintermedius and \u03b2-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., MIC range and MIC mode were calculated for A. baumannii and A. calcoaceticus.\n\n## Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) Determination\nThe MBC of robenidine alone or in combination with EDTA or PMBN against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was determined. Briefly, 10 \u03bcl aliquots from each duplicate well from the MIC assays (starting from the MIC for each compound) were inoculated onto a sheep blood agar (SBA) plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Plates were examined at 24 separate intervals for a period of 2 days, the MBC was recorded as the lowest concentration of each test compound at which a 99.95% colony count reduction was observed on the plate (CLSI, 1999).\n\n## Synergy Testing by Checkerboard Microdilution, Isobolograms and Dose Reduction Analysis\nTo assess the potential activity of robenidine, MICs against a range of Gram-negative ATCC strains as well as clinical isolates of canine otitis externa pathogens were performed in the presence or absence of 23.2\u20137,500 \u03bcg/ml (0.06\u201320 mM) EDTA and 0.25\u2013128 \u03bcg/ml PMBN in a slightly modified standard checkerboard assay as described previously (Hwang et al., 2012). Briefly, antimicrobial stock solutions for robenidine and PMBN were prepared at a concentration of 12.8 mg/ml in DMSO. The antimicrobial stock solution for EDTA was prepared at a concentration of 200 mM in Milli-Q water. Then, a twofold serial dilution of each antimicrobial stock solution was prepared in its appropriate solvent (e.g., DMSO for robenidine and Milli-Q water for EDTA) from wells 12 to 3 (from 12.8 to 0.25 mg/ml for robenidine and PMBN; and 100 to 0.06 mM for EDTA). A 1 \u03bcl aliquot of the first compound from each combination was dispensed along the abscissa (from row A to G) of the 96-well microplate, while the second compound was dispensed along the ordinate (from column 12 to column 3) using an electronic multichannel pipette followed by 89 \u03bcl of LB broth. Each well of the plate was inoculated with an aliquot of 10 \u03bcl bacterial suspension at a concentration of 1-5 \u00d7 106 colony forming units (CFU) per ml. Subsequently, the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) described the results of the combinations, and was calculated utilizing the following formula:\nFIC A is the MIC of robenidine in the combination/MIC of robenidine alone, FIC B is the MIC of the adjuvant (EDTA or PMBN) in the combination/MIC of the adjuvant alone. The results indicate synergism when the corresponding FICI \u2264 0.5, additivity when 0.5 < FICI \u2264 1, indifference when 1 < FICI \u2264 4 and antagonism when the FICI > 4. In this study, the FIC for robenidine and PMBN against Gram-negative bacteria in the combination was calculated to be zero (e.g., 1 \u00f7 >256 = 0) when robenidine or PMBN did not show any antibacterial activity alone against Gram-negative bacteria at the highest concentration tested (e.g., 256 \u03bcg/ml), but antimicrobial activity was observed when the compounds were tested in combination.\nThe results of the checkerboard experiments are illustrated by isobolograms, as follows: The MIC of drug A is marked on the x-axis of an isobologram and the MIC of drug B on the y-axis, with the line connecting the two marks representing the indifferent line (no interaction) (Tallarida, 2006). The MIC values of the combination located below the indifference line indicate additive (1 \u2265 FICI > 0.5) or synergistic (FICI \u2264 0.5) interactions. Values that are found above the indifferent line indicate indifferent (1 < FICI \u2264 4) or antagonistic (FICI > 4) interactions (Hwang et al., 2012).\nThe dose reduction index (DRI) shows the difference between the effective doses in combination in comparison to its individual dose. DRI was calculated as follows:\nRobenidine and PMBN did not show any antimicrobial activity against the majority of Gram-negative bacteria tested, the highest concentration of each compound tested against each isolate was included in the DRI equation as its MIC [e.g., the MIC of robenidine alone against E. coli was >256 (\u03bcg/ml) and its MIC in combination with EDTA was 1 (\u03bcg/ml); DRI = 256/1].\nDose reduction indices is very important clinically when the dose reduction is associated with a toxicity reduction without changing efficacy (Eid et al., 2012). Commonly, a DRI higher than 1 is considered beneficial.\n\n## Time-Dependent Killing Assays\nTime kill assays were performed (in duplicate) for the robenidine \u00b1 EDTA assays as described previously (CLSI, 1999) with slight modifications. Briefly, colonies of each bacterium (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. aeruginosa PA01, a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa from canine otitis externa, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, human clinical isolates of A. baumannii B10 and A. baumannii B11) from overnight SBA plates were separately emulsified in normal sterile saline and adjusted to A600nm = 0.10 (equivalent to approximately 5 \u00d7 107 CFU/ml). Subsequently, the bacterial suspensions were further diluted 1:10 in sterile saline. The robenidine or EDTA were serially diluted in 100% DMSO or Milli-Q water at 100\u00d7 the final desired concentration and a 100 \u03bcl aliquot of appropriate concentrations added to each 10 ml preparation. Robenidine or EDTA solution was prepared in 10 ml volumes at MIC and 2\u00d7 MIC concentration in LB broth. After adding inoculum dose to each tube, duplicate cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C, with samples withdrawn at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h, serially diluted tenfold and plated on SBA overnight at 37\u00b0C for bacterial enumeration. According to CLSI, an antimicrobial agent is considered bactericidal if it causes a \u22653 \u00d7 log10 (99.95%) reduction in CFU/ml after 18\u201324 h of incubation, and the combination is considered synergistic when it causes a \u22652 \u00d7 log10 reduction in CFU/ml (T\u00e4ngd\u00e9n et al., 2014).\n\n## Antibiofilm Susceptibility Testing\nThe minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was determined for robenidine and EDTA using the MBECTM High-throughput assay system (MBECTM BioProducts, Innovotech, Canada) consisting of a lid with 96 pegs and a 96-well microtiter plate as previously described (Ceri et al., 2001; Harrison et al., 2010). Briefly, biofilms of P. aeruginosa PA01, two clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa isolates and two clinical isolates of S. pseudintermedius were formed by inoculating 150 \u03bcl of 107 CFU/ml of each bacterial suspension in the MBECTM device. The inoculated device was aerobically incubated on an orbital shaker at 37\u00b0C (OM11, Ratek Instruments Pty Ltd., Australia) for 24 h to produce equivalent (Uniform) biofilms on all pegs. Biofilms of P. aeruginosa and S. pseudintermedius were exposed to challenge plates containing a serial concentration of robenidine (from 0.125 to 128 \u03bcg/ml) or EDTA (1\u201332 mM) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Following antimicrobial challenge, the biofilms were rinsed twice with phosphate buffered saline (pH = 7) and disrupted via sonication (Soniclean, Model 160TD, Australia) for 10 min into the recovery medium. Viable cell counts were determined for recovered cells (colony-forming units per peg) after preparing a serial dilution and plating 10 \u03bcl in duplicates of each dilution onto plate count agar. Viable counts were then expressed as a percentage of the mean CFU of growth controls. MBEC was defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that eradicates the biofilms recovered from the antimicrobial challenge.\n\n## Checkerboard Microdilution Assay for Antibiofilm Activity of Robenidine\nA slightly modified standard checkerboard assay was used to determine the activity of robenidine in the presence or absence of 37.2\u201312,000 \u03bcg/ml (1\u201332 mM) EDTA as described previously (Hwang et al., 2012). Briefly, the MBECTM High-throughput assay system (MBECTM BioProducts, Innovotech, Canada) was used for the preparation of Gram-positive and Gram-negative biofilm producing bacteria as described above for antibiofilm susceptibility testing. The antimicrobial stock solution for EDTA was prepared at a concentration of 128 mM in Milli-Q water and robenidine was prepared at 12.8 mg/ml in DMSO. Then, a twofold serial dilution of each antimicrobial stock solution was prepared in its appropriate solvent from wells 12 to 3 (from 12.8 to 0.25 mg/ml for robenidine and 128 to 1 mM for EDTA). A 2 \u03bcl aliquot of robenidine compound from each concentration was dispensed along the abscissa (from row A to H) of the 96-well microplate, while 100 \u03bcl of EDTA was dispensed along the ordinate (from column 12 to column 3) using an electronic multichannel pipette followed by 98 \u03bcl of LB broth. Subsequently, the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.\n\nA panel of adherent mammalian cell lines, HaCat (human immortalized keratinocytes), HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) and MDCK (normal Madin Darby Canine Kidney) were assayed for in vitro cytotoxicity of robenidine alone or in combination with EDTA or PMBN. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% PenStrep (100 U/mL Penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL Streptomycin) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Cells were serially passaged at \u223c80% confluence \u223c every 4 days. Assays were performed in duplicate in 96 well plates seeded with \u223c25,000 cells per well. After 24 h, media was removed, washed once with medium without antimicrobials and replaced with fresh media to which robenidine in the presence or absence of EDTA and PMBN were added same concentrations used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Briefly, the antimicrobials were prepared by performing a twofold serial dilution at 100\u00d7 of tested concentration in DMSO. Subsequently, a 1 \u03bcl aliquot of each concentration was transferred to a sterile 96-well plate containing fresh DMEM with either 10% FBS. After mixing four times, the media aliquots with different concentrations of antimicrobial were transferred to each well of the 96-well plate seeded with cells, using wells containing 1\u20132% DMSO only as control. To determine the effect of FBS on the cytotoxicity of each compound, DMEM with 40% FBS containing different concentrations of antimicrobial was prepared as described above. After 24 h of exposure, WST-1 reagent (Cell Proliferation Assay reagent, Roche) at a concentration of 10% was added to each well. Absorbance at A450 nm on a Multiskan Ascent 354 Spectrophotometer (Labsystems) was measured after 1 h of incubation. The IC50 value was determined for each compound against each cell line via non-linear regression (three parameters) using GraphPad Prism v6 software.\n\n## Antimicrobial Activity of Robenidine Against Gram-Negative Control Strains\nRobenidine did not demonstrate any antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative control strains (E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 11229, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. mirabilis ATCC 43071 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883) at the highest concentrations (256 \u03bcg/ml) tested except for A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (32 \u03bcg/ml) and A. baumannii ATCC 12457 (64 \u03bcg/ml).\n\n## Antimicrobial Activity of Robenidine Against Human Clinical \nThe MIC results of robenidine against A. baumannii and A. calcoaceticus isolated from human clinical cases were demonstrated at concentrations ranging from 8 to 64 \u03bcg/ml (MIC mode = 8 \u03bcg/ml) for 18 A. baumannii and 1\u20138 \u03bcg/ml (MIC mode = 2 \u03bcg/ml) for 10 A. calcoaceticus. The ratio of MBC/MIC values for both Acinetobacter spp. was either 2\u00d7 or 4\u00d7 their MICs.\n\n## Combination of Robenidine With EDTA or PMBN Against Gram-Negative Control Strains\nThe presence of EDTA in combination with robenidine was associated with a notable increase in the potency and spectrum of activity against Gram-negative control strains. The results of MIC and DRI values for the combination of robenidine and EDTA against E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 11229, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. mirabilis ATCC 43071, K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, and A. baumannii ATCC 12457 are presented in Table 1. The combination of robenidine and EDTA resulted in a synergistic interaction against the standard isolates of E. coli as well as against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. putida ATCC 17428, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883. An additive/indifferent interaction was recorded against P. mirabilis, A. baumannii, and A. calcoaceticus control strains. DRIs of robenidine were significantly increased in the presence of EDTA from 2- to 256-fold (Table 1).\nThe results of MIC, FICI, and DRI values for the combination of robenidine and PMBN against E. coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 11229, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. mirabilis ATCC 43071, K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, and A. baumannii ATCC 12457 are presented in Table 2. The combination of robenidine and PMBN resulted in a synergistic interaction against all the isolates tested except P. mirabilis ATCC 43071 (Table 2). DRIs of robenidine were significantly increased in the presence of PMBN from 8- to 256-fold (Table 2).\nIsobologram analyses were carried out for the combination of EDTA and robenidine against E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and P. mirabilis ATCC 43071, and for the combination of PMBN and robenidine against E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Dose-effect curves for drugs with different maxima and the corresponding isobole combination are presented in Figure 1. Isoboles of the combination of EDTA and robenidine against E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 indicated synergism. Similarly, isoboles of the combination of PMBN and robenidine against E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 also indicated synergism.\n\n## Antimicrobial Activity of Robenidine Against Canine Otitis Externa Pathogens\nMIC range, MIC50, MIC90 (\u03bcg/ml) values of robenidine, gentamicin, apramycin, and ampicillin against quality control strains (S. aureus ATCC 29213, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, E. coli ATCC 25922) and clinical isolates from otitis externa cases in dogs [S. pseudintermedius (n = 20), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 20), P. mirabilis (n = 21), and P. aeruginosa (n = 30)] are presented in Table 3.\n\n## Combination of Robenidine With EDTA Against Canine Otitis Externa Pathogens\nMinimum inhibitory concentrations and DRI values for the combination of robenidine and EDTA against 30 P. aeruginosa, 21 P. mirabilis, 20 S. pseudintermedius, and 20 beta-haemolytic streptococci isolated from canine otitis externa cases are shown in Table 4. The clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa including 10 antimicrobial-resistant isolates, showed a synergistic interaction with the combination of robenidine and EDTA. An additivity interaction (95.3%) was recorded against clinical isolates of P. mirabilis in the combination of robenidine and EDTA. The DRIs of robenidine for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis isolates increased between 64- and 2048-fold, and the DRIs of EDTA increased two and fourfold. Additionally, additive and indifferent activity of the combination robenidine and EDTA was observed against clinical isolates of MRSP, MSSP and beta-haemolytic streptococci.\nRobenidine demonstrated antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values ranging from 1 to 16 \u03bcg/ml against S. pseudintermedius and beta-haemolytic streptococci, respectively. The lowest level of interaction was recorded for the combination of robenidine and EDTA against S. pseudintermedius and beta-haemolytic streptococci. However, the dose reduction for beta-haemolytic streptococci ranged from 2- to 16-fold for robenidine and twofold for EDTA.\n\n## Time Kill Kinetics of Drug Combinations Against \nTime kill curves for robenidine in the presence of EDTA at the concentration of MIC90 (2 \u03bcg/ml robenidine + 1,500 \u03bcg/ml or 4 mM of EDTA) and 2\u00d7 MIC90 (4 \u03bcg/ml robenidine + 3,000 \u03bcg/ml or 8 mM of EDTA) were obtained for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. aeruginosa PA01 and a clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa from a canine otitis externa case are presented in Figure 2A\u2013C. The combination of robenidine and EDTA at MIC90 significantly reduced the colony count of P. aeruginosa isolates (about 3 log10) over 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h with a synergistic effect in comparison to the control growth and EDTA alone. However, at 24 h, bacterial regrowth was observed to almost the same level as the sample treated with EDTA alone. Further reductions of the bacteria (greater than 5 log10 CFU/ml reduction) at 0.5 h were recorded when the EDTA concentration increased from MIC90 (3,000 \u03bcg/ml or 4 mM) to 2\u00d7 MIC90 (3,000 \u03bcg/ml or 8 mM) in comparison to control and EDTA alone. A minimum of a 5 log10 reduction was still evident at 4 h incubation, however, after 24 h the numbers of bacteria present had increased. However, this reduction (approximately 5 log10 reduction) remained consistent in comparison to growth control.\nTime kill curves for robenidine in the presence of EDTA at the concentration of MIC (4 \u03bcg/ml robenidine + 188 \u03bcg/ml or 0.5 mM of EDTA) and 2\u00d7 MIC (8 \u03bcg/ml robenidine + 376 \u03bcg/ml or 1 mM of EDTA) for A. baumannii ATCC 19606, two human clinical isolates of A. baumannii (B10 and B11) from canine otitis externa are presented in Figure 2D\u2013F. The combination of robenidine and EDTA at both MIC and 2\u00d7 MIC significantly reduced the colony counts of A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and two clinical isolates of A. baumannii over 1 and 2 h with a synergistic effect in comparison to the control growth and EDTA alone. After 8 and 4 h, bacteria were eliminated for tested isolates in both MIC and 2\u00d7 MIC, respectively.\n\n## Antibiofilm Activity of Robenidine Alone and in the Presence of EDTA\nPreformed biofilms of P. aeruginosa PA01, two clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and two clinical isolates of S. pseudintermedius were tested against robenidine and EDTA to determine their activities. Robenidine at concentration of up to 128 \u03bcg/ml did not show any antibiofilm activity against P. aeruginosa and S. pseudintermedius isolates in comparison to enrofloxacin as a positive control (Figure 3A,B). However, 1 mM concentration of EDTA demonstrated a significantly effect in disrupting the 24 h preformed biofilms in comparison to growth control against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Figure 3C). EDTA was more effective against the biofilms when the concentration of EDTA increased to 16 mM. However, the presence of robenidine in combination with EDTA was not associated with any change in the antibiofilm activity of EDTA against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The results of the antibiofilm activity of the EDTA in the present of robenidine against P. aeruginosa PA01 are shown in Figure 3D.\n\n## Robenidine Cytotoxicity to Mammalian Cell Lines\nThe cytotoxicity profile of robenidine in the presence and absence of EDTA and PMBN was evaluated in a panel of different cultured mammalian cells using the WST-1 Cell Proliferation Assay reagent (Roche). The results of the in vitro cytotoxicity measurements show IC50 values of 12 \u03bcg/ml for robenidine, IC50 values of 3.4 mM for EDTA, while PMBN gave IC50 values of >32 \u03bcg/ml against all the cell lines tested (Table 5). We found that the in vitro cytotoxicity measurements show IC50 values of 12 \u03bcg/ml for robenidine in the presence of either 3.4 mM for EDTA or 32 \u03bcg/ml for PMBN (Table 5).
