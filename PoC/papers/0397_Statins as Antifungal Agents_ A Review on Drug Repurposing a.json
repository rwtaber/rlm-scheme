The rising prevalence of antifungal resistance and virulence factors of Candida albicans underscore the limitations of current therapies. Statins, commonly used as lipid-lowering agents, have emerged as attractive repurposed drug candidates due to their ability to interfere with fungal ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras-mediated signaling pathways.

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nFungal infections remain a pressing global health challenge, particularly among immunocompromised populations [1]. Members of the genus Candida account for approximately 80% of all fungal infections worldwide and represent a leading cause of opportunistic mycoses [2, 3]. While \nCandida albicans\n is the most frequently isolated species, non\u2010albicans species, including \nCandida glabrata\n, \nCandida parapsilosis\n, \nCandida tropicalis\n, \nCandida krusei\n, and the emerging multidrug\u2010resistant \nCandida auris\n, are gaining clinical significance due to rising resistance to frontline antifungal classes [4, 5]. Reflecting this growing concern, in 2022 the World Health Organization designated \nC.\u2009albicans\n as one of only four fungal pathogens classified as a \u201ccritical threat\u201d to public health [6]. Clinically, \nC.\u2009albicans\n infections, collectively referred to as candidiasis, can manifest as mucosal infections affecting the oral cavity, esophagus, or genital tract, with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) ranking among the most prevalent mucosal forms. VVC affects an estimated 138 million women annually worldwide and is characterized by a high recurrence rate, substantially impairing quality of life [7, 8].\nThe standard management of mucosal candidiasis relies primarily on azole antifungals, with polyenes used less frequently and typically administered either orally or topically [9]. However, these therapeutic options are constrained by the limited number of available antifungal agents, treatment\u2010associated adverse effects, and the escalating problem of drug resistance [10, 11]. The rise in antifungal resistance, driven in part by empirical prescribing practices, underscores the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies and strengthened antifungal stewardship [12, 13]. Consequently, the development of alternative interventions has become a global health priority. Yet, the conventional pathway for novel drug discovery, development, and regulatory approval can span approximately 15\u2009years, rendering it inadequate to address the immediate and growing clinical demands posed by resistant Candida infections [14, 15].\nWithin this context, drug repurposing has emerged as a compelling and pragmatic strategy, leveraging agents with well\u2010established safety and efficacy profiles to shorten development timelines and reduce costs [16]. Among the pharmacological classes under investigation, statins, widely prescribed for the management of hypercholesterolemia, have demonstrated notable antifungal potential and are being repurposed for the treatment of candidiasis [17]. Statins act as inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl\u2010CoA (HMG\u2010CoA) reductase, and their antimicrobial activity is thought to stem from the inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis, thereby disrupting key processes in fungal physiology, including ergosterol biosynthesis, modulation of G\u2010protein signaling, and activation of Ras\u2010dependent pathways [18, 19].\nAnother promising avenue to address the current therapeutic limitations is the development of advanced pharmaceutical formulations capable of improving the delivery and performance of antifungal agents. Formulation strategies such as polymeric films [20] and in\u00a0situ gel [21] can improve local drug concentrations and sustain therapeutic activity. More broadly, advanced drug delivery platforms can improve solubility [22], stability [23], bioavailability [24], and site\u2010specific targeting [25], ultimately increasing treatment efficacy while minimizing systemic exposure. Among these, nanotechnology\u2010based approaches have transformed the field by enabling the engineering of nanoscale carriers capable of entrapping, encapsulating, dissolving, or binding active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) within their matrix [26].\nA wide range of nanosystems has been investigated, including lipid\u2010based nanoparticles, such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), as well as polymeric nanoparticles [27]. Liposomes, composed of phospholipid bilayers surrounding an aqueous core, can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules while offering biocompatibility, biodegradability, and protection against enzymatic degradation [28]. SLNs, characterized by a solid lipid core stabilized with surfactants, provide high stability, reproducibility, and scalability, whereas NLCs, incorporating both solid and liquid lipids, improve drug loading, stability, and release control [29].Polymeric nanoparticles, such as those fabricated from polylactic\u2010co\u2010glycolic acid (PLGA), enable controlled and sustained drug release, with architectures that can be tuned as nanospheres or nanocapsules depending on polymer arrangement [30]. Particularly relevant for mucosal delivery, chitosan\u2010based nanoparticles, derived from the deacetylation of chitin, combine low toxicity, biocompatibility, and intrinsic antimicrobial properties with strong mucoadhesive capacity, thereby prolonging retention at the site of infection and facilitating localized drug release [31].\nBuilding on this context, the present review examines innovative strategies for the treatment of mucosal candidiasis, with particular emphasis on drug repurposing and the potential of statins as antifungal agents. Furthermore, it discusses advanced formulations and nanotechnology\u2010driven delivery systems as approaches to enhance the therapeutic performance of statins in this setting, drawing on recent evidence from the literature.\n\n## \nC.\u2009albicans\n\nThe Candida genus is the primary group of yeasts responsible for causing opportunistic infections in humans [32]. Approximately 200 Candida species are documented in the literature, with 20 known to cause infections in humans [33, 34]. The main opportunistic species found in healthy individuals include \nC.\u2009albicans\n, \nC.\u2009glabrata\n, \nC.\u2009tropicalis\n, \nC.\u2009parapsilosis\n, and \nC.\u2009krusei\n [35]. These species can be present symbiotically in the oral, gastrointestinal, and urogenital microbiota of 50%\u201370% of healthy people [36, 37].\nAmong Candida species, \nC.\u2009albicans\n stands out as the primary opportunistic pathogen. This dimorphic fungus transitions from yeast to hyphal form under pathogenic conditions, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [38]. This polymorphic species exhibits significant versatility in transforming from a harmless commensal microorganism into a pathogen due to its virulence factors, making it one of the most common species causing candidiasis [39]. The primary virulence factors of \nC.\u2009albicans\n include adherence to host cells, morphogenesis, and the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes that damage tissues [40]. Morphogenesis, in particular, is crucial for pathogenicity, as \nC.\u2009albicans\n adheres to host cells as yeast and invades tissues as hyphae [41]. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus can enhance the action of these virulence factors. Also, elevated blood glucose levels activate enzymes like aspartyl protease (Sap), phospholipases, and candidalysin, which destabilize cell membranes, promoting cell lysis and tissue penetration [42].\nFactors such as a limited antifungal spectrum, irrational use of antimicrobials, and prolonged ICU stays are correlated with an increase in invasive candidiasis and fungal resistance [43]. Fungal resistance in \nC.\u2009albicans\n is multifaceted, involving several mechanisms such as biofilm formation, mitotic mutations, and genetic recombination. Biofilms act as protective barriers, significantly enhancing fungal resistance by shielding Candida species from conventional antifungal agents [44, 45]. Furthermore, mutations in the ERG11 gene, which encodes the essential enzyme 14\u03b1\u2010demethylase (Erg11p) for ergosterol biosynthesis, along with overexpression of ergosterol in the plasma membrane, further contribute to antifungal resistance [2, 46].\nMoreover, mutations in the ERG11 gene reduce the affinity of Erg11p for fluconazole, complicating the treatment of candidiasis [47, 48]. Moreover, the activation of efflux pumps and loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations in the ERG3 gene, which encodes the enzyme C\u20105 sterol desaturase, lead to ergosterol depletion and the accumulation of alternative sterols. These changes contribute to cross\u2010resistance to both azoles and polyenes [49].\n\n## VVC\nVVC is an acute inflammatory condition caused by the overgrowth of Candida species, significantly impacting the quality of life for many women of reproductive age [50, 51]. Key symptoms include pruritus, abnormal vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and external dysuria [52]. Factors that can induce VVC encompass immunosuppression, genetic polymorphisms, allergies, use of antibiotics and glucocorticoids, pregnancy, stress, sexual activity, and uncontrolled diabetes [53, 54].\nVVC is generally classified into uncomplicated and complicated cases. Uncomplicated VVC presents as mild, sporadic infections with moderate symptoms. In contrast, complicated cases, such as recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), VVC during pregnancy, or VVC associated with underlying conditions like immunosuppression and diabetes, are more severe. It is estimated that 10%\u201320% of women experience complications requiring specialized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches [55, 56]. Differentiating between VVC and RVVC is crucial for selecting the most effective treatment [57]. RVVC is defined as three or more symptomatic episodes within 12\u2009months, with \nC.\u2009albicans\n being the causative agent in at least three\u2010quarters of these cases\u00a0[58].\nThe diagnosis of VVC typically involves clinical examination, microscopy of vaginal fluid, and mycological culture [59]. Observing budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae is crucial for confirming VVC [60]. While mycological culture is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, its analysis time of 48\u201372\u2009h can delay results, making it less practical for rapid diagnosis [61]. Consequently, diagnosis often relies on clinical symptoms, which can be imprecise and have low specificity, leading to a 50% rate of diagnostic imprecision [62]. This empirical approach can result in inappropriate antifungal prescriptions, contributing to increased resistance and recurrent [63].\nTreatment of VVC can involve topical, oral, or combined therapies depending on whether the case is complicated or uncomplicated [56]. Azole antifungals (Figure\u00a01) are the first\u2010line treatment options [64]. Topical azoles include clotrimazole, miconazole, tioconazole, butoconazole, and terconazole, while oral options approved by the FDA are fluconazole, itraconazole, and oteseconazole [65]. These drugs act by inhibiting lanosterol 14\u2010alpha demethylase, a key enzyme in ergosterol synthesis, which is essential for fungal cell wall formation [66]. However, orally administered azoles can have adverse effects, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal disorders, and neurological disorders [67]. Fluconazole, the most commonly used drug, has limitations such as contraindication during pregnancy, in\u00a0vitro resistance in \nC.\u2009albicans\n, and potential to promote resistance in non\u2010albicans species, leading to further complications [68].\nAnother class of antifungal agents used in the treatment of VVC is polyenes, including amphotericin B and nystatin (Figure\u00a02). Polyenes exert fungistatic and fungicidal effects by increasing the permeability of the fungal cell membrane [69]. They achieve this by binding to ergosterol, which disrupts membrane integrity and causes the leakage of essential ions, such as sodium and potassium, as well as sugars, leading to fungal cell death [70].\nAlthough various treatments are available, managing VVC remains challenging, primarily due to the growing resistance of Candida species to commonly used antifungal agents. Notably, recent studies report a rising prevalence of resistance, particularly against azole antifungals like fluconazole, widely regarded as a first\u2010line therapy [70]. Furthermore, non\u2010albicans Candida species, which are often less responsive to azoles, have been increasingly implicated in VVC cases. This shift in fungal epidemiology is exacerbated by the overuse and misuse of antifungals, contributing to a broader resistance problem\u00a0[71] Recent findings also underscore the emergence of multidrug\u2010resistant strains, making effective treatment even more difficult [6]. The increasing trends in antifungal resistance underscore the urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches and improved stewardship practices to enhance the management of VVC and curb the progression of resistance [72].\n\n## Oral Candidiasis (OC) [\nOC, also known as oropharyngeal candidiasis, is a fungal infection caused by Candida species that affects the oral cavity [73]. The primary opportunistic pathogen responsible for OC is \nC.\u2009albicans\n, accounting for approximately 95% of diagnosed cases. This prevalence is due to \nC.\u2009albicans\n being a commensal organism in the oral cavity of healthy individuals, with around 80% of the population being asymptomatic carriers [74]. Commonly referred to as thrush, OC is characterized by symptoms such as dysphagia, pain, and changes in taste, and can affect various parts of the oral and buccal mucosa, including the palate, gums, tongue, and oropharynx [75].\nOC presents in several clinical forms: acute candidiasis (erythematous and pseudomembranous types), chronic candidiasis (erythematous and hyperplastic types), and angular cheilitis (linear gingival erythema and median rhomboid glossitis) [76, 77]. Pseudomembranous candidiasis is marked by white, creamy plaques that are difficult to remove and cause a burning sensation. Erythematous candidiasis features red patches with burning sensations, hyperplastic candidiasis presents as asymptomatic white plaques, and angular cheilitis is characterized by fissured red patches with sores [78].\nDiagnosis of OC involves a comprehensive clinical examination and microbiological investigations. Laboratory tests typically include histology with periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) staining and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PAS staining helps identify \nC.\u2009albicans\n hyphae, providing confirmation of the infection [79, 80].\nAlthough OC has a low lethality rate, if left untreated, it can progress to a chronic form and potentially lead to systemic candidiasis [81]. Treatment usually involves topical antifungal agents due to their effectiveness and minimal adverse effects [82]. The most commonly used topical antifungals for initial treatment include miconazole, clotrimazole, and nystatin, with nystatin being the most frequently prescribed [83]. For patients intolerant to or inadequately responsive to topical treatments, oral antifungals such as fluconazole, itraconazole, and miconazole are recommended [84].\n\n## Esophageal Candidiasis (EPC)\nEPC is an infectious disease that primarily affects patients with chronic illnesses and those who are immunosuppressed, such as individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), organ transplant recipients, or those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. It targets the esophagus, which is the second most susceptible site for infection in the gastrointestinal tract, following the oropharynx [85]. Patients undergoing cancer treatment are also at increased risk of EPC due to factors such as neutropenia, mucosal lesions, antibiotic use, and prolonged corticosteroid therapy [86].\nEPC is predominantly caused by \nC.\u2009albicans\n and is more frequently observed in patients with carcinoma compared to those with esophagitis [87]. The clinical manifestations include dysphagia, odynophagia, dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting [88]. Diagnosis is typically straightforward, with endoscopy being the primary diagnostic procedure. \nC.\u2009albicans\n hyphae can be visualized in the squamous epithelium using hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining. For more precise confirmation, special stains such as Gomori Methenamine Silver and Periodic Acid\u2010Schiff can be employed [89].\nTreatment options include both oral and intravenous antifungal therapies. Oral fluconazole, at a dosage of 200\u2013400\u2009mg daily for 14\u201321\u2009days, is the most commonly prescribed treatment [85].\n\n## Drug Repurposing Strategies\nThe development of new antifungal drugs targeting resistance mechanisms has become a global necessity. However, the time required to develop and register new drugs falls short of meeting current demands [15]. The drug development process is time\u2010intensive and costly, comprising four key stages: drug discovery and synthesis, preclinical studies, clinical trials, and post\u2010marketing safety monitoring. Completing these stages can take approximately 12\u201317\u2009years [14].\nIn this context, drug repurposing presents a promising solution to current challenges. Also known as repurposing, this strategy involves identifying new therapeutic uses for an existing API that is already marketed for its primary therapeutic action [90]. One of the main goals of drug repurposing is to shorten the research timeline for discovering new molecules by approximately 50%\u201360% by utilizing chemically well\u2010characterized and biologically safe molecules [91]. Pharmaceutical companies support this approach as it can reduce costs and optimize profit margins [92].\nCurrently, computational chemistry and bioinformatics are essential tools for enabling in silico screening of chemical structures and identifying potential new therapeutic targets. These tools facilitate the selection of substances for subsequent in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo repurposing tests [93]. Key methodologies include (1) structure\u2010based approaches such as molecular docking, structural similarity of binding sites, and receptor\u2010based pharmacophores; (2) expression\u2010based approaches including drug\u2010disease and drug\u2013drug network expression profiles and similarities; and (3) ligand\u2010based approaches like similarity searches, side effect similarities, QSAR, and machine learning [94].\nIn the literature, several examples of successful drug repurposing can be highlighted: sildenafil, originally researched as an antihypertensive, was repurposed for erectile dysfunction [95]. Metformin, used for treating diabetes mellitus, has been repurposed for colorectal, prostate, ovarian, and breast cancer [96, 97]. Additionally, Ferreira et\u00a0al. [98] suggested the potential repurposing of the anti\u2010inflammatory drug indomethacin for melanoma, based on published data.\nThe repurposing of drugs for antimicrobial use is of particular interest due to increasing fungal and bacterial resistance, as well as the recent COVID\u201019 pandemic, which has spurred the scientific community to explore potential treatments for future pandemics [99, 100]. Ribeiro et\u00a0al. [101] describe the repurposing of atorvastatin as an anticryptococcal agent. Blaskovich et\u00a0al. [102] reported the repurposing of cannabidiol, known for its antiepileptic potential, against gram\u2010negative bacilli (GNB), where it demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting and eradicating biofilms.\nThe strategy of repurposing drugs for treating fungal diseases is well\u2010documented in the literature and is gaining increasing attention within the scientific community. A study by Lei et\u00a0al. [103] evaluated the antifungal activity of vitamin D3 (VD3) against various Candida species. In\u00a0vitro assays confirmed that VD3 inhibited the growth of Candida spp. in a broad\u2010spectrum, dose\u2010dependent manner and demonstrated a significant antifungal effect during the biofilm formation stages of \nC.\u2009albicans\n.\nTricyclic antidepressants and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are also recognized in the literature for their antifungal properties\u00a0[104]. A study involving three tricyclic antidepressants, doxepin, imipramine, and nortriptyline, demonstrated through in\u00a0vitro assays that this class of drugs can inhibit hyphae and biofilm formation and also kill cells within mature biofilms in \nC.\u2009albicans\n species [44]. Regarding SSRIs, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline were tested against fluconazole\u2010resistant Candida spp. These drugs exhibited a wide range of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs): 20\u2013160\u2009\u03bcg/mL for fluoxetine, 10\u201320\u2009\u03bcg/mL for sertraline, and 10\u2013100.8\u2009\u03bcg/mL for paroxetine. They induced fungal apoptosis by damaging the mitochondrial membrane, with fluoxetine notably reducing the mature biofilm in all tested species [105].\nSSRIs have been documented in the literature both as standalone treatments and in combination with conventional antifungal drugs like fluconazole to explore synergistic effects. For instance, fluoxetine combined with fluconazole was tested on 29 Candida strains isolated from patients with VVC, showing synergistic activity against six strains. The MIC of fluconazole for resistant strains decreased by up to 64\u2010fold when the drugs were used in combination [106]. Additionally, studies have explored azole synergism with sertraline. Rodrigues et\u00a0al. [45], evaluated the association of sertraline with fluconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B in both planktonic and biofilm cells. Sertraline demonstrated a fungicidal effect, showing 93.75% synergy with fluconazole, 37.5% additive effects, and 25% synergy with itraconazole. Additionally, it exhibited 43.75% additive effects with amphotericin B. Furthermore, sertraline inhibited 85% of biofilm formation and maturation, with all effective concentrations remaining within safe ranges.\n\n## Repurposing Statins for Antifungal Therapy\nStatins, first discovered in the 1970s, have become essential in clinical practice for managing hyperlipidemia and reducing cardiovascular risk [107]. Commonly used statins include atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (Figure\u00a03). These drugs function by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG\u2010CoA) reductase, a crucial enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. In addition to their primary role in lowering LDL cholesterol, statins have demonstrated potential in various off\u2010label applications, such as anti\u2010inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, which continue to drive research into their expanded therapeutic uses [108, 109].\nMoreover, statins exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiparasitic, antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal potential [110, 111, 112, 113]. Although the exact mechanism of their antifungal action remains unclear, studies suggest that statins may exert their effects through various pathways. These include inhibiting ergosterol synthesis in fungal cells by blocking HMG\u2010CoA reductase, interfering with protein prenylation and function, disrupting mitochondrial function and inducing apoptosis, and affecting fungal cell morphogenesis and reproduction [114]. Figure\u00a04 illustrates the potential mechanisms of antifungal action of atorvastatin (ATV). Studies suggest that this statin may exert its antifungal effects through various mechanisms, contributing to its significant activity against different Candida strains, particularly \nC.\u2009albicans\n [115].\nBy inhibiting HMG\u2010CoA reductase, statins lead to a reduction in the levels of mevalonate and farnesyl pyrophosphate in fungal cells, thereby influencing various processes regulated by these compounds. This includes the inhibition of isoprenylation, which affects the translation of proteins related to the regulation of cell growth, specialization, and programmed cell death, as well as negatively impacting the activation of essential cellular proteins, such as those involved in respiration and iron metabolism [116, 117].\nExtensive studies suggest that statins may impact not only ergosterol synthesis but also other cellular targets, including mitochondrial function and the apoptosis cascade. Ajdidi et\u00a0al. [118] demonstrated that statins inhibit the growth of clinically relevant fungi such as \nAspergillus fumigatus\n and \nC.\u2009albicans\n. Furthermore, the study reported that prolonged exposure of \nC.\u2009glabrata\n cells to statins increases the proportion of small mutations, suggesting a potential effect on mitochondrial DNA integrity. Additionally, Roze et\u00a0al. [119] found that lovastatin induces cell death resembling apoptosis in Mucor racemosus. Lovastatin halts sporangiospore germination, reduces cell growth, and causes loss of viability characterized by cell shrinkage, increased density, and cytoplasmic condensation. It also triggers DNA fragmentation, resulting in the formation of nucleosomes and multimers.\nBellanger et\u00a0al. [120] investigated the effects of lovastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin on Rhizopus oryzae and observed DNA fragmentation and a reduction in spore germination. They also reported that exposure to lovastatin resulted in macroscopic melanin loss and diminished virulence in mucormycosis models using flies and mice. Similarly, Bocate et\u00a0al. [121] demonstrated that simvastatin effectively controlled the growth of toxigenic Aspergillus species, reducing biofilm production and indicating potential as an antifungal agent. Additionally, statins may stimulate farnesol\u2010dependent pathogenicity factors, such as the transition from yeast to hyphae and biofilm formation, which are key resistance mechanisms in fungi [115].\nFocusing specifically on the antifungal activity of statins against candidiasis, Esfahani et\u00a0al. [122] observed that ATV was effective against all tested \nC.\u2009albicans\n strains, while these strains were resistant to fluconazole and nystatin, underscoring ATV's potential as an antifungal agent. ATV also demonstrated significant antifungal activity against various Candida species, with notable selectivity for \nC.\u2009albicans\n, including strains resistant to fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole, with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 16 to 32\u2009\u03bcg/mL [19]. Ajdidi et\u00a0al. [118] evaluated the antifungal efficacy of ATV both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, finding that ATV reduced \nC.\u2009albicans\n growth by 74.6% within 24\u2009h. In\u00a0vivo studies using Galleria mellonella larvae infected with \nC.\u2009albicans\n demonstrated that ATV improved larval survival. Additionally, De Oliveira Neto et\u00a0al. [9] tested ATV in a VVC model with Wistar rats and reported that emulgels containing 3% ATV reduced the fungal load by 65% after 9\u2009days of treatment.\nTo date, the antifungal activity of ATV has been demonstrated predominantly in in\u00a0vitro studies. More recently, however, a pioneering clinical investigation assessed the impact of therapeutic statin use on oral Candida colonization in hyperlipidemic patients [123]. This study enrolled 50 patients receiving regular statin therapy (HLS group) and 50 hyperlipidemic patients not on statins (HLNS group), matched for sex, age, and dental status. The prevalence and colony counts of Candida were significantly lower in the HLS group compared with the HLNS group (20 patients, 40% vs. 30 patients, 60%, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.040). These findings suggest that statin therapy may be associated with a reduction in both the prevalence and burden of oral Candida colonization. Nevertheless, because this was an exploratory study involving patients already under statin treatment, dosing regimens were not standardized. At enrollment, 42 individuals (84%) were receiving 20\u2009mg daily, while smaller proportions were on 10 (6%), 40 (6%), 60 (2%), or 80\u2009mg (2%). This heterogeneity highlights the need for larger, well\u2010controlled trials to clarify the relationship between the antifungal effects of statins and variables such as dose, statin type, and duration of therapy, as well as to establish their clinical efficacy in managing oral Candida infections [123].\nComplementing this preliminary clinical evidence, in\u00a0vitro studies with clinical isolates further support the antifungal potential of statins. For instance, Golestannejad et\u00a0al. [124] compared the antifungal activity of fluconazole and ATV against Candida spp. isolated from patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, a condition frequently associated with refractory OC. Oral swabs from 33 patients were collected before and 2\u2009weeks after radiotherapy, and antifungal susceptibility was evaluated using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) assays. While ATV exhibited measurable antifungal effects, fluconazole demonstrated significantly greater potency at substantially lower concentrations against \nC.\u2009albicans\n, \nC.\u2009tropicalis\n, and \nC.\u2009glabrata\n, both before and after radiotherapy. These results reinforce the antifungal potential of ATV while emphasizing the need to explore synergistic combinations to enhance its efficacy, thereby supporting its continued evaluation in clinical settings.\nTo further enhance this antifungal potential, several strategies have been proposed to enhance the antifungal efficacy of statins while minimizing required dosages. One approach is pharmacological synergism with established antifungal agents, particularly azoles [116]. For instance, itraconazole and rosuvastatin combinations have produced marked synergy against 11 clinical isolates of \nC.\u2009albicans\n [125]. Likewise, fluconazole and ATV combinations have shown fungicidal activity within 24\u2009h against fluconazole\u2010resistant \nC.\u2009albicans\n, significantly inhibiting biofilm maturation and filamentation [126]. ATV has also demonstrated broad synergistic interactions with fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and ketoconazole against multidrug\u2010resistant \nC.\u2009albicans\n, suggesting superior potential relative to other statins [115]. While these studies did not consistently assess resistance profiles, the observed synergy raises the possibility that such combinations could be valuable even in certain drug\u2010resistant contexts, particularly when resistance mechanisms do not preclude the complementary actions of statins on fungal membrane integrity and signaling pathways [127].\nBeyond combination therapy, advanced drug delivery systems represent another promising strategy. Nanoparticle\u2010based carriers such as lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanocapsules, and liposomes can enhance ATV's solubility, stability, and targeted delivery to infect",
