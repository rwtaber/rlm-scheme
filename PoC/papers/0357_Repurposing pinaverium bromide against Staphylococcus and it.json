The biofilm and persister cells formation ability of MRSA and Staphylococcus epidermidis often companied with extremely high antimicrobial resistance. Pinaverium bromide (PVB) is an antispasmodic compound mainly used for irritable bowel syndrome. Here we demonstrate that PVB could rapidly kill MRSA and S. epidermidis planktonic cells and persister cells avoiding resistance occurrence. Moreover, by crystal violet staining, viable cells counting and SYTO9/PI staining, PVB exhibited strong biofilm inhibition and eradication activities on the 96-well plates, glass surface or titanium discs.

Mechanism study demonstrated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects by PVB were mainly mediated by proton motive force disrupting as well as reactive oxygen species inducing. Although, relatively poor pharmacokinetics were observed by systemic use, PVB could significantly reduce the viable bacterial cell loads and inflammatory infiltration in abscess in vivo caused by the biofilm forming strain ATCC 43,300. In all, our results indicated that PVB could be an alternative antimicrobial reagent for the treatment of MRSA, S. epidermidis and its biofilm related skin and soft tissue infections.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a common pathogen of hospital- and community-acquired infections, which can cause skin tissue infections, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, bacteremia, and other diseases (Lowy 1998). S. aureus was first discovered in 1880 by a Scottish surgeon on ulcer patients. Two years after the emergence of antibiotics, S. aureus developed resistance, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounting for 25\u201350% of hospital acquired S. aureus infections (Diekema et al. 2001). Up to now, S. aureus has become the dominant pathogen in hospital infections in multiple countries. According to data collected by the US National Healthcare Security Network from approximately 2,000 hospitals, the infection rate of MRSA ranges from 43 to 58% (Sievert et al. 2013). According to a survey by the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention, S. aureus has become the second most common hospital acquired pathogen after Escherichia coli (Abdulgader et al. 2015).\nAs major human and animal pathogens, S. aureus and S. epidermidis can attach to medical implants, such as titanium (Ti) surface, or host tissue, and further establish a biofilm to enhance its resistance to antibiotics and host (Buttner et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2024). The formation of biofilms can lead to serious infections in the human body. Biofilm is formed through the aggregation of bacterial species and brings many complications. It mediates drug resistance and persistence, and promotes the recurrence of infection (Nasser et al. 2022). In addition, both of S. aureus and S. epidermidis can form persister cells (Conlon 2014; Yang et al. 2015). Persister cells are populations of dormant cells highly tolerant to antibiotics and occurred at a high frequency under growth-limiting conditions or biofilms. The persister cells creation mechanisms mainly include metabolism alterations, response to changing environmental, and gene regulators changes. For example, the intracellular ATP reduction or deficiency in electron transport chain could lead to the formation of persister cells. Agr, RsaA, MgrA and SaeRS system could also enhance persister cells formation by biofilm regulation (Chang et al. 2020). Studies widely reported the role of persister cells in chronic and relapsing infectious diseases (Conlon 2014).\nThe proton motive force (PMF) is an electrochemical gradient on both sides of a bacterial cell membrane that drives many basic bacterial physiological processes, including biofilm formation, ATP synthesis, nutrient uptake, and waste excretion. Antimicrobial agents that interfere with PMF affect bacterial physiology through damage to proton pump function (Formicki et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2023). For example, dehydroacetic acid chloride exhibits its antimicrobial effects by destroying the function of bacterial proton pumps, making protons unable to efficiently transport on either side of bacterial cell membranes. This interference disrupts the internal and external electrochemical gradients of the bacteria, affecting their energy metabolism and nutrient uptake. Due to the impaired function of the proton pump, the bacteria cannot maintain the required PMF, which leads to the growth of the bacteria is blocked or even death (Formicki et al. 2019). Antimicrobial drugs targeting PMF can effectively disrupt energy metabolism and other key physiological processes of bacteria through the above mechanisms, providing a new avenue for antimicrobial therapy, especially in the context of the increasing prevalence of biofilms and drug-resistant strains. It also demonstrates the potential and importance of targeting PMF in antimicrobial and antibiofilm drug development (Ikonomidis et al. 2008).\nPinaverium bromide (PVB) is a L-type calcium channel antagonist with highly selective affinity in the gastrointestinal tract. It works by inhibiting calcium ions flowing into smooth muscle cells of splanchnic muscle and preventing form the muscle over-contracting (Alhadidi et al. 2020; Christen 1990). PVB is mainly used for the treatment of abdominal pain, biliary tract dysfunction and irritable bowel syndrome (Guslandi 1994; Wall et al. 2014). However, the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects, metabolic stability, in vivo antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity, and its underlying mechanisms by PVB against S. aureus and S. epidermidis were rarely reported.\nIn this study, the anti-planktonic cells and antibiofilm effects on polypropylene surface/glass/Ti-discs by PVB were detected, and the drug combinational activity between PVB and conventional antibiotics were determined by checkerboard dilution assay and time-killing assay. Meanwhile, the in vitro metabolic stability was assessed by plasma protein binding rate detection, liver microsome stability analysis, CYP450 catalytic activity assay as well as pharmacokinetic analysis. Mechanism study indicated that PVB exerted antimicrobial activity by PMF disruption and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction. In addition, the in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of PVB was assessed in an abscess infection model. Our findings provide the insight that PVB, alone or in combination with conventional antibiotics, may be an alternative for the treatment of the infectious diseases caused by Staphylococcus and its biofilms or persister cells.\n\n## Bacterial strains, culture conditions and reagents\nS. aureus strains of Newman, MRSA USA300, and ATCC 43,300, Acinetobacter baumannii AB1069 and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains of KPLUO and KPWANG were a kind gift from Li Min at Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. S. epidermidis RP62A and ATCC 12,228 were kindly provided by Qu Di at Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University. Escherichia coli Y9592 was donated by Chen Cha at Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. LZB1 was collected from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (She et al. 2020). Other type strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). S. aureus and S. epidermidis were cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB, Solarbio, Shanghai, China). Gram-negative bacteria and Candida strains were cultured in lysogeny broth (LB) broth (TSB, Solarbio, Shanghai, China) and RPMI 1640 medium (pH 7\u00b70\u2009\u00b1\u20090\u00b71), respectively. PVB and other antibiotics were purchased from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) and prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or distilled water as storage solutions.\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility test\nThe antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) (CLSI 2023), the antibacterial effects of the compounds were evaluated by the standard microdilution broth assay. At first, log-phase bacteria were diluted to a final concentration of approximately 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL with Mueller-Hinton (MH) II broth. These were then mixed with an equal volume of serial dilution compounds in a 96-well plate. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 16\u201318\u00a0h, the optical density (OD) value at \u00a0630 nm was determined. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited visible bacterial growth. Subsequently, the samples used for MIC determination were inoculated onto blood agar plates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was defined as the lowest concentration that eradicated 99% of bacteria in the initial inoculum.\n\n## Bactericidal kinetics\nOvernight cultures of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were diluted to 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL with TSB and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 180\u00a0rpm in the presence or absence of serial concentrations of PVB. The colony forming unit (CFU) counts of the cultures were determined at time points of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24\u00a0h, respectively. Briefly, an aliquot of the bacterial suspension in each group was serially diluted with saline, and spotted onto sheep blood agar. After incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the colonies on the agars were counted (Li et al. 2017).\n\n## Bacterial resistance inducing assay\nFirstly, the MICs of PVB and ciprofloxacin (CIP, positive control) against S. aureus and S. epidermidis were determined on the first day. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 16\u201318\u00a0h, 50 \u00b5L of the bacterial suspension at the 1/2\u00d7 MIC were 1,000-fold diluted with fresh MH broth. Then, 50 \u00b5L of the diluted suspension and equal volume of serially diluted PVB were added to a 96-well plate. The MICs were determined after 24\u00a0h of incubation. This process was repeated continuously for 15 days (Martin et al. 2020).\n\n## Antibiofilm effects of PVB in 96-well cell culture plate\nTSBg (TSB with 0.2% glucose) culture medium was used for the biofilm related assays. For biofilm inhibition assay, 100 \u00b5L of serially diluted PVB with equal volume of 1: 200 diluted overnight cultured S. aureus ATCC 43,300 were added into a 96-well cell culture plate. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the plate was washed by 1\u00d7PBS, and the biofilms were quantified by crystal violet staining and CFU counting, respectively. Briefly, for crystal violet staining, the plate was added with 200 \u00b5L of 0.25% (w/v) crystal violet. After incubation for 15\u00a0min, the excess dye was removed and washed by 1\u00d7PBS. Then, the adhered dye was dissolved in 95% ethanol for 30\u00a0min, and the absorbance at 570\u00a0nm was measured. For CFU counting assay, the biofilms were resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7PBS, sonicated for 15\u00a0min and serially diluted with 1\u00d7PBS. The diluted bacterial suspension was then spotted on sheep blood agar plates, and the CFUs were counted after overnight cultured at 37 \u00b0C.\nFor biofilm eradication assay, overnight cultured S. aureus was 1: 200 diluted with TSBg, and 200 \u00b5L of the bacterial suspension was added into each well in a 96-well cell culture plate. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the wells were rinsed twice with 1\u00d7PBS, and added with indicated concentrations of PVB. After incubation for further 24\u00a0h, the biofilm was washed again and quantified by crystal violet staining and CFU counting, respectively, as described above (Kazmierczak et al. 2022; Xu et al. 2021).\n\n## Biofilm observation by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LCSM)\nFor biofilm formation inhibition, the bacteria overnight cultured were 1: 200 diluted with TSBg medium, then 2 mL of the bacterial suspension in the presence or absence of PVB was transferred into a 6-well cell culture plate with a glass cover slide in each well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the cover slides were gently washed twice with saline and stained with 10 \u00b5M SYTO9/PI for 15\u00a0min in the dark. Then, the excess dye was removed by 1\u00d7PBS washing, and the biofilms were observed with a LCSM (Zeiss LSM800, Jena, Germany). The excitation and emission wavelengths for SYTO9 and PI were 485\u00a0nm/530 nm and 485/630 nm, respectively.\nFor biofilm eradication, the biofilms were formed on the cover slide with TSBg medium for 24\u00a0h, then, washed and treated with indicated concentrations of PVB. After further incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the cover slides were washed, stained with SYTO9/PI and observed by the LCSM as described above (Liu et al. 2015).\n\n## Biofilm inhibition on Ti-discs\nOvernight cultures of S. aureus or S. epidermidis were diluted 1: 200 in fresh TSBg with or without PVB at concentrations ranging from 4 to 64\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. DMSO was used as a control. Then, 2 mL of the bacterial suspension was added in a 6-well cell culture plate in the presence of a Ti-disc in each well. Following static incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the Ti-discs were washed by transferring to a new plate containing sterile saline. For viable cells counting, the biofilms on the discs were dispersed in 2 mL of saline by sonication for 15\u00a0min, then serially diluted and spotted on sheep blood agar. After overnight incubation, the colonies on the agar were counted. For crystal violet staining, the discs were stained with 0.25% (w/v) crystal violet for 15\u00a0min. The discs were washed again and solubilized with 95% ethanol for 30\u00a0min, and the total biofilm biomass was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 570\u00a0nm (A570).\n\n## Biofilm eradication on Ti-discs\nThe 24-hour biofilms on the Ti-discs were formed in TSBg as described above. After washed with saline, the discs were treated with 2 mL of TSBg in the presence or absence of PVB ranging from 4 to 64\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. After further incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the remaining biofilm was washed and quantified either by CFU counting or crystal violet staining as described above (Gomes et al. 2009; Jiang et al. 2018).\n\n## Persister cells killing assay\nThe S. aureus and S. epidermidis persister cells were obtained by incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 180\u00a0rpm for 24\u00a0h to the stationary phase in TSB. The persister cells were washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS (pH\u2009=\u20097.4) and then adjusted to approximately OD630nm\u2009=\u20090.2. Then, the persister cells were treated with 64\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of vancomycin (VAN) or indicated concentrations of PVB, respectively. The CFU counts were performed at the time point of 0, 2, and 4\u00a0h, respectively. DMSO (1%, vol/vol) was utilized as a control (Kim et al. 2018).\n\n## Checkerboard dilution assay\nThe effects of PVB in combination with conventional antibiotics were assessed by checkerboard dilution assay. Briefly, log-phased S. aureus ATCC 43300 was diluted with MH broth to 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL. Equal volumes of serially diluted PVB and antibiotics in the presence of the bacterial suspensions were added into the rows and columns of an \u201c8\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u201d checkerboard in a 96-well plate. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 16\u201318\u00a0h, the MICs were determined and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values were calculated as follows:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{FICI}} = \\frac{{{\\text{MIC}}_{{{\\text{A(combination)}}}} }}{{{\\text{MIC}}_{{{\\text{A(alone)}}}} }} + \\frac{{{\\text{MIC}}_{{{\\text{B(combination)}}}} }}{{{\\text{MIC}}_{{{\\text{B(alone)}}}} }} $$\\end{document}\nSynergistic effect was defined as FICI\u2009\u2264\u20090.5; additive effect was defined as 0.5\u2009<\u2009FICI\u2009\u2264\u20091; indifference effect was defined as 1\u2009<\u2009FICI\u2009\u2264\u20094; antagonism effect was defined as FICI\u2009>\u20094 (Dupieux et al., 2017).\n\n## Ultrastructure observation by electronic microscopy\nS. aureus ATCC 43,300 overnight cultures were sub-cultured with TSB to log phase. The bacterial suspension was then washed twice with 1\u00d7PBS (pH\u2009=\u20097.4) and adjusted to 0.5 McF with TSB medium containing 5\u00d7MIC of PVB or 0.1% DMSO (control). After incubation at 37\u00b0C and 180\u00a0rpm for 1\u00a0h, the bacterial suspensions were further washed with 1\u00d7PBS and centrifuged at 4,000 \u00d7 g for 8\u00a0min. The cell pellets were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Solarbio, Shanghai, China) and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight. For scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), after removing the fixative with 1\u00d7PBS, the bacteria pellets were dehydrated using a series of ethanol concentrations (25, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100%). Then, the dried samples were covered with gold palladium and observed by a SEM (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). For transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) observation, the bacteria were dehydrated and infiltrated in epoxy resin. Two days later, the materials were cut into the ultrathin sections and counterstained with lead citrate solution. Finally, the samples were observed by a TEM (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) (Pengfei et al. 2022).\n\n## Erythrocytes hemolysis assay\nHuman erythrocytes (Hemo Pharmaceutical & Biological Co. Shanghai, China) were washed three times with 1\u00d7PBS (pH\u2009=\u20097.4) and resuspended to the concentration of 10% (v/v). Then, the cells were exposed to equal volumes of PVB at the indicated concentrations and incubated statically at 37 \u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. The negative and positive controls were prepared by using 0.1% DMSO and 0.1% Triton X-100, respectively. After incubation, 100 \u00b5L of supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate and the absorbance was measured at 570\u00a0nm. The rate of hemolysis was calculated using the following formula (Tan et al. 2020):\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{Hemolysis\\,(\\%)}}= \\frac{{{\\text{A}}_{{{\\text{sample}}}}  - {\\text{A}}_{{{\\text{0.1\\% \\,DMSO}}}} }}{{{\\text{A}}_{{{\\text{0.1\\% \\,Triton\\,X-100}}}}  - {\\text{A}}_{{{\\text{0.1\\% \\,DMSO}}}} }} \\times 100\\%.$$\\end{document}\n\n## Antimicrobial effects of PVB in the presence of L-Glutathione (GSH) or anaerobic condition\nTo explore the role of ROS on the antimicrobial ability by PVB, the MIC of PVB against MRSA ATCC 43,300 was determined as described above in the presence of 10 mM reduced GSH (a ROS scavenger). Further, the MIC was also detected in the anaerobic condition by using AnaeroGen anaerobic system envelopes (Thermo Scientific, USA).\n\n## Cytotoxicity determination by CCK-8 kit\nThe cells of LO2 and HepG2 were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2. One hundred microliters of logarithmic phased cells were seeded into a 96-well cell culture plate at a density of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells per well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24\u00a0h, a indicated concentrations of PVB was added to each well. The cells treated with 0.1% DMSO were set as a control. After incubation for 24\u00a0h, 10 \u00b5L of CCK-8 solution were added to each well, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h. The cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 450\u00a0nm (A450) (Liu et al. 2015).\n\n## Apoptosis determination by flow cytometer\nApoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with Annexin APC/PI kit. Briefly, the cells were prepared as described above, and then digested with trypsin. After centrifuged and washed twice with 1\u00d7PBS, the cells were resuspended in 1\u00d7PBS with Annexin APC/PI. After incubation in the dark for 10\u00a0min, the cells were analyzed by a flow cytometry (BD, USA) (Liu et al. 2015).\n\n## Transmembrane potential detection by DiSC3(5) probe\nThe mid-log phase S. aureus strains were adjusted to an OD630nm of 0.2 in HEPES buffer in the presence of 5 mM glucose and 100 mM KCl. DiSC3(5) (MedChem Express, New Jersey, USA) was added to the bacterial suspension to a final concentration of 2 \u00b5M. Following the gently mixing of the DiSC3(5)-labelled bacteria with indicated concentrations of PVB, the fluorescence intensity was measured at the excitation/emission wavelengths of 622\u00a0nm/670 nm, respectively, after incubation for 30\u00a0s. Melittin (2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (Liu et al. 2022).\n\n## Transmembrane proton concentration detection by BCECF-AM probe\nThe S. aureus strains were grown in TSB to a mid-log phase. Then the bacteria were washed and resuspended in 5 mL of HEPES buffer in the presence of 10 \u00b5M of BCECF-AM (MedChem Express, New Jersey, USA). After incubation in the dark for 30\u00a0min, the bacteria were treated with indicated concentrations of PVB. Melittin (2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The fluorescence intensities were monitored at an interval of 5\u00a0min with the excitation/emission wavelength of 500\u00a0nm/522 nm, respectively (Liu et al. 2020).\n\n## Intracellular ROS quantification by 2\u2019,7\u2019-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) probe\nThe mid-log phased S. aureus strains were adjusted to OD630nm\u2009=\u20090.5 with 1\u00d7PBS. And the bacterial suspension was incubated with 10 \u00b5M of DCFH-DA (MedChem Express, New Jersey, USA) for 30\u00a0min in the dark. Then, 90 \u00b5L of the labeled bacterial suspension with 10 \u00b5L of indicated concentrations of PVB were added to a black 96-well plate. After incubation for 30\u00a0min, the fluorescence was observed by the LCSM, and the intensities were quantified by measured at the excitation/emission wavelength of 488 and 525\u00a0nm, respectively (Song et al. 2020).\n\n## ROS components determination\nIntracellular ROS is mainly comprised of specific reactive species, including superoxide (O2\u2022\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH). These can be evaluated by using the fluorescence probes of HKSOX-1, HKperox-2, and HKOH-1r (MedChem Express, New Jersey, USA), respectively. Briefly, the log-phased bacterial suspension was adjusted to OD630nm\u2009=\u20090.5 in the presence of 10 \u00b5M specific probes in 1\u00d7PBS. After incubation for 30\u00a0min in the dark, the bacteria suspension was mixed with indicated concentrations of PVB and further incubated for 30\u00a0min. Melittin (2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The fluorescence intensities were monitored at the excitation/emission wavelength of 500/520 nm, 520/543 nm, and 500/520 nm for HKSOX-1, HKperox-2, and HKOH-1r, respectively (She et al. 2023).\nThe in vivo mice models and other methods were shown in the Supplementary Information.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nAll quantitative measurments were performed in triplicate. The data were processed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (Software Inc., CA, USA). Student\u2019s t-test was applied for comparison between two independent groups, and one-way ANOVA was used for comparison between multiple groups. Statistical significance was considered with P\u2009<\u20090.05.\n\n## Bactericidal activity of PVB against \nBy micro-dilution assay, PVB was found to be effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis with the MIC and MBC values of 8\u201316\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and 16\u201364\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively. However, extremely low or none antimicrobial activity was observed by PVB against Gram-negative pathogens or fungi (Table\u00a01). Meanwhile, PVB showed time- and concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. As shown in Fig.\u00a01A/2\u00d7MIC of PVB could effectively inhibit the bacterial growth, and 1\u20132\u00d7MIC of PVB significantly reduce the viable cell counts to the limit of detection. Noticeably, a rebound of the CFU count was found by USA300 after 8\u00a0h of treatment with 1\u20132\u00d7MIC of PVB, the widely reported phenomenon could be probably due to the depletion of the antimicrobial agent, the limitation of detection limit, or/and the resistance occurrence (Li et al. 2023). In addition, by consecutive inducing in the presence of sub-MIC of PVB for a total of 15 passages, almost none or extremely low resistance was occurred by S. aureus or S. epidermidis (Fig.\u00a01B).Table 1Antimicrobial susceptibility of PVB against pathogensStrainsResistance patternPVBMIC (\u00b5g/mL)MBC (\u00b5g/mL)S. aureus\u00a0ATCC 29,213MSSA864\u00a0ATCC 25,923MSSA816\u00a0NewmanMSSA816\u00a0ATCC 43,300MRSA1616\u00a0USA300MRSA864\u00a0LZB1MSSA, BFP832S. epidermidis\u00a0RP62AMSSE, BFP816\u00a0ATCC 12,228MSSE, BFN816E. coli\u00a0ATCC 25,922Non-MDR128256\u00a0Y9592XDR128128K. pneumoniae\u00a0ATCC 700,603Non-MDR>\u2009256>\u2009256\u00a0ATCC 4352Non-MDR3264\u00a0KPLUOXDR256256\u00a0KPWANGXDR256256A. baumannii\u00a0ATCC 19,606Non-MDR256256\u00a0AB1069XDR>\u2009256>\u2009256P. aeruginosa\u00a0PAO1Non-MDR, BFP256>\u2009256C. albicans\u00a0ATCC 14,053Non-MDR128>\u2009256C. parapsilosis\u00a0ATCC 22,019Non-MDR128>\u2009256BFP: biofilm formation positive; BFN: biofilm formation negativeFig. 1Effective bactericidal activity of PVB against Staphylococcus avoiding resistance occurrence.

CIP was used as a positive control\nNext the synergistical antimicrobial effects were screened between PVB and conventional antibiotics by checkerboard dilution assay. As shown in Fig.\u00a02A and I; Table\u00a02, AMP, CEF, and OXA were exhibited synergy when combined with PVB with the FICI values of 0.5, 0.313, and 0.25, respectively (Fig.\u00a02J). The time-killing assay further exhibited the synergistical bactericidal activity between 1/4\u00d7MIC of PVB and 1/4\u00d7MIC of AMP/CEF/OXA (Fig.\u00a02K).Table 2Combinational antimicrobial effects between PVB and conventional antibioticsGroupsDrugsMICaloneMICcombinedFold changeFICIOutcome1PVB81623indifferenceTET2212PVB8812indifferenceDOX0.250.2513PVB8812indifferenceE>\u2009256>\u200925614PVB161612indifferenceAZI>\u2009256>\u200925615PVB8812indifferenceLEV0.1250.12516PVB1680.51additiveDAP0.250.1250.57PVB161612indifferenceFOS323218PVB8812indifferenceLZD2219PVB8812indifferenceVAN11110PVB1680.51.5indifferenceP>\u2009256>\u2009256111PVB1680.50.75additiveCAZ3280.2512PVB1640.250.5synergyAMP1640.2513PVB80.50.06250.5625additiveCEZ1680.514PVB1610.06250.3125synergyCEF20.50.2515PVB810.1250.25synergyOXA1620.12516PVB1680.50.5625additiveCRO3220.062517PVB881>\u20092indifference/antagonismAMK64>\u200964>\u2009118PVB8812indifferenceGEN1616119PVB1680.54.5antagonismKANA2561024420PVB8815antagonismTOB64256421PVB161612indifferenceSPC1281281A synergistic effect was defined as FICI\u2009\u2264\u20090.5; an additive effect was defined as 0.5\u2009<\u2009FICI\u2009\u2264\u20091; an indifference effect was defined as 1\u2009<\u2009FICI\u2009\u2264\u20094; an antagonism effect was defined as FICI\u2009>\u2009\u00a04Fig. 2Combinational antimicrobial effects between PVB and conventional antibiotics against MRSA ATCC 43,300.

And the effective biofilm inhibitory effects by 1\u00d7MIC of PVB against the Staphylococcus on glass cover slides were also observed by LCSM with the reduced biofilm biomass and increased proportion of PI-stained (impaired or dead) cells (Fig.\u00a03C). Although, as reported widely, the pre-formed biofilm exhibited higher antibiotic resistance than its related planktonic cells (Mah 2012), PVB also showed effective antimicrobial activity against the pre-formed biofilms (include the total biofilm biomass and viable bacterial cells in the biofilms) of the MRSA and S. epidermidis. As we expected, the pre-formed biofilm eradication activity by PVB was, to some extent, slightly inferior than that of the biofilm inhibition (Fig.\u00a03D and E). And the LCSM also exhibited the effective biofilm eradication effects by 16\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of PVB against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively (Fig.\u00a03F). In addition, PVB was also found to inhibit the biofilm formation or eradicate the pre-formed biofilms against USA300 and RP62A on Ti-discs. As shown in Fig.\u00a04A\u00a0C, 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of PVB started to inhibit the biofilm formation of USA300 on Ti-discs by crystal violet staining, and 32\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of PVB could significantly reduce the viable cell counts in the biofilms. While, 8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of PVB showed effective biofilm eradication activity against the pre-formed biofilms, and 64\u00a0\u00b5g/mL PVB could largely decrease the total viable cells in the biofilms (Fig.\u00a04B and C). Similarly, PVB also exhibited effective biofilm inhibitory (Fig.\u00a04D and F) and eradicating (Fig.\u00a04E and F) effects against S. epidermidis RP62A on Ti-discs.Fig. 3Antibiofilm activity by PVB.

(F) Representative images of inhibition and eradication effects of PVB against RP62A biofilms on Ti-discs determined by crystal violet staining\nIn addition, PVB also exhibited bactericidal activity against MRSA and S. epidermidis persister cells. The persister cells were formed by overnight culture in TSB at 37\u00b0C to stationary phase. As shown in Figure S1, all the persister cells were resistant to high concentration (64\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) of VAN. However, 1\u20134\u00d7MIC of PVB could effectively kill the persister cells in a concentration-dependent manner within 4\u00a0h.\n\n## Model of action\nThe microstructure of PVB-treated S. aureus cells was observed by TME and SEM, respectively. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A and B, the periplasmic space was significantly increased, and some of the bacterial cells were shrunk or broken after treated with PVB. Thus, we supposed that there could be osmotic pressure imbalance between the inner and outer membranes which could be probably due to the disruption of PMF. And the PMF was also an important factor for the ATP synthesis, and the ATP is ",
