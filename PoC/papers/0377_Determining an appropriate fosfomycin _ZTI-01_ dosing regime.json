  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nHospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections, accounting for 22% of all reported cases (1). It is primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, all of which belong to the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species), recognized by the WHO as a priority concern due to their role in life-threatening and antimicrobial resistance infections (2, 3). Globally, HAP represents the leading cause of hospital infections in intensive care units (ICUs), with estimated mortality rates of 20%\u201330% (3).\nFor many decades, the standard treatment for pneumonia was beta-lactams, a class of antibiotics that has been ineffective in fighting against resistant bacteria. To address this issue, various strategies have been developed, including developing newer generations, such as cephalosporins and carbapenems, or combining beta-lactams with beta-lactamase inhibitors (3). Unfortunately, the pathogens that can cause HAP often produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or have developed resistance mechanisms against carbapenems (4\u20136). With limited treatment options available for HAP, there has been a suggestion to re-evaluate and use some of the \u201cforgotten\u201d older antibiotics (7, 8).\nOne such candidate is fosfomycin, an old antibiotic first identified in 1969 and approved in 1996 for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. Fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that inhibits MurA (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase), an enzyme catalyzing the first step of bacterial cell wall synthesis, thereby disrupting cell wall formation (9). It has been reported that fosfomycin is effective in treating various infections caused by resistant pathogens (8, 10, 11). When administered via IV infusion, fosfomycin rapidly penetrates into the human tissues, achieving therapeutically relevant concentrations in serum, urine, and various organs, including the lungs (12). Clinical data showed that fosfomycin is well-tolerated, undergoes renal excretion with an elimination half-life of 1.9 to 3.9 h, has negligible protein binding, and has a volume of distribution (Vd) of 9 to 30 L after IV administration (13). Its antimicrobial efficacy is concentration-dependent, meaning that higher drug concentrations lead to greater microbial killing, and its effectiveness is often associated with the area under the curve [AUC]/MIC ratios (14).\nBased on its favorable efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics profiles, fosfomycin represents a potential promising candidate in combating resistant pneumonia. To facilitate the transition of fosfomycin to broader indications, including pneumonia, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) initiated a Phase 1 clinical study on the safety and intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics (PK) of fosfomycin in healthy volunteers, in which samples were collected from not only plasma but also from two main sites of infection, namely pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and alveolar macrophages (AMs); results from the original study have been recently published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (15)\nThe precious intrapulmonary PK data of fosfomycin provide an opportunity to quantitatively evaluate the relationship among different dosing regimens, drug exposure at the infection site, and the probability of target attainment (PTA) using a modeling approach. Antimicrobial resistance is associated with suboptimal dosing regimens that result in insufficient exposure at the infection sites. Since attaining drug concentrations above the MIC is crucial for bacterial eradication and preventing resistance, tailoring dosing regimens based on the concentrations at the infection site may lower the risk of developing antimicrobial resistance (16). In this study, we utilized fosfomycin PK data from plasma, ELF, and AMs to develop a minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetics (m-PBPK) model. This model enables us to evaluate the effects of pathophysiological changes that occur during pneumonia on drug concentrations at the infection site. Furthermore, we linked fosfomycin PK data to its antimicrobial efficacy (PD effect) by conducting a PTA analysis to evaluate the likelihood of achieving the desired PD effect across a wide range of MIC values following the administration of different dosing regimens (17). The PTA analysis helped us propose a dosing recommendation for pneumonia populations that can be utilized in subsequent clinical studies and future clinical practice.\n\n## Data source\nThe data were obtained from the NIAID Phase 1 clinical study (NCT03910673) conducted at the Duke University Early Phase Clinical Research Unit (DEPRU) after being approved by the university\u2019s institutional review board. The study investigated the safety and intrapulmonary PK of fosfomycin administered by intravenous injection (ZTI-01) in healthy participants. After obtaining written informed consent, 37 participants aged 18\u201345 years with normal renal function were enrolled to receive three doses of 6 g intravenous fosfomycin infused over 1 h every 8 h (q8h). Blood samples were collected before the administration of all doses and at 0.5, 1, 1.25, 2, and 5 h after the administration of the first and third doses, with two more sampling points collected at 8 and 12 h after the third dose. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 15 min, and plasma samples were then collected and stored at \u221270\u00b0C or below. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at randomly assigned time points (0.5, 1.25, 2, 5, and 8 h) after the third dose from 30 participants. Each participant contributed to one BAL sampling time point, with six participants per time point. A detailed schematic diagram of the study is presented in Fig. 1. Concentrations of fosfomycin in ELF and AM cells from BAL samples, as well as in plasma samples, were analyzed using validated assay of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\n\n## Model development\nUsing data from these participants, population PK model (compartmental and m-PBPK) for plasma, ELF, and AMs were developed for fosfomycin using the nonlinear mixed effect model program NONMEM (Version 7.4.3; Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Maryland) interfaced with Pirana (Version 2.9.9). The first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI) and a user-defined subroutine (ADVAN6 or ADVAN8) were used to estimate the PK parameters, interindividual variability (IIV), and residual variability (RV). All the data, including plasma, ELF, and AMs were analyzed simultaneously, and the IIV was estimated using an exponential model, while the RV was modeled with a proportional error model. Data processing and graphical analysis were performed using RStudio 4.2.2 (RStudio4, PBC, Boston, Massachusetts) and GraphPad Prism (Version 10.0.2; La Jolla, California, United States).\n\n## Compartmental model\nThe compartmental model was initially developed to characterize fosfomycin intrapulmonary PK. The detailed development history of the compartmental model is presented in Table S1 in the supplementary material. The final compartmental model structure, shown in Fig. S1 in the supplementary material, consists of four compartments: central, peripheral, ELF, and AMs. The final estimated parameters are presented in Table S2 in the supplementary material. Moreover, the goodness-of-fit plots in Fig. S2 demonstrate that the model accurately captures drug concentrations in plasma, ELF, and AMs with minimal bias. Given the limitations of compartmental models in representing the complexities of physiological processes and anatomical structures, we transitioned to a m-PBPK model.\n\n## Base model\nThe proposed m-PBPK model consists of three main compartments: plasma, lung, and residual tissues, where all other organs are lumped into a single compartment. The lung compartment is further subdivided into four distinct compartments: lung tissues, interstitial fluid (ISF), ELF, and AMs. The ELF is a thin aqueous layer that covers the alveolar surfaces, while the AMs are the main immune cells found within the ELF space, accounting for nearly 80% of all immune cells in this fluid (18). This model, as shown in Fig. 2, is established based on the anatomical structure of the lung. When fosfomycin enters the lung, it first distributes into the ISF. From there, it is further distributed to the lung tissues and the ELF. Once in the ELF, fosfomycin can enter the AMs through an uptake mechanism. Like all the m-PBPK models, the proposed model has some physiological constraints: fd (fraction of the cardiac output) \u22641, and the total volume of all compartments equals the body weight. Additionally, the parameter fd \u00d7 QC represents distribution clearance (19). Physiological parameters, such as cardiac output (Qc), lung volume (VLung), plasma (Vp), ISF (VISF), ELF (VELF), and AMs (VAMs) were fixed to their reported physiological values (18\u201323). The fixed parameters are listed in Table 1.\n\n## Base model limitation and further modifications performed\nInitially, we did not include a partition coefficient for the ELF (KpELF) in our model because fosfomycin has negligible protein binding (13), and the protein level in the ELF space is much lower compared with the plasma (18). Therefore, we assumed that drug distribution in the ELF occurred without significant binding. While the base model accurately captured fosfomycin PK in plasma, it did not adequately capture drug concentration in the ELF and AMs. To address this, we conducted further literature research and revised our model based on our improved understanding of the ELF composition. We learned that surfactants are the primary components of the ELF, with phosphatidylcholine accounting for approximately 80% of the total surfactant content (its structure is shown in Fig. S3 in the supplementary material) (24). The polar head of this surfactant contains a negatively charged phosphate group and a positively charged quaternary amine. Since fosfomycin will be negatively charged in the pulmonary region, where the pH is approximately 7.4 in the ISF and 6.6 in the ELF (23), and considering its pKa value of 1.25 (25), we added the partition coefficient in the ELF (kpELF) to account for the binding interaction between fosfomycin and surfactant.\nThe addition of the KpELF parameter significantly enhanced the model\u2019s ability to predict drug concentration in the ELF. Accordingly, KpELF was incorporated in the final model.\n\n## Final model\nThe equations that describe the rate of fosfomycin transfer between the compartments in our final m-PBPK model are listed below:\nIn the equation above, the variables are presented in the general format of Acompartment, where A represents the amount, and Kpcompartment, where Kp represents the partition coefficient. The Kp is defined as the ratio of drug concentrations between a tissue (or compartment) and plasma. PS refers to the permeability-surface product, either between the ISF and lung tissue (PS1) or between the ISF and ELF (PS2). Cardiac output is represented by (Qc), while K1 and K2 are the uptake and efflux rate constants, respectively. The names and definitions for all PK parameters are provided in Table 2.\n\n## Model evaluation\nThe final selection of the model was determined based on its biological and physiological relevance, quality of goodness-of-fit plots, stability of parameter estimates, and objective function value (OFV). For comparing the models, the likelihood ratio test was employed, requiring a decrease of 3.84 points in the NONMEM objective function (OFV= \u22122 log likelihood) to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in model performance (statistically significant at \u03b1 = 0.05).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\nThe model was initially developed based on healthy participants. However, during the infection, various pathophysiological changes may occur which could potentially affect the model parameters. These pathophysiological changes include (i) the permeability of the lung membrane is often increased (26), which can result in an increase in PS1 and PS2, (ii) the number of alveolar macrophages will decrease, as the neutrophil will be the predominant innate immune cell leading to a reduction in VAms (27), (iii) alveolar edema causes an increase in fluid in the alveolar space, resulting in an increase in VELF (3), and (iv) surfactant inactivation may also reduce the KpELF value (28). Collectively, these changes may lead to significant alterations in drug concentrations at the infection site. To investigate how variations in these parameters affect drug concentrations in the ELF, we conducted a sensitivity analysis.\nIn the sensitivity analysis, we fixed all final PK parameters from the final model and physiological values obtained from healthy participants, then we modified one parameter at a time\u2014PS1, PS2, VAMs, VELF, and KpELF\u2014to evaluate the effect of each individual change on the intrapulmonary PK of fosfomycin. The adjusted values for each parameter are provided in Table 3. We conducted the sensitivity analysis to predict the PK of fosfomycin at the infection site in pneumonia patients. This step is essential for our next PTA analysis as it enabled us to propose a dosing regimen for the patient population, considering various pathophysiological conditions and their impact on drug concentration at the infection site, specifically in the ELF. We investigated the effect of changing the following parameters on the drug concentration in the ELF space:\n\n## Increasing membrane permeability (increasing the PS\nIncreasing alveolar membrane permeability is due to the elastase that is produced by neutrophils, which causes proteolysis of pulmonary tissue. Plasma elastase levels correlate significantly with the pulmonary vascular permeability index, which increases 2.5-fold in pneumonia patients (26). Consequently, we assumed a 150% increase in the permeability surface area product (PS) parameter.\n\n## Increasing the ELF volume (increasing V\nNo specific data are available on the extent of ELF volume increase in bacterial pneumonia. However, mild intra-alveolar edema is known to develop in the early stages of infection (3). In the absence of quantitative data, we assumed a 50% increase in ELF during infection. This assumption has been applied in previous studies to quantify pathophysiological changes and their impact on the PK profile of antibiotics at the infection site (23).\n\n## Changing the cell population (decreasing V\nIn a healthy population, the percentage of AMs in the BAL samples is over 80% (18, 29). However, this percentage decreases to approximately 20% in patients with pneumonia (27). Therefore, we assumed a 75% reduction in the VAMs value during infection. The adjusted value was set to 0.00065 L compared with the initial value of 0.0026 L.\n\n## Inactivation of the surfactant (decreasing Kp\nDuring infection, surfactant homeostasis is disrupted (2). Increased membrane permeability leads to higher albumin concentrations in the pulmonary region, which can deactivate the available surfactant (28). Specific quantitative data on surfactant levels in adult pneumonia patients are lacking. Therefore, we used plasma albumin levels as a surrogate marker, as many studies have reported that hypoalbuminemia is highly associated with pneumonia severity (30). Albumin levels can drop rapidly during acute infections due to increased membrane permeability, which results in the leakage of albumin from the bloodstream into the surrounding tissues (31). In a healthy population, normal albumin levels range from 3.5 to 4.5 g/dL (32), and the KpELF was estimated to be 0.393. In pneumonia patients, mild hypoalbuminemia can occur, leading to a 26% decrease in albumin levels, which lowers them to a range of 2.5 to 3.5 g/dL (32). We applied this same percentage decline to KpELF, resulting in a new value of 0.29.\n\n## Probability of target attainment (PTA) analysis\nBased on the final PK parameters presented in Table 2, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation in NONMEM (Version 7.4.3) to evaluate the PTA of fosfomycin in plasma and ELF following the administration of several dosing regimens, including 4, 5, 6, or 8g q8h, and 8 or 10 g q12h, each infused over 1 h. All the evaluated dosing regimens are within the approved daily doses (33, 34). For the pneumonia population, we adjusted the PK parameters from the final model to account for the impact of pathophysiological changes that occur during pneumonia based on the findings from our sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we set KpELF to 0.29 and VELF to 0.039 L, as the analysis indicated that these adjustments would lower drug concentrations in the ELF, while plasma concentrations would remain unchanged. Subsequently, we evaluated the PTA% of fosfomycin in this population after the administration of the same dosing regimens.\nFor each scenario (healthy and pneumonia populations), we simulated 1,000 virtual subjects and generated concentration\u2013time profiles in both plasma and ELF at steady state. AUC24 was calculated to predict the PTA% using PK/PD targets of AUC24/MIC 28.2 for P. aeruginosa and \u226542.8 for S. aureus (35, 36). The MIC values covered in our analysis ranged from 0.5 to 512 mg/L, consistent with previously reported values for fosfomycin against these two pathogens (37). Although A. baumannii can also cause HAP, no PK/PD target has been established for this organism; therefore, it was not included in our PTA analysis. Target attainment was considered successful if the PTA% was \u226590%. Additionally, for each pathogen and dosing regimen, we calculated the breakpoint, which is the highest MIC for which the PTA% reached at least 90%.\n\n## Estimated parameters\nThe final estimated parameters are presented in Table 2. The systematic clearance was estimated to be 6.59 L/h, consistent with the reported values (13). Furthermore, the permeability surface area product between the ISF and ELF (PS2) was estimated at 0.0316 L/h, which aligns with our expectations, as the alveolar membrane composed of tight junctions requires the drug in the ISF to penetrate the membrane to reach the ELF (18). The estimated partition coefficient in the lung tissues (KpLung tissue) is high, suggesting that the concentration of fosfomycin in homogenized lung tissue would be significantly higher than that in plasma. All estimated values show low relative standard error (RSE) values (less than 55%), and there is a small degree of shrinkage in the inter-variability (IVV), indicating the model\u2019s reliability.\n\n## Goodness of model fitting\nFigure 3 represents the time course of observed versus predicted concentrations in the plasma, ELF, and AMs. As shown in the figure, almost all the predicted concentrations fell within the standard deviation of the observed values. Additional diagnostic goodness-of-fit plots are shown in Fig. 4. As illustrated, the data are distributed around the line of identity or the zero-line, indicating that the model accurately captures the fosfomycin PK profile with minimal bias.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\nELF and AMs are the main sites of infection for extracellular and intracellular pathogens, respectively (18). Intracellular pathogens can survive within host cells, including the AMs, requiring antibiotics to penetrate these cells for effective bacterial eradication. In contrast, extracellular pathogens cannot survive inside cells and are eliminated after being engulfed by the immune cells. Since both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are classified as extracellular pathogens (38), we evaluated the effect of pathophysiological changes on drug concentration in the ELF, the main site for extracellular infection. The results showed that not all changes influence drug concentration in the ELF. Table 3 summarizes the modified model parameter values and their effects on the overall ELF PK profile. Moreover, Fig. 5 illustrates the pathophysiological changes associated with each parameter and their effect on the overall ELF PK profile. Increasing membrane permeability, which increases PS1 and PS2, and a decrease in the amount of AM in the alveolar space, which leads to a reduction in VAM, have no significant impact on the overall PK profile in the ELF, as shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. On the other hand, alveolar edema, which increases alveolar fluid and may raise VELF by 50%, was predicted to affect fosfomycin PK in ELF, albeit in a minor degree (Fig. 5c). In contrast, inactivating the surfactant, which results in a decrease in KpELF by 26%, has the greatest impact on lowering drug concentrations in the ELF space, as illustrated in Fig. 5d. Consequently, we adjusted the values of VELF and KpELF value in our PTA analysis to account for these two significant pathophysiological changes in pneumonia patients. None of these changes impact the drug concentration in plasma, as plasma concentration is primarily determined by other PK parameters, as previously described in Equation 1.\n\n## Probability of target attainment (PTA) analysis\nBased on the PK parameters estimated from the final model, a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the PTA of fosfomycin in plasma and ELF for healthy participants. For the pneumonia population, KpELF and VELF values were adjusted to 0.29 and 0.039 L, respectively, to reflect the pathophysiological changes that happened during the infection, and another Monte Carlo simulation was performed to evaluate the PTA of fosfomycin in plasma and ELF for this population. We evaluated the PTA following the administration of several dosing regimens using two specific PK/PD targets of AUC24/MIC > 28.2 for P. aeruginosa and 42.8 for S. aureus. As mentioned earlier, A. baumannii was not included in our PTA analysis due to the lack of a PK/PD index for this pathogen. Since our analysis relies on pathogen-specific PK/PD indices, extrapolating our findings to A. baumannii is not currently feasible. However, if a PK/PD index is established in the future, our model can be used to determine the appropriate dose for treating HAP caused by A. baumannii.\n\n## PTA evaluation against \nFigure 6 shows the PTA versus MIC profiles for various dosing regimens. PTA percentages in plasma for both healthy and pneumonia populations are higher than in ELF for healthy subjects and even more so than the ELF of pneumonia patients, especially at higher MIC values. For example, at MIC90 (8\u201364 mg/L), the concentration that inhibits 90% of the tested strains, the PTA in plasma after the administration of 8 g q8h is 100% compared with 0% in ELF in healthy and pneumonia populations. Despite this variation, all dosing regimens achieved 100% PTA in both plasma and ELF for both healthy and pneumonia populations at MIC50 (4 mg/L), the level that inhibits 50% of the tested strains. A heatmap of the PTA of fosfomycin over a wide MIC range, with six different dosing regimens in plasma and ELF for healthy and pneumonia populations, is shown in Table S3 in the supplementary material. Furthermore, Table 4 lists the breakpoint values that could be achieved following the evaluated dosing regimens. The breakpoints in plasma are consistently higher than those in the ELF for both healthy and pneumonia populations.\n\n## PTA evaluation against \nFigure 7 shows the PTA versus MIC profiles for various dosing regimens. PTA percentages in plasma for both healthy and pneumonia populations are higher than in the ELF for healthy and pneumonia patients, even at MIC values below MIC50 (32\u201364 mg/L). For example, at an MIC50 of 32 mg/L, the PTA in plasma after administering 4 g q8h is 100%, while the PTA in ELF is approximately 0% for both healthy subjects and pneumonia patients. A heatmap of the PTA of fosfomycin over a wide range of the MIC values following the administration of six different dosing regimens in plasma and ELF for both healthy and pneumonia populations is presented in Table S3 in the supplementary material. Table 4 provides the breakpoint values that could be reached following the administration of the evaluated dosing regimens. As expected, the breakpoints in plasma are consistently higher than those in the ELF for both healthy and pneumonia populations. Additionally, none of the evaluated dosing regimens achieved the breakpoints equal to MIC90 (64\u2013128 mg/L) in the ELF, while a dose of 5, 6, or 8 g q8h, and 8 or 10 g q12h\u2014each infused over 1 h resulted in a breakpoint of 64 mg/L in plasma for both healthy and pneumonia populations.\n\n## DISCUSSION\nIn this study, we successfully developed a m-PBPK model that adequately characterized the intrapulmonary PK of fosfomycin in humans. Although there are several modeling reports on the intrapulmonary PK of multiple antibiotics available in the literature (39\u201342), most of them focus on conventional compartment models that lack mechanistic insight, adaptability, and extrapolability. In contrast, our m-PBPK model was based on the anatomical structure of the lung, enhancing its physiological relevance. Due to its mechanistic and physiological nature, the PBPK model, including the m-PBPK model, can be extrapolated from one species to another species (e.g., interspecies scaling from animal to human), or different age groups within the same species (e.g., dose extrapolation from adult to infant), or from one population to another population, such as from healthy adults to pneumonia patients as we presented in the current study. Leveraging the advantage of an m-PBPK model, we were able to perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of several pathophysiological conditions on the intrapulmonary PK of fosfomycin in the target population (i.e., patients with pneumonia), through which we gained a deeper understanding of fosfomycin exposure at the site of infection.\nOur sensitivity analysis revealed that during infection, drug concentrations at the infection site decrease, whereas drug concentrations in plasma remain unchanged. This finding underscores the importance of assessing drug efficacy at the infection site rather than relying on plasma data alone, as plasma concentration may overestimate the drug\u2019s effectiveness. For instance, in healthy participants, fosfomycin levels in the ELF are lower than in plasma due to restricted penetration across the alveolar membrane, primarily caused by tight junctions. Additionally, the hydrophilic nature of fosfomycin further limits its distribution into the ELF. During infection, ELF concentrations are expected to decline further due to pathophysiological changes, such as increased alveolar fluid volume, leading to drug dilution and surfactant deactivation, reducing drug partitioning into the ELF. The sensitivity analysis strengthened our understanding of fosfomycin\u2019s intrapulmonary PK during infection and enabled us to propose a dosing regimen tailored for pneumonia patients by incorporating the pathophysiological changes that occur during infection. As such, it was instrumental in evaluating the PTA% for fosfomycin in both plasma and ELF for healthy individuals and pneumonia patients.\nWhile we recognize the significance of drug concentration at the infection site, it\u2019s still unclear if they truly reflect fosfomycin effectiveness against the main HAP pathogens. Currently, no PK/PD indices for fosfomycin derived from ELF concentrations have been established using an in vivo pneumonia infection model. Fosfomycin\u2019s antimicrobial efficacy against HAP pathogens has primarily been assessed through PK/PD indices derived from in vitro models or plasma measurements in in vivo thigh infection models (35, 36). Although these models provide valuable insights, they may not fully capture the unique anatomy and physiology of the lungs. Ideally, PK/PD relationships for fosfomycin should be investigated using an in vivo pulmonary infection model to derive a PK/PD index directly from the infection site. Such data would be crucial for accurately establishing dosing recommendations for clinical studies.\nOur PTA results indicate that for treating HAP caused by P. aeruginosa, if plasma concentrations are the most reliable indicator of fosfomycin\u2019s antimicrobial efficacy, all evaluated dosing regimens successfully achieved target attainment at MIC values up to the MIC50 for P. aeruginosa (32\u201364 mg/L), particularly at 32 mg/L. This suggests that a dose of 4 g q8h administered as a 1 h infusion could be considered as an appropriate therapy for achieving effective plasma concentrations in both healthy and pneumonia populations. However, if drug concentrations in the ELF are the more accurate predictor of therapeutic efficacy, a higher dose, specifically, 6 g q8h administered over a 1 h infusion, would be required to achieve comparable target attainment. Due to the expected reduction in ELF concentrations in pneumonia patients, even higher doses might be needed in this population. Specifically, we recommend a dose of 8 g q8h administered over a 1 h infusion to achieve sufficient target attainment at MIC values up to 32 mg/L.\nDetermining an appropriate dose regimen for HAP caused by S. aureus was more straightforward, as there was consistency between the PTA percentages in both plasma and ELF for healthy individuals and pneumonia patients at MIC values up to the MIC50 (4 mg/L). As a result, a dose of 4 g q8h, infused over 1 h could be administered to achieve adequate concentrations in both plasma and ELF in these populations.\nAlthough we evaluated a wide range of MIC values, we primarily focused on MIC50 for dosing recommendations. For institutions with their own fosfomycin MIC distribution data, our PTA results can serve as a useful reference to guide physicians in selecting appropriate dosing regimens for different stages of pneumonia. To facilitate these dosing decisions,",
