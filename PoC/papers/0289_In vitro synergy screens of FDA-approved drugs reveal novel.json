Drug repurposing could accelerate the development of new urgently needed successful interventions. This work aimed to identify and characterise novel drug combinations against Klebsiella pneumoniae based on the concepts of synergy and drug repurposing. We first performed a semi-qualitative high-throughput synergy screen (sHTSS) with tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin (last-line antibiotics against MDR Enterobacteriaceae) against a FDA-library containing 1430 clinically approved drugs; a total of 109 compounds potentiated any of the last-line antibiotics. Selected hits were further validated by secondary checkerboard (CBA) and time-kill (TKA) assays, obtaining 15.09% and 65.85% confirmation rates, respectively. Accordingly, TKA were used for synergy classification based on determination of bactericidal activities at 8, 24 and 48 h, selecting 27 combinations against K. pneumoniae. Among them, zidovudine or azithromycin combinations with last-line antibiotics were further evaluated by TKA against a panel of 12 MDR/XDR K. pneumoniae strains, and their activities confronted with those clinical combinations currently used for MDR enterobacteria treatment; these combinations showed better bactericidal activities than usual treatments without added cytotoxicity. Our studies show that sHTSS paired to TKA are powerful tools for the identification and characterisation of novel synergistic drug combinations against K. pneumoniae. Further pre-clinical studies might support the translational potential of zidovudine- and azithromycin-based combinations for the treatment of these infections.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health problem. There were an estimated 4.95 million deaths worldwide associated with bacterial AMR in 2019, including 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to bacterial AMR1. In the European Union (EU), AMR is responsible for about 33,000 deaths and 1.1 billion Euros of costs to EU health care systems each year2. Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae causes severe infections associated with 23\u201375% mortality rates3. In fact, it is considered among the most concerning pathogens with worldwide prevalence of carbapenem resistance infections increasing more than 7-fold in the EU since 2006. In addition, resistance to two or more antimicrobial groups is a growing concern4, 5.\nThe emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) enterobacteria to most available antibiotics severely limits therapeutic options of infections caused by these pathogens. Clinicians are thus forced to use last-line antibiotics in combination therapy with uncertain success rates6, 7. In 2017, WHO highlighted drug-resistant enterobacteria as priority pathogens for which new antibiotics were urgently required8; however, the traditional process of drug discovery and development is long and costly9, 10. Although a few new clinical options have been recently approved, scarce evidence and lack of randomized clinical trials prevent from establishing optimal clinical guidelines. New strategies changing the current paradigm are urgently needed11.\nDrug repurposing is an attractive approach that allows faster clinical implementation, since pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) parameters and toxicity packages are already defined in commercialized drugs12. The search for synergistic interactions has also emerged as a favourable approach to enhance the activity of drugs in combinatorial therapy in two different manners: first, expanding the therapeutic range of drugs whose potential use may be limited by toxicity issues and, second, by rescuing antimicrobials that do not reach efficacy breakpoints. Thus, synergistic combinations might show similar efficacy at lower, non-toxic doses. In addition, the use of combinatorial therapy might prevent the development of resistance derived from monotherapy13.\nIn this study, we aimed to identify partners that could potentiate the activity of tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin, three last-line antibiotics currently used to treat infections caused by MDR K. pneumoniae. For this, we performed a semi high-throughput synergy screen (sHTSS) of a library of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved compounds in combination with tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin14. Lead combinations were validated by checkerboard (CBA) and time-kill (TKA) assays. Synergistic and killing effects were evaluated at different time points to obtain a priority list of combinations. Among them, zidovudine and azithromycin resulted in the most potent synergistic partners of the three antimicrobials with the highest potential for clinical translation. Combinations based on zidovudine and azithromycin were further characterised for cytotoxicity and in vitro activity against a panel of antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae strains; their activities were also compared with usual last-resort combination treatments for MDR enterobacteria and proved to be superior.\n\n## Bacterial strains, media and chemicals\nThe K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 strain was used for the sHTSS and first validation step by CBA. For the characterisation of zidovudine- or azithromycin-based combinations, a well-characterised set of 12 K. pneumoniae strains (eight from clinical isolates and four from quality assessment exercises), classified as MDR/XDR15, was provided by the Miguel Servet University Hospital (Zaragoza, Spain) (Table S1). Bacterial identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany) and antimicrobial susceptibility by an automated broth microdilution method (Microscan Walkaway\u00ae, Beckman Coulter, Spain). Phenotypic detection of Extended-Spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL), AmpC, carbapenemases and colistin resistance was done according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) guidelines16. Genotypic characterisation of the resistance mechanisms was performed at the National Microbiology Centre (Majadahonda, Spain).\nBacterial stocks (15% glycerol) were preserved at \u2013 20\u00a0\u00b0C in Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) broth. A new stock was thawed for every experiment to ensure assay robustness, and sub-cultured on Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) for 24 h before performing each Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), CBA and TKA assay. Drug susceptibility testing in solid media and sHTSS were performed in Mueller\u2013Hinton agar (MHA). All cultures were incubated at 36\u201337\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe FDA-approved drug library was purchased from Selleckchem (catalogue #L1300). Drugs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany), except tigecycline and ceftazidime (European Pharmacopoeia, Strasbourg, France), meropenem (Fresenius Kabi), ertapenem (MSD) and avibactam (AdooQ BioScience, Irvine, USA). Stock solutions were prepared fresh on the same day of plate inoculation after drug solubilization in DMSO or water.\n\n## Drug susceptibility testing\nDetermination of MIC on liquid media\u00a0was\u00a0performed by broth microdilution in cation-adjusted MHB (CAMHB) according to Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines17 by using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay14, 18. Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions of drugs were inoculated with 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 Colony Forming Units (CFU) per mL (OD550\u2009=\u20090.2 corresponded to 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 cell/mL) in 96-well plates (VF\u2009=\u2009150 \u00b5L/well) and incubated for 18\u201320\u00a0h. For fosfomycin and ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility tests, CAMHB was supplemented with 25\u00a0mg/L of glucose-6-phosphate and 4\u00a0mg/L of avibactam, respectively, according to EUCAST guidelines19. After incubation, 30 \u03bcL/well of 5\u00a0mg/mL MTT plus 20% Tween 80 were added and incubated for 3\u00a0h. MIC values were defined as the lowest concentration of drug that inhibited 90% of the OD580 MTT colour conversion (IC90) compared to growth control wells with no drug added.MIC determinations on solid media were performed by the agar dilution method17. Briefly, 24-well plates containing MHA with serial two-fold dilutions of tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin were prepared in duplicates (VF\u2009=\u20091\u00a0mL/well). Upon agar solidification, each well was inoculated with 10 \u00b5L of a bacterial suspension (ca. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103\u00a0CFU/well) and plates incubated for 18\u201320\u00a0h. Alternatively, plates were prepared as described below (see Semi High-Throughput Synergy Screen) to calculate the sub-inhibitory MICs. The MIC was considered as the lowest value that completely inhibited visible growth.The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined to discern bacteriostatic from bactericidal activities. Prior to MTT addition, 10 \u03bcL/well were transferred to 96-well LB agar plates and further incubated for 24\u00a0h before addition of resazurin (30 \u03bcL/well). MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of drug preventing a colour change from blue to pink. A compound was considered bactericidal when MBC/MIC\u2009\u2264\u2009414.\n\n## Semi high-throughput synergy screen (sHTSS)\nThe FDA library (n\u2009=\u20091430, 10 mM) was screened to identify synergistic partners of tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin (Primary Compounds, PCs) against K. pneumoniae14. Briefly, an overnight culture of K. pneumoniae was diluted to 105 cells/mL in 22 mL of MHB medium containing 0.5% agar (top agar) and uniformly poured over 45 mL of MHB-1.5% agar (bottom agar) in duplicate OmniTrays (Nunc). PCs were added to the bottom agar at sub-inhibitory concentrations (MICsub) of 0.125 and 0.25 mg/L for tigecycline, 0.003 and 0.007 mg/L for colistin and 16 and 32 mg/L for fosfomycin, which corresponded to concentration range between 1/8\u2009\u00d7\u2009and 1/2\u2009\u00d7\u2009the MIC values by sHTSS of the compounds alone (Table S2).\nFDA-library compounds (0.1 and 1 mM) were transferred from 96-well tester plates onto top agar cell lawns using a pin replicator (1.6 mm pin diameter), which transferred approximately 200 nL/pin (0.2\u20132 nmol of each compound). OmniTrays were incubated overnight before inhibition zones measurement. Synergy was illustrated by an increase of the inhibition zones in the PC-containing agar plates (Figure S1).\nHits were classified in four categories: (1) synergy (Y): compounds whose inhibition zones increased at the two PCs MICsub tested (diameter MICsub1 and diameter MICsub2\u2009>\u2009diameterControl); (2) likely synergy (Y/N): compounds whose inhibition zones increased at only one PC MICsub (diameter MICsub1 or diameter MICsub2\u2009>\u2009diameterControl); (3) no interaction (N): compounds with no change in their inhibition zones (diameter MICsub1 and diameter MICsub2\u2009=\u2009diameterControl); and, (4) likely antagonism (A): compounds with decreased inhibition zones (diameter MICsub1 and diameter MICsub2\u2009<\u2009diameterControl).\n\n## Secondary validation assays\nCheckerboard assays. CBA were performed in 96-well plates using freshly prepared CAMHB. Each well was inoculated with 100 \u00b5L of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u00a0CFU/mL (VF\u2009=\u2009200 \u00b5L). Pre-inocula were prepared by direct suspension of bacteria grown overnight in MHB and plates incubated for 24\u00a0h before determination of the compound activities alone and in combination14, 18. Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Indexes (FICI) were calculated as:FICI\u2009=\u2009FICA\u2009+\u2009FICBFICA\u2009=\u2009[MICA in the presence of B]/MICAFICB\u2009=\u2009[MICB in the presence of A]/MICB\nSynergy was defined as FICI\u2009\u2264\u20090.5, antagonism as FICI\u2009>\u20094.0, and no interaction when the FICI was between 0.5 and 4.020. Similarly, the Fractional Bactericidal Concentration Index (FBCI) was calculated as above described based on MBC values for each combination using the resazurin method18.\nTime-kill assays. Duplicates of exponentially growing K. pneumoniae cultures were inoculated in CAMHB 96-well plates (VF\u2009=\u2009280 \u00b5L/well; 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u00a0CFU/mL) containing increasing compound concentrations (0.1\u00d7, 0.25\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 10\u00d7 MIC values) of compounds alone or in pairwise or triple combinations. At predefined time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48\u00a0h), the bacterial population from each well was quantified by spot-platting 10-fold serial dilutions on MHA plates. Plates were incubated overnight, and CFU/mL calculated; the lower limit of detection was 50\u00a0CFU/mL. Combo test concentrations were selected based on dose\u2013response curves of the compound alone (typically 0.25\u00d7 MIC and/or 1\u00d7 MIC) or up to 300\u00a0mg/L in the case of inactive hits. Zidovudine combinations were tested against the 12 strains (including those showing high-level zidovudine resistance) at concentrations up to 1\u00a0mg/L to match physiological relevant concentrations; i.e., maximum concentration (Cmax) of zidovudine observed in human plasma after intravenously administration (1.1\u20131.8\u00a0mg/L)21. MIC assays were run in parallel with the same inoculum as internal controls of compound activity. Synergistic and bactericidal activities were evaluated after 8, 24 and 48\u00a0h of incubation. A synergistic combination was defined as a\u2009\u2265\u20092 log10 CFU/mL decrease in the bacterial count of the combination compared to the most active single agent at any time point (8, 24 and 48\u00a0h). Antagonism was defined as a\u2009\u2265\u20092 log10 increase in CFU/mL between the combination and the most active single agent. All other cases were defined as indifferent. Bactericidal activity was defined as a\u2009\u2265\u20093 log10 CFU/mL reduction at any time point (8, 24 and 48\u00a0h) compared to the initial inoculum22.\n\n## Cytotoxicity assays\nThe MTT cytotoxicity test23 was used to determine the cytotoxicity of the azithromycin- and zidovudine-based combinations in the HepG2 cell line (human liver carcinoma cells from ECACC: cat. N\u00b0 85011430). Stock cells were cryopreserved in 90% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) plus 10% DMSO. Cells were thawed from stocks and cultured in flasks with pre-warmed (37\u00a0\u00b0C) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Glutamax and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin, penicillin and ciprofloxacin for 24 h in a controlled 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Two passages were performed before the cytotoxicity assays. After microscopic evaluation of a semi-confluent monolayer, cells were removed by enzymatic digestion with 0.05% trypsin\u2013EDTA solution (5 min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C) and then neutralized with supplemented DMEM. Cells were centrifuged (240g, 5 min) and the medium replaced to adjust the cell suspension to 106 cells per plate. Cells were seeded in 96-well flat bottom plates transferring 100 \u00b5L per well (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells) and incubated under conditions described above. After 24 h, media was aspirated and replaced by fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Glutamax and containing the compounds dissolved. Compounds were added both alone and in combination at the same concentrations used in the TKA. Growth controls and blanks with medium were also included in the plate layout. Cells were incubated for additional 24 h and then, 10 \u00b5L of MTT dissolved in PBS (5 mg/mL) added to each well. Plates were further incubated for 2 h before the MTT solution was removed and MTT crystals solubilized in 100 \u00b5L/well of DMSO, mixed and the absorbance measured (OD570 and OD650). The percentage of cell viability was determined based on the untreated controls. Treatments were considered cytotoxic when cell viability was reduced to\u2009<\u200970% of the growth controls, according to the international standard protocols23. Experiments were performed in technical triplicates and biological replicates. Graphical representation and statistical analysis to compare each concentration were performed by one-way ANOVA test in GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0.2).\n\n## Synergy screens of the FDA library in combination with last-line antibiotics identified novel combinations against \nThe MIC of the three PCs (colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline) was determined in liquid and solid media; MIC values were also determined under the same conditions used in the sHTSS. By this method, we observed a 100-fold higher activity for colistin compared to its activity in both liquid and solid media (Table S2). This could be explained by differences in the drug distribution or growth state of the bacteria, since in the sHTSS method cells are embedded in soft agar instead of growing on the agar surface.\nOverall, 109 FDA compounds enhanced the activity of the PCs with hit discovery rates of 2.59% (n\u2009=\u200937), 2.17% (n\u2009=\u200931), and 2.87% (n\u2009=\u200941) for tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin, respectively. According to the interaction ranking criteria (see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d), 19, 9 and 18 interactions were classified as synergistic, and 18, 22 and 23 as likely synergistic with tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin, respectively. Additionally, 6, 10 and 12 interactions were classified as likely antagonistic with tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin, respectively. We found some promiscuous compounds able to enhance the activity of more than one PC; thereby, among the 109 compounds that initially enhanced the activity of any of the PCs, there were 60 unique hits. Classification by their therapeutic use revealed most hits were known antibacterial agents (75%), including quinolones (n\u2009=\u200916), \u03b2-lactams (n\u2009=\u200912) and aminoglycosides (n\u2009=\u20096), with non-antibacterial compounds (n\u2009=\u200915) including other anti-infective agents (7%), antineoplastics (7%) or antipsychotics (3%), among others. Percentages were similar among the three PCs (Fig.\u00a01). A comprehensive hit list, inhibition zones and correlation with secondary validation assays are displayed in Table S3.Figure 1FDA compounds with favourable interactions with tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin identified by sHTSS and classified by their therapeutic use. Other anti-infective agents include anti-parasitic, antiseptic and antiviral agents. Duplicate hits were removed from analysis. sHTSS semi-high throughput synergy screen.\n\n## Checkerboard assay displayed low validation rates\nFifty-three sHTSS interactions classified as synergy (n\u2009=\u200950) or antagonism (n\u2009=\u20093) for any of the PCs were evaluated by CBA. FICI and FBCI indexes were calculated based on their MIC and MBC values, respectively (Table S4). Interactions were validated in 8 out of the 53 (15.09%) combinations. However, only those of colistin showed a certain degree of validation (7 out of 12 combinations tested, 58.33%), while no validation was observed with tigecycline (0 out of 16) or fosfomycin (1 out of 25) (Table S5).\n\n## Time-kill studies revealed novel promising pairwise combinations against \nForty-one combinations (35 classified as \u201cY\u201d or \u201cY/N\u201d and 6 as \u201cA\u201d, see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d) were studied by TKA to assess their pharmacological and clinical translation potential (Fig.\u00a02; Table S6). Overall, TKA showed a synergy validation rate of 65.85% (27 out of 41 combinations) at any of the predefined time points. Specific confirmation rates for each PC were 72.72% (8/11) for colistin, 70.58% (12/17) for fosfomycin, and 53.84% (7/13) for tigecycline (Table S5). Effective combinations were identified with antimicrobials such as azithromycin (displaying potent synergistic and bactericidal activities with all three PCs). Levofloxacin, furazolidone and the antiseptic triclosan were specific of colistin, while fosfomycin combinations with cefdinir, ceftriaxone, doripenem, lomefloxacin and moxalactam showed potent synergistic interactions at the later time points, reaching the limit of detection. Tigecycline showed some degree of interaction with aztreonam, tobramycin, cephradine, or levofloxacin (Fig.\u00a02). Interestingly, novel synergistic interactions with non-antibiotic drugs were confirmed in these studies, including colistin plus the antineoplastic bleomycin or the antiparasitic ivermectin, fosfomycin plus bleomycin, pralidoxime (a poisoning antidote) or zidovudine24, and tigecycline combined with bisphosphonate ibandronate or the antipsychotic penfluridol (Fig.\u00a03).Figure 2TKA drug interaction map of sHTSS hits. Forty-one sHTSS hits were selected for secondary validation TKA based on pharmacological and clinical translation potential assessments. Drug interaction was assessed after 8, 24 and 48 h. The degree of interaction was determined as the log10CFU/mL increased reduction between the combo and the most active agent alone (see figure inset). Combinations that kill down to the limit of detection were marked by an asterisk.Figure 3Novel combinations of non-antibiotic drugs with the PCs against K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883. (a,b) Colistin combined with bleomycin or ivermectin. Bleomycin strongly enhanced colistin to the limit of detection; ivermectin showed synergy up to 8\u00a0h of incubation with colistin, after this time point a rebound was observed, similarly to both compounds alone; (c,d) Fosfomycin combined with bleomycin (bactericidal from early hours) or pralidoxime showed synergy with fosfomycin at 8\u00a0h, followed by a rebound (e,f) Tigecycline combined with ibandronate or penfluridol showed static activity and synergy at 48\u00a0h.

MIC values of zidovudine (MICZDV) ranged from 0.25 to\u2009\u2265\u200964\u00a0mg/L, with nine strains showing low MICZDV values (0.25\u20132\u00a0mg/L) and three MIC values\u2009\u2265\u200916\u00a0mg/L; in consequence, a concentration of\u00a02\u00a0mg/L was used in this study as a possible cut-off for zidovudine resistance. MIC values of azithromycin (MICAZM) ranged from 4 to\u2009\u2265\u200964\u00a0mg/L, with ten strains showing MICAZM values lower than 8\u00a0mg/L and only two with MIC values\u2009\u2265\u200964\u00a0mg/L. There are no CLSI or EUCAST guidelines describing azithromycin clinical breakpoints for enterobacteria, except for Salmonella Typhi and Shigella spp.25. However, in our experiments, azithromycin exhibited a clear cut-off at 8\u201316\u00a0mg/L, which were in the same range of values as those epidemiological cut-offs (ECOFFs) stablished by EUCAST for azithromycin in other enterobacteria26. The activity of zidovudine and azithromycin was thus in the same concentration range (low mg/L) of other currently used last-line antibiotics (Table S7).\nThen, zidovudine- and azithromycin-based pairwise combinations were tested against the same panel of strains. In order to understand the potential translational impact of these combinations and provide a temporal component to the interaction analysis, we compared their activities with those\u00a0of the current clinically used last-resort combinations against infections caused by MDR/XDR K. pneumoniae by time-kill assays (Fig.\u00a04). At any time-point (8, 24 and 48\u00a0h), positive interactions and bactericidal profiles among currently used combinations for MDR treatment were observed in five and three strains for meropenem/ertapenem (41.6% and 25%), four and two strains for meropenem/colistin (33.33% and 16.6%), nine and four strains for fosfomycin/colistin (75% and 33.3%) and eight and none strains for fosfomycin/tigecycline (66.6% and 0%), respectively (Fig.\u00a04, Figure S2). In stark contrast, a high number of synergistic interactions were obtained with zidovudine and azithromycin-based combinations across all strains.Figure 4TKA heat map representation of the synergistic and bactericidal activities of clinically used versus novel combinations against K. pneumoniae strains. ZDV-based combinations were tested at concentrations\u2009\u2264\u20091 mg/L, reflecting physiologically achieved concentrations. The most favourable outcome is displayed when several concentrations were tested for the same drug. CAZ-AVI ceftazidime-avibactam, CST colistin, ETP ertapenem, FOF fosfomycin, MEM meropenem, TGC tigecycline, ZDV zidovudine, AZM azithromycin. Data supporting this summary figure is displayed in Figures S2, S3 and S4.\nFor the zidovudine combinations, ceftazidime-avibactam plus zidovudine was the most active among all strains, showing a positive interaction in 10 out of 12 (83.3%). In eight of the strains (66.6%) the killing activity was below the limit of detection after 24\u00a0h of incubation, preventing bacterial regrowth (a proxy for sterilizing activity). The combination of fosfomycin plus zidovudine was synergistic in 9 out of 12 strains (75%), showing a potent and rapid initial decrease in bacterial counts after 8\u00a0h in four strains and bactericidal activity down to the limit of detection in six strains. The combination of zidovudine plus colistin was synergistic in 9 out of 12 (75%) strains with killing activity to the limit of detection in four (33.3%). Finally, zidovudine plus tigecycline was the less potent with late synergy (48\u00a0h) in 7 out of 12 strains (58.3%), being bactericidal only against the C-7 strain (Fig.\u00a04, Figure S3).\nFor the azithromycin combinations, azithromycin plus fosfomycin was the most potent, showing positive interactions at any time point in all the strains tested and bactericidal in 10 out of the 12 strains (83.3%). The potency of this combination was evident when compared to the activity of the drugs alone; neither showed long-lasting bactericidal activity, with a static effect or no activity (azithromycin), and rapid bactericidal activity followed by bacterial regrowth from the 8-h time-point (fosfomycin). In addition, in most strains combined bactericidal effects were already detected at early time points (4\u20138\u00a0h). The combination azithromycin/colistin was synergistic at any time point in 7 out of 12 (58.3%) and bactericidal in 8 out of the 12 strains (66.6%), including two colistin-resistant strains that had viable counts below the limit of detection (50\u00a0CFU/mL). The combination azithromycin/tigecycline was synergistic at any time point against 9 out the 12 (75%) strains, being bactericidal in three strains (E-2, A-6 and CEE-11) (Fig.\u00a04, Figure S4).\nThe strong interaction observed in the zidovudine- and azithromycin-based combinations was maintained even in those strains (CE-10 and CEE-11) with high MIC values for both compounds. Even at concentrations at which zidovudine or azithromycin had minor antibacterial effects, the combinations (except zidovudine/tigecycline) were synergistic and highly bactericidal, indicating that these treatments can overcome resistance (Fig.\u00a05).Figure 5Zidovudine- and azithromycin-based combinations are active against K. pneumoniae strains resistant to zidovudine and azithromycin. (a) Zidovudine enhanced the activities of ceftazidime-avibactam, fosfomycin and colistin even at low sub-inhibitory concentrations (0.004\u20130.015xMICZDV), against CE-10 (blaOXA-48\u2009+\u2009blaCTX-M15). MICCAZ-AVI\u2009=\u20090.25 mg/L, MICCST\u2009=\u20091 mg/L, MICFOF\u2009=\u200964 mg/L, MICTGC\u2009=\u20091 mg/L, MICZDV\u2009=\u200964 mg/L; (b) azithromycin enhanced the activities of fosfomycin, colistin and tigecycline at subinhibitory concentration (0.25\u20131xMICAZM) against CEE-11 (blaKPC-3\u2009+\u2009blaSHV-1\u2009+\u2009blaTEM-1). MICAZM\u2009\u2265\u200964 mg/L, MICCST\u2009=\u20092 mg/L, MICFOF\u2009>\u200964 mg/L, MICTGC\u2009=\u20094 mg/L.

We showed that, while carbapenem-based combinations had little synergistic interaction profiles, the combination of two last-line antibiotics (fosfomycin/colistin) had an overall synergy rate of 75% and that zidovudine displayed strong synergy with both drugs (Fig.\u00a04). We thus aimed to characterise whether the addition of zidovudine to the fosfomycin/colistin combination could further potentiate their synergistic interactions, as previously described14, 27, 28. The triple combination was highly active showing positive interactions in 7 out of the 8 (87.5%) strains tested and bactericidal activities in 4 out of 8 (50%). The triple combination was superior to the colistin/zidovudine and fosfomycin/colistin pairwise combos but added little or no benefit compared to the fosfomycin/zidovudine combo (Fig.\u00a06).Figure 6TKA heat map representation of the synergistic and bactericidal activities of the triple fosfomycin/colistin/zidovudine combination compared to the pairwise combination against eight K. pneumoniae strains. Combo tested concentrations at 0.25\u20131\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC. Data supporting this summary figure is displayed in Figure S5.

Cell viability was\u2009>\u200970% (which is considered non-cytotoxic according to standard international protocols23) for most drugs and combinations tested. Only tigecycline, out of the three last-line antibiotics, was cytotoxic at 4\u00a0mg/L (40% cell viability), but not at 2\u00a0mg/L (>\u200990% cell viability), which is near to the mean Cmax described after standard intravenous dose of 100\u00a0mg of tigecycline (1.45\u00a0mg/L)29. Zidovudine and azithromycin were cytotoxic at the highest concentration tested (64\u00a0mg/L) (<\u200940% cell viability), but not at any of the lowest concentrations used in the combinations. The combination might be even beneficial since zidovudine toxicity was reduced in the case of zidovudine plus fosfomycin. Importantly, no combination was more cytotoxic than the drugs alone in the same combination (Fig.\u00a07).Figure 7Cytotoxicity of zidovudine- and azithromycin-based combinations in a HepG2 cell line.

Here, we adapted the sHTSS methodology to find active combinations against K. pneumoniae. sHTSS allowed for rapid and clear drug interaction readouts derived from inhibition zones in agar media. A general overview of the screening and validation progression cascade is displayed in Fig.\u00a08, with Table S5 displaying a more comprehensive summary.Figure 8Synergy screen progression cascade. Screening activities were performed with K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883. The number of compounds tested, hit rates and hits validated are indicated at every step. TGC tigecycline, CST colistin, FOF fosfomycin, TKA time-kill assay.\nOur screens in K. pneumoniae yielded hit rates ranging from 2.17 to 2.87%, higher than that observed in M. smegmatis (1.4%)14, but similar to other studies against Gram-negative bacilli with comparable hit rates (1.87%, tigecycline/5.54%, colistin)30. A large proportion were known antimicrobial drugs (82%), including antibacterial (75%) and other anti-infective agents (7%) (Fig.\u00a01). The overrepresentation of antimicrobials in synergy screening programs enhancing the activity of other antimicrobials is similarly described in other studies with K. pneumoniae30, 31 and M. smegmatis14. Hind et al. observed this finding specially associated with K. pneumoniae, while they identified more heterogeneous ",
