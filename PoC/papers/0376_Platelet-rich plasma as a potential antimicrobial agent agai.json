Bacterial isolates resistant to commonly used antimicrobial drugs are becoming more prevalent in DFIs. Some research suggests that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may inhibit bacterial growth, making it a promising biological therapy. Therefore, an in vitro experimental study was conducted on 53 multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial strains isolated from DFIs.

The antibacterial activity of PRP was assessed using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, broth microdilution method, checkerboard synergy testing, and time-kill assay. The time-kill assay demonstrated that PRP's antibacterial efficacy peaked during the second hour of incubation for MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but peaked at the first hour for Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the PPR's efficiency against all isolates decreased after the peak point, with no antibacterial activity observed at the 24th h of incubation. Additionally, biofilm inhibition and eradication assays revealed that PRP has no effect on biofilm formation. As a result, PRP has the ability to inhibit bacterial growth, although this effect is transient and depends on the bacterial strain.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) constitutes a significant public health issue, ranking among the most prevalent and serious chronic diseases of the 21st century1. Complications of DM, which are frequently debilitating, life-threatening, and financially burdensome, are rising in both developed and developing nations2. The latest statistics from the 10th edition of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) Diabetes Atlas indicates that around 536.6\u00a0million adults are presently affected by DM, with projections suggesting an increase to 783.2\u00a0million by 20453.\nPatients with DM face a 25% risk of developing foot ulcers, half of which are infected at diagnosis, leading to substantial morbidity, with 1 in 5 cases culminating in lower extremity amputation4,5. Diabetic foot infections (DFIs) can be caused by bacteria from the external environment as well as from the normal flora of the skin. Notably, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are prevalent in DFIs. These MDR bacteria are virulent pathogens that resist most conventionally prescribed antibiotics. They are also considered to be among the clinically significant pathogens involved in biofilm formation associated with infections, which complicates ulcer management and increases healthcare costs6,7.\nPlatelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous derivative of whole blood, with platelet concentrations higher than normal. It contains a complete set of clotting factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other plasma proteins8\u201310. It is also rich in growth factors (GFs), so it shows promise in the healing of various organs. Consequently, its application has significantly expanded in dermatology, reconstructive plastic surgery, orthopedics, spine surgery, sports medicine, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and ophthalmology7,11.\nCurrent evidence suggests that PRP is a good antimicrobial agent that could aid in preventing infections and treating chronic wounds or bone infections12\u201315. The advantages of PRP include its affordability, ease of preparation, low likelihood of inducing antibiotic resistance, and autologous nature, ensuring safety16. Additionally, it has demonstrated efficacy against biofilm-producing microorganisms, which is essential for treating infections effectively17,18.\nDespite the numerous advantages associated with PRP and the promising outcomes reported for its therapeutic potential, the clinical results vary widely and can even be contradictory. These conflicting findings arise from differences in the clinical protocols used, making it challenging to compare results and establish definite conclusions regarding their actual effectiveness. Additionally, the lack of standardization in PRP preparation procedures further highlights this issue. As a result, a wide array of products with various cell types, quantities, GFs, cytokine contents, and release times are available19\u201321.\nAlthough PRP has been suggested as a treatment for clean diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and studies have revealed the antimicrobial activity of PRP on various microorganisms, such as Streptococcus oralis and Candida albicans11,12,22,23, limited research has examined resistant microorganisms that may endure prolonged periods and are challenging to manage in wound infections17,24. Consequently, further investigation is required to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial efficacy of PRP against MDR bacteria, facilitating prospective clinical studies and targeted PRP therapies in DFIs.\n\n## Results\nThe present study was conducted over the period from April 2021 to May 2022 in the Microbiology Laboratory at at the High Institute of Public Health (HIPH) and the Clinical Pathology Laboratory at Alexandria Main University Hospital (AMUH) to determine the antimicrobial activity of PRP against 53 MDR bacteria isolated from infected diabetic foot ulcers.\nSamples were collected from 78 DFIs of patients admitted to the Vascular Surgery and Diabetic Foot Unit at the Surgery Department in AMUH. All samples were subjected to the standard microbiological procedures for isolation and identification of bacterial agents. Bacterial isolates other than MRSA, MDR K. pneumoniae, and MDR P. aeruginosa were excluded from the PRP experimental study.\nAmong 21 MDR K. pneumoniae isolates, 11 (52.40%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, and among 16 MDR P. aeruginosa isolates, 6 (37.50%) were carbapenemase producers (Table\u00a01).\nTable 1Distribution of the 53 studied bacterial isolates, Alexandria, 2021\u20132022.Studied bacterial isolatesNo.%MRSA1630.19MDR K. pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200921) (39.62%)ESBL-producers1120.75Non ESBL-producers1018.87MDR P. aeruginosa (n\u2009=\u200916) (30.19%)Carbapenemase-producers611.32Non carbapenemase-producers1018.87Total53100.00\nFor PRP preparation, venous blood samples were obtained from 16 adult volunteers. The volunteers were all females, and the mean age was 31.17\u2009\u00b1\u20092.79 years. The mean platelet count was 233.17\u2009\u00b1\u200979.81\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L in whole blood, and increased to 823.67\u2009\u00b1\u2009282.05\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L in PRP, with an average increase of 3.53-fold in the platelet concentration after processing. The mean white blood cells (WBCs) count of whole blood was 6.48\u2009\u00b1\u20092.23\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L, and was markedly reduced to 2.31\u2009\u00b1\u20095.03\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L in PRP.\n\n## Kirby\u2013Bauer disk diffusion method\nThe average inhibition zone measured 6.00\u00a0mm (disc diameter) for non-activated PRP, activated PRP, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) against the examined isolates. No increase in the diameter of the inhibition zones was observed for the PRP-coated cefoxitin and ceftazidime discs in comparison to the uncoated antibiotic discs (Fig.\u00a01).\nFig. 1Antibacterial effect of PRP on S. aureus isolate via the disk diffusion method: empty discs were coated with one experimental PRP and an equal volume of PBS, as a control. These discs were then placed on inoculated Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) plates. Standard 6\u00a0mm antibiotic discs of cefoxitin, alone and in combination with the experimental PRP, were also placed on the same MHA plates. No increase in the diameter of the inhibition zones was observed for the PRP-coated discs in comparison to the uncoated discs.\n\n## Broth microdilution method\nUsing the broth microdilution method, all the studied MRSA, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa isolates were resistant to non-activated PRP. The activation of PRP by any of three methods (calcium gluconate, thrombin, or calcium gluconate plus thrombin) led to the formation of platelet gel, which precipitated at the bottom of the wells of microtiter plates. Therefore, the antibacterial activity of activated PRPs could not be evaluated. However, It was observed that wells containing suspensions of PRP (non-activated or activated) inoculated with P. aeruginosa presented yellow-green pigmentation compared with the dark-green pigmentation of those without PRP.\nAfter 24\u00a0h of incubation of tested mixtures (PRP plus bacterial suspensions) that were plated onto tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates to determine the bactericidal activity of PRP, the non-activated and activated PRP did not show any bactericidal activity against the MRSA, K. pneumoniae, or P. aeruginosa isolates.\n\n## Checkerboard synergy testing\nPPR-antibiotic combinations had synergistic effects on only 12.50 and 37.50% of MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. On the other hand, they had antagonistic activity against 37.50, 19.05, and 25.00% of MRSA, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. However, the outcome of the combination was indifferent to half of the MRSA (50.00%) and the majority of the K. pneumoniae (80.95%) isolates (Table\u00a02).\nTable 2Interpretation of checkerboard synergy testing of prp\u2012antibiotic combinations against the 53 studied bacterial isolates, Alexandria, 2021\u20132022.Studied bacterial IsolatesPRP-antibiotic combination*SynergisticIndifferentAntagonisticNo.%No.%No.%MRSA\u2260(n\u2009=\u200916)212.50850.00637.50K. pneumoniae\u2020(n\u2009=\u200921)00.001780.95419.05P. aeruginosa\u2020(n\u2009=\u200916)637.50637.50425.00Total (n\u2009=\u200953)815.093158.491426.42Test of significance\u03c72\u2009=\u200912.964P\nMC= 0.011\u00b0*Non-activated PRP.\u2260PRP-cefoxitin combination against MRSA.\n\u2020: PRP-ceftazidime combination against K. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa.\n\u03c72: Pearson chi-square test.\nP\nMC: Monte Carlo correction for the p value of the Pearson chi-square test.\n\u00b0: p-value is significant at level\u2009<\u20090.05.\n\n## Time-kill assay\nThe mean colony counts for MRSA isolates in the PRP group were 1.87, 1.00, 54.81, and 1000.00, while in the control group, the counts were 77.93, 192.37, 946.00, and 1000.00 at 1, 2, 5, and 24\u00a0h, respectively. The antimicrobial effect of PRP peaked at the second hour of incubation, demonstrating a reduction of over 2 logs in colony count compared to the control group, and persisted until the fifth hour of incubation. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the PPR diminished after the second hour of incubation. In comparison to the control group, the peak effectiveness of PRP inhibited approximately 99.50% of MRSA growth rate (Fig.\u00a02).\nThe mean colony counts for K. pneumoniae isolates in the PRP group were 10.66, 26.85, 516.04, and 1000.0 at 1, 2, 5, and 24\u00a0h, respectively. In the control group, the counts were 123.19, 332.52, 1000.00, and 1000.00 at the same time intervals. The antimicrobial effect of PRP peaked at one hour of incubation, demonstrating a one-log-fold reduction in colony count compared to the control group, and persisted until the fifth hour of incubation. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the PPR diminished after the initial hour of incubation. The peak effectiveness of PRP inhibited approximately 91.35% of K. pneumoniae growth compared to the control group (Fig.\u00a03).\nThe mean colony counts for P. aeruginosa isolates in the PRP group were 2.43, 2.31, 41.06, and 1000.00, while in the control group, they were 46.18, 83.43, 884.37, and 1000.00 at 1, 2, 5, and 24\u00a0h, respectively. The antimicrobial effect of PRP peaked at the second hour of incubation, demonstrating an approximate one and a half-log reduction in colony count relative to the control group, and persisted until the fifth hour of incubation. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the PPR diminished after the second hour of incubation. In comparison to the control group, the peak effectiveness of PRP inhibited approximately 97.23% of the growth rate of P. aeruginosa (Fig.\u00a04).\nThese results revealed a highly statistically significant difference in the number of colonies of MRSA. K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa isolates between the PRP and control groups after 1, 2, and 5\u00a0h of incubation (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). However, there was no statistically significant effect of PRP at 24\u00a0h of incubation (Table\u00a03).\nFig. 2Time\u2012kill curve analysis of the 16 studied MRSA isolates in the presence of PRP, Alexandria, 2021\u20132022.\nFig. 3Time\u2012kill curve analysis of the 21 studied K. pneumoniae isolates in the presence of PRP, Alexandria, 2021\u20132022.\nFig. 4Time\u2012kill curve analysis of the 16 studied P. aeruginosa isolates in the presence of PRP, Alexandria, 2021\u20132022.\nTable 3Colony counts of the 53 bacterial isolates studied in the presence of PRP\u2020 after 1, 2, 5, and 24\u00a0h of incubation on TSA, Alexandria, 2021\u20132022.Studied bacterial isolatesIncubation timeMean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (CFU/ ml)p-value of Mann-Whitney testPRP groupControl groupMRSA (n\u2009=\u200916)1\u00a0h1.87\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9477.93\u2009\u00b1\u200934.82p\u2009<\u20090.0001*2\u00a0h1.00\u2009\u00b1\u20092.90192.37\u2009\u00b1\u2009168.57p\u2009<\u20090.0001*5\u00a0h54.81\u2009\u00b1\u200956.80946.00\u2009\u00b1\u2009216.00p\u2009<\u20090.0001*24\u00a0h1000.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u03c01000.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u03c0p\u2009=\u20091.000 \u201cK. pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200921)1\u00a0h10.66\u2009\u00b1\u200915.80123.19\u2009\u00b1\u200949.08p\u2009<\u20090.0001*2\u00a0h26.85\u2009\u00b1\u200942.36332.52\u2009\u00b1\u2009251.30p\u2009<\u20090.0001*5\u00a0h516.04\u2009\u00b1\u2009475.351000.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u03c0p\u2009<\u20090.0001*24\u00a0h1000.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u03c01000.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u03c0p\u2009=\u20091.000 \u201cP. aeruginosa (n\u2009=\u200916)1\u00a0h2.43\u2009\u00b1\u2009186.0046.18\u2009\u00b1\u200970.38p\u2009<\u20090.0001*2\u00a0h2.31\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9683.43\u2009\u00b1\u2009132.43p\u2009<\u20090.0001*5\u00a0h41.06\u2009\u00b1\u200941.56884.37\u2009\u00b1\u2009316.00p\u2009<\u20090.0001*24\u00a0h1000.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u03c01000.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u03c0p\u2009=\u20091.000 \u201c\u2020Activated PRP.*Statistically significant (p-value is significant at <\u20090.05).\u201cNot statistically significant.\n\u03c0: Colony counts over 1000 were recorded as 1000.\n\n## Detection of biofilm-forming bacterial isolates\nMost of the studied isolates (n\u2009=\u200937, 69.81%) were biofilm producers. Moreover, among those biofilm-producing isolates, 11 (29.73%) were strong producers. Approximately 75.00% of the MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolates and 61.90% of the K. pneumoniae isolates were biofilm producers (Fig.\u00a05; Table\u00a04).\nFig. 5Biofilm-producing ability of the 53 bacterial isolates studied, Alexandria, 2021\u20132022.\nTable 4Biofilm-producing ability of the 53 bacterial isolates studied, Alexandria, 2021\u20132022.Studied bacterial isolatesBiofilm productionNegativeWeakModerateStrongNo%No%No%No%MRSA (n\u2009=\u200916)425531.25425318.75K. pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u200921)838.09523.81419.05419.05P. aeruginosa (n\u2009=\u200916)425531.25318.75425Total1630.191528.301120.751120.75Test of significanc\u03c72\u2009=\u20091.167P\nMC= 0.997*\u03c72:Pearson chi-square test.P\nMC: Monte Carlo correction for the p value of the Pearson chi-square test.*: p value is significant at level\u2009<\u20090.05.\n\n## Biofilm inhibition and eradication assays\nBoth non-activated and activated PRP did not affect biofilm formation or established biofilms.\n\n## Discussion\nDFIs are among the most common complications of DM24. The emergence of resistance to commonly used antibiotics has become a threat among patients with DFIs and can lead to treatment failure with poor prognosis25\u201327. The development of alternative treatment methods that may help prevent or control DFIs could have substantial clinical, social and economic effects. According to some research, PRP is an effective antimicrobial agent that may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic wound or bone infections15. PRP has major advantages over conventional antibiotic treatment for DFIs, as it is less effective at inducing bacterial resistance. In addition, PRP not only reduces infections but also promotes wound healing.\nConflicting reports exist concerning the application of PRP in the management of infected wounds. Research indicates that plasma may serve as an effective medium for bacterial proliferation and may facilitate the entrapment of microorganisms within the platelet-fibrin matrix following platelet aggregation, potentially shielding pathogens from the effects of antibiotics or leukocytes28,29. Additional research indicates that PRP exhibits bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal properties against microorganisms30\u201333.\nA standardized protocol for PRP preparation is currently lacking, which hinders the ability to compare efficacy across studies15. Amable et al. investigated fifteen distinct conditions, such as relative centrifugal force, centrifugation time, and temperature, to identify the optimal procedure for achieving the best platelet counts. The findings revealed an increase in platelet count ranging from 0.6 to 5.2-fold, contingent upon the specific conditions observed. This finding highlights that a crucial factor affecting PRP activity is the preparation process designed to achieve optimal platelet counts34. In our study, we utilized a PRP preparation protocol that resulted in an average 3.53-fold increase in platelet count compared to whole blood.\nThe role of leukocytes in PRP is controversial. Some evidence suggests that adding WBCs to PRP may boost its antimicrobial properties35. However, Anitua found that leukocytes did not significantly improve PRP\u2019s antimicrobial properties36. Since white blood cells release proinflammatory proteases and metalloproteases, higher leukocyte concentration may worsen the inflammatory response37. Thus, we used a method to generate PRP with low leukocyte concentration.\nIn the present study, PRP activation was conducted immediately prior to application by incorporating 10% calcium gluconate, autologous thrombin, or a combination of both. An autologous platelet-rich gel (APG) made from whole blood contains PRP, calcium, and thrombin. Activated PRP releases GFs, antimicrobial proteins, and inflammatory cytokines. Clean DFUs have been treated with APG for years, improving ulcer healing22,38\u201341. Bovine thrombin was initially employed as an activating agent; however, the infrequent yet significant risk of coagulopathy due to antibody formation has limited its regular application. The use of calcium gluconate in the present study offers an alternative means of in vitro activation42,43.\nIn the current study, we evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of PRP against three MDR microorganisms isolated from infected DFUs, namely, MRSA, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. The three bacterial species examined were selected because they represent the most common causes of DFIs.\nTo test the antibacterial effect of a substance, we can use different methods such as the disk diffusion method, broth dilution method, agar dilution method, or time\u2012kill assay44. We tested the in vitro antibacterial efficacy of PRP (with and without activation) via the Kirby\u2013Bauer disk diffusion method. Unfortunately, none of our PRP preparations inhibited the growth of the studied MRSA, MDR K. pneumoniae, or P. aeruginosa isolates after 24\u00a0h of incubation. The mean value of the inhibition zones against all the tested isolates was only 6.00\u00a0mm (disc diameter) for both non-activated and activated PRP-coated empty discs. In addition, there was no increase in the diameter of the inhibition zones for the PRP-coated cefoxitin and ceftazidime discs compared with the uncoated antibiotic discs. Cetinkaya et al. found a 2\u00a0mm increase in PRP-coated empty disc diameter against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa but no increase in MRSA inhibition zones45. In contrast, Bielecki et al. reported that PRP inhibited the growth of some MRSA strains via the disk diffusion method but had no effect on K. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa. Moreover, PRP induced in vitro growth of P. aeruginosa46. In the previous study, PRP was prepared manually, resulting in a lower mean platelet count (228\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L) compared to the present study. Cetinkaya et al. used an automated device to obtain PRP with concentrations seven times higher than the donor\u2019s baseline platelet count. The median platelet count in PRP was 2208\u2009\u00d7\u2009109/L. These findings suggest a potential correlation between elevated platelet counts in PRP solutions and enhanced antimicrobial effects.\nOwing to the failure of the disk diffusion method to demonstrate any antibacterial effect of PRP preparations, we tested the broth microdilution method, which in turn showed no antibacterial activity of non-activated PRP against the three tested bacterial species. Furthermore, the activation of PRP led to the formation of a gel that precipitated at the bottom of the wells of microtiter plates. Therefore, the bacteriostatic activity of activated PRPs could not be evaluated via the broth microdilution method. Hence, the bactericidal activity of the activated PRPs was evaluated by plating the tested mixtures onto TSA plates and counting the colonies. However, no bactericidal effect was detected.\nContrary to the findings of Attili et al., which indicated a decrease in the bacterial load of P. aeruginosa due to PRP, Edelblute et al. found no antibacterial efficacy of PRP against P. aeruginosa; however, notable bactericidal activity was detected against 40% of their S. aureus isolates using the broth microdilution technique33,47. This may be due to the fact that none of the S. aureus strains examined in their investigation were MRSA. Drago et al. indicated that PRP exhibited no efficacy against P. aeruginosa; however, it did provide growth suppression against other bacteria, including Candida albicans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus oralis, and Enterococcus faecalis11.\nMost P. aeruginosa strains produce one or more extracellular pigments, including pyoverdine (yellow\u2013green), pyocyanin (blue\u2013green), pyomelanin (brown\u2013black), and pyorubrin (red\u2013brown). In our study, wells containing suspensions of P. aeruginosa incubated with PRP presented yellow\u2013green pigmentation compared with the dark\u2013green pigmentation of those without PRP. These findings indicate that PRP led to the production of pyoverdine at the expense of pyocyanin. According to Abdelaziz et al., the synthesis of extracellular pigments is affected by the composition of incubation media, such as nitrogen and carbon sources. Hence, the production of pyoverdine in the present study might be attributed to the presence of organic nitrogen sources in PRP48.\nAnother trial was performed via checkerboard synergy testing to demonstrate the effect of PRP in combination with antibiotics. This method also had indifferent effects on most of the tested isolates (58.49%). Although still non bacteriostatic, it had a synergistic effect on only 12.50% of the MRSA isolates when combined with cefoxitin and on 37.50% of the P. aeruginosa isolates when combined with ceftazidime. However, it showed antagonistic activity against 26.42% of the tested isolates. No further studies that used checkerboard synergy testing of PRP with antibiotics were found in the literature. However, Cetinkaya et al. demonstrated that PRP exhibited a synergistic effect on MRSA when used in conjunction with vancomycin in a rat model of surgical wound infection49.\nThe last trial was performed via a time-kill assay. Finally, this method showed a highly statistically significant antimicrobial effect of PRG (activated PRP) against the three tested MDR strains compared with the controls after 1, 2, and 5\u00a0h of incubation. The peak point of effectiveness differed according to the studied microorganism. The efficiency of the PPR decreased after the second hour of incubation for MRSA and MDR P. aeruginosa, and after the first hour for MDR K. pneumoniae. PRP had a peak effectiveness of about 99.50%, 91.35%, and 97.23% against the growth rates of MRSA, MDR K. pneumoniae, and MDR P. aeruginosa, respectively. PRP\u2019s antimicrobial impact lasted up to 5\u00a0h. When all of the tested strains were examined after 24\u00a0h of incubation, they all demonstrated regrowth and the elimination of the inhibitory effect of PRP, as compared to the controls. Cetinkaya et al. also discovered that PRP had antimicrobial effects on MRSA, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa; however, the effects were statistically significant only on MRSA and P. aeruginosa, and only in the first hour of their study, which is consistent with the findings of the current study45. Moojen et al. found similar findings, stating that PRP had a strong antibacterial impact that was limited to the first hour after application and could maintain a proportional reduction in bacteria of roughly 99% compared to the control for up to 8\u00a0h50. According to Hasan et al., the maximal antibacterial activity of PRP against S. aureus was limited to the first hour after application, and the antimicrobial effect peaked at 4\u00a0h with an 84.2% reduction in bacterial count. This rate dropped to 76.3% after 24\u00a0h17.\nCompared with planktonic bacteria, bacterial biofilms are known to exhibit significantly greater resistance to antimicrobial agents. Therefore, they demand substantially higher concentrations of antimicrobial factors to exert any effect. This heightened resistance is due to the ability of biofilm-producing bacteria to shield themselves within the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). Antimicrobial agents released by substances find it challenging to penetrate biofilm cultures because of their diffusion-limited transport through biofilm EPS. As these agents pass through, they become diluted, making it difficult for them to reach bacterial colonies51,52.\nIn our study, 69.81% of the studied isolates were biofilm producers, and PRP had no effect on biofilm formation or established biofilms. Similar findings were reported by Smith et al.53. In contrast, Gilbertie et al. found that PPR and amikacin had synergistic efficacy against aminoglycoside-tolerant biofilm formations, with stronger activity against gram-positive bacteria54. This could be due to a specific \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d when a treatment can effectively target biofilms, occurring between the initial adhesion and irreversible binding of bacteria. During this phase, bacteria are vulnerable, but once a biofilm is formed, it becomes resistant to penetration. Consequently, topical PRP application appears ineffective against well-established biofilms. In clinical settings, PRP might be more effective when combined with antibiotic therapy against these firmly established colonies55.\nIn vivo experiments yielded better findings for PRP\u2019s antibacterial action than in vitro investigations. Sun et al. successfully eliminated the infection and achieved wound closure using autologous PG and negative pressure wound therapy in a case involving a diabetic patient and an infected amputation caused by MDR Acinetobacter baumannii that remained unresolved despite extended antibiotic treatments56. In a rabbit model of implant-associated spinal infection, Li et al. found that PRP treatment significantly reduced bacterial colonies in bone samples and improved bone healing post-operatively57. However, our study indicated that the bacterial inhibition observed, when present, was temporary, suggesting a possible depletion of plasma antibacterial factors. This could be attributed to bacteria being less susceptible to direct topical application of PRP without an immune response providing additional antimicrobial support. These findings have practical implications for the clinical use of blood-derived biomaterials. Particularly noteworthy is the potential exploration of whether regular PRP application to wounds could mitigate the risk of bacterial regrowth and infections. As a result, more rigorous clinical evidence is required to justify the use of PRP in DFIs. Future large-scale prospective randomized controlled clinical trials should be conducted to develop uniform guidelines for the indications, contraindications, and particular methods for PRP use in clinical settings.\nIn conclusion, only activated PRP effectively inhibited microbial growth, indicating that coagulation activation is a crucial step. Bacterial growth inhibition by PRP was apparent immediately after activation; however, it was temporary and persisted for up to 5\u00a0h, varying by bacterial strain, indicating differential susceptibility to or consumption of the antibacterial factors present in the PRP suspension. Consequently, PRP can function synergistically with antibiotics and serve as an additional therapy for infections. Variations in study designs, including PRP preparation, platelet activation, bacterial kind, and the antibiotic resistance profile of bacteria, may account for the disparate results. Nevertheless, the majority of in vitro and in vivo investigations have demonstrated that there are no contraindications for the application of PRP in infected wounds.\n\n## Methods\nAn in vitro experimental study was conducted from April 2021 to May 2022 at the HIPH and the Clinical Pathology Laboratory at AMUH. The study proposal was approved by the Ethics Committee at the HIPH, Alexandria University, Egypt. Informed consent was obrained from each participant in this study. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations for ethics approval and consent to participate.\nTo collect the isolates required for the study, a total of 78 swab samples were randomly collected from clinically suspected infected DF lesions of patients admitted to the Vascular Surgery and Diabetic Foot Unit at the Surgery Department in AMUH (Fig.\u00a06). Bacterial isolates other than MRSA, MDR K. pneumoniae, and MDR P. aeruginosa were excluded from the PRP experimental study.\n\n## Sampling and processing of samples\nNo antimicrobial agent or antiseptic agent was introduced into diabetic foot wounds before samples were collected. Swab samples were collected via Levine\u2019s technique58. The swabs were then replaced into their containers and transported directly without refrigeration to the Microbiology Laboratory at the HIPH.\nFig. 6Diabetic foot ulcer.\nThe collected swabs were inoculated onto blood agar and MacConkey agar plates. The plates were incubated in aerobic conditions at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24 to 48\u00a0h. All isolated colonies on the blood and MacConkey agar plates were identified following conventional microbiological procedures59. All isolates of S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method on MHA plates60. Isolates of S. aureus exhibiting resistance to cefoxitin (30\u00a0\u00b5g) were classified as MRSA61. K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa isolates exhibiting resistance to at least one agent across three or more antibiotic classes were classified as MDR62.\nAll MDR K. pneumoniae isolates were tested for ESBL production, and bacterial suspensions were prepared via the direct colony suspension method. The bacterial suspensions were subsequently inoculated onto MHA plates. Subsequently, cefotaxime and ceftazidime discs, both individually and in combination with clavulanate (cefotaxime-clavulanate 30/10 \u00b5g and ceftazidime-clavulanate 30/10 \u00b5g), were placed on each plate, which were then incubated at 35\u201337\u00a0\u00b0C for a duration of 16\u201318\u00a0h. Positive ESBL production was noted when a\u2009>\u20095\u00a0mm increase in the zone diameter occurred for either antimicrobial agent tested when combined with clavulanate compared to the zone diameter of the agent tested individually (Figs.\u00a07 and 8)61.\nAll MDR P. aeruginosa isolates were evaluated for carbapenemase production using the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM), as per the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (Fig.\u00a09)61.\nFig. 7ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolate on MHA: a\u2009\u2265\u20095\u00a0mm increase in the zone diameter was observed for either antimicrobial agent tested in combination with clavulanate versus the zone diameter of the agent when tested alone.\nFig. 8Non-ESBL-producing K. pneumon",
