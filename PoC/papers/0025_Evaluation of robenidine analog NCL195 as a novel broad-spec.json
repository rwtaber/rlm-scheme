Recent approaches towards combating antimicrobial resistance include repurposing old compounds with known safety and development pathways as new antibacterial classes with novel mechanisms of action. Here we show that an analog of the anticoccidial drug robenidine (4,6-bis(2-((E)-4-methylbenzylidene)hydrazinyl)pyrimidin-2-amine; NCL195) displays potent bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus by disrupting the cell membrane potential.

NCL195 was bactericidal against Acinetobacter spp and Neisseria meningitidis and also demonstrated potent activity against A. baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and polymyxin B. These findings demonstrate that NCL195 represents a new chemical lead for further medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical development to enhance potency, solubility and selectivity against serious bacterial pathogens.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nInfectious diseases particularly lower respiratory infections caused by bacterial and viral pathogens are the third leading cause of death [1] and the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years, worldwide [2]. Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) and Staphylococcus aureus (\u2018golden staph\u2019) are two such bacterial pathogens. The pneumococcus accounts for an estimated one million deaths annually in developing countries, and causes a broad spectrum of diseases including pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia and otitis media (OM), particularly in children under five years of age, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals [3]. Although the current capsular-based pneumococcal vaccines have been effective in preventing pneumococcal sepsis and meningitis in developed countries, the vaccines induce strictly serotype-specific protection against a limited subset of pneumococcal types and furthermore are generally not affordable in developing countries. In addition, there is evident replacement of carriage and disease burden by non-vaccine serotypes following immunization [4, 5]. In developed countries, where effective antimicrobial therapy is readily accessible, deaths from pneumococcal disease occur primarily among people over 60 years of age, with case fatality rates of 10\u201320% for pneumonia and up to 40% for bacteremia [3]. In contrast, S. aureus is the second most clinically important antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogen in developed countries behind E. coli, and a major public health concern due to the increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in hospitals, among hospital workers and within the community [6\u20139]. Median direct medical costs associated with MRSA sepsis have been estimated at $12,078 US per patient and are approximately1.3 times higher than costs associated with susceptible S. aureus infection [10].\nEffective treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections remains hampered by the alarming increase in prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as well as accelerated global spread of bacterial clones resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents [11, 12]. For pneumococcal disease, the problem is compounded by the highly transformable nature of this organism, enhancing genetic exchanges through horizontal gene transfer [13]. Moreover, pneumococcal OM accounts for more antibiotic prescriptions than any other infection [14, 15], driving selection for resistance amongst diverse bacteria, significantly affecting health-care costs in developed countries [$2.88 billion p.a. for USA] [16]. Recently, novel antimicrobials such as third-generation fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin) and cyclic lipopeptides (e.g. daptomycin) have been shown to be effective against S. pneumoniae in vitro and in mouse models of infection [17\u201319]. However, there are reports of increasing frequency of S. pneumoniae resistance to the fluoroquinolones [20]. For MRSA, resistance or reduced susceptibility to multiple agents including vancomycin and daptomycin, is frequently reported in hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) [21]. Although community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) are generally susceptible to most drug classes over time they have acquired additional antimicrobial resistance genes. Furthermore, CA-MRSA are generally more virulent with higher mortality rates compared to HA-MRSA [22, 23]. Certain MRSA clones have recently become host-adapted in animals, furthering the spread of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) within the environment [24]. In some countries, up to 54% of K. pneumoniae cases have been reported as carbapenem-resistant, the current last resort treatment for severe Gram-negative infections [25, 26]. Adding to this dire situation, the transferable colistin resistance determinant (MCR-1) is now widely distributed amongst both animal and human Gram-negative pathogens and commensals, resulting in some Gram-negative pathogens developing pan-resistance to all registered compounds [27, 28]. Therefore, the discovery and development of new broad-spectrum antimicrobials with activity against pan-resistant Enterobacteriaceae causing sepsis is one of the highest global priorities [29\u201331].\nIn 2010, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has called for 10 new antimicrobial agents to be registered by 2020 [32]. Since that call, all new registered agents except one (fidaxomicin) have been developed from existing drug classes, against Gram-positive organisms (telavancin, dalbavancin, tedizolid, oritavancin) or Gram-negative organisms (ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam) [33\u201336]. Robenidine (2,2'-bis[(4-chlorophenyl)methylene] carbonimidic dihydrazide hydrochloride) is an anticoccidial agent which has been used worldwide since the early 1970s to prevent coccidian infections of poultry and rabbits [37]. However, there have been no in-depth in vivo evaluations of this compound or its chemical class as potential antibacterial agents. This presents an attractive prospect for testing the antibacterial activity of robenidine, an agent with known safety and long history of oral use in avian species and an oral LD50 of 150 mg/kg in mice [38], by expanding its chemical space with further medicinal chemistry for potential development as a parenteral or topically administered drug [39\u201341].\n\n## Antimicrobial agents and medicinal chemistry\nAnalytical grade aminoguanidine robenidine (NCL812) [42] and two of its analogs (NCL195 and NCL219) were synthesized in house at The University of Newcastle and stored in a sealed sample container out of direct light at 4\u00b0C at the study site at the Infectious Diseases Laboratory, Roseworthy campus, The University of Adelaide. Ampicillin (\u03b2-lactam broad-spectrum antibiotic) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Australia), while daptomycin (in pharmaceutically active form) was purchased from Cubist. Stock solutions (containing 25.6 mg/ml of each compound in DMSO) were prepared and stored in 1 ml aliquots at -80\u00b0C and defrosted immediately prior to use. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Disodium salt, CAS Number: 6381-92-6) was purchased from Chem-Supply Pty Ltd, South Australia and was dissolved in water to 200 mM. Polymyxin B sulfate (CAS Number: 1405-20-5) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n## Synthesis of NCL195 (4,6-bis(2-((E)-4-methylbenzylidene)hydrazinyl)pyrimidin-2-amine)\nA suspension of 2-amino-4,6-dihydrazinopyrimidine (58.9 mg, 0.380 mmol) and 4-methylbenzaldehyde (0.10 ml, 100 mg, 0.832 mmol, 2.19 eq.) in EtOH (4 ml) was heated at reflux for 16 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature before collecting the pellet-like precipitate, washing with diethyl ether (20 ml). The \u2018pellets\u2019 were then crushed and the solid further washed with diethyl ether (10 ml) to afford the pyrimidine (85.8 mg, 63%) as a white \u2018fluffy\u2019 powder. 1H NMR ((CD3)2SO, 400 MHz) \u03b4 10.51 (s, 2H), 8.00 (s, 2H), 7.54 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 4H), .26 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, 4H), 6.27 (s, 1H), 5.78 (s, 2H), 2.34 (s,6H); 13C NMR ((CD3)2SO, 101 MHz) \u03b4 162.8 (2C), 162.6 (2C), 140.1 (2C), 138.4 (2C), 132.5 (2C), 129.4 (4C), 126.0 (4C), 73.3, 21.0 (6C).\n\nA suspension of N,N-diaminoguanidine hydrochloride (47.7 mg, 0.380 mmol) and 4\u2032-(tert-butyl)acetophenone (134 mg, 0.760 mmol, 2 eq.) and in EtOH was heated at reflux for 16 h. The mixture was cooled and diluted with Et2O to effect crystallization. The resulting precipitate was collected and washed with Et2O 920 ml) to afford the carbonimidic dihydrazide (134 mg, 84%) as a yellow crystalline solid. 1H NMR ((CD3)2SO, 400 MHz) \u03b4 11.74 (s, 1H), 8.60 (s, 1H), 7.95 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H), 7.45 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H), 2.42 (s, 3H), 1.31 (s, 9H). 13C NMR ((CD3)2SO, 101 MHz) \u03b4 154.1, 153.3, 152.6, 134.0, 126.8, 125.0, 34.5, 30.9, 14.9.\n\n## Bacterial strains and growth conditions\nThe S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and VRE isolates used in this study are listed in S1, S2 and S3 Tables in Supporting information. Isolates were cultured on Horse Blood Agar (HBA) plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C, for 18 h. The pneumococci isolates were incubated in 5% CO2. The NCL812, NCL195 and NCL219 minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was performed on all isolates.\nPneumococcal serotype-specific capsule production was confirmed on all pneumococcal isolates by the Quellung reaction [43]. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), kill kinetics, TEM and efficacy testing experiments was performed on S. pneumoniae D39 (NCTC7466), a well-documented laboratory strain with well-defined and predictable in vitro characteristics and in vivo pathogenicity profiles [44, 45]. MBCs, kill kinetics and point of resistance assays were performed on S. aureus Xen29 (luminescent ATCC 12600 S. aureus strain).\n\n## MIC determination\nMICs for NCL812 and its analogs (serial two-fold dilutions commencing at 128 \u03bcg/ml) were determined (in duplicate) in round bottom 96-well microtitre trays (Sarstedt 82.1582.001), using the broth micro-dilution method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [46]. Luria Bertani (LB) broth (Oxoid, Australia) [supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood and 5% horse serum for S pneumoniae experiments] was used instead of cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (CAMHB) as it was shown previously that NCL812 can chelate calcium ions [47]. In addition, serial two-fold dilutions of the NCL compounds were performed in 100% DMSO, with 1 \u03bcl added to each well, as the compounds are hydrophobic [42]. The MIC for ampicillin or daptomycin against each S. pneumoniae, S. aureus or VRE isolate was determined for each test run as an internal quality control. MIC50, MIC90 and MIC range for NCL812, NCL195 and NCL219 were calculated against each S. pneumoniae, S. aureus or VRE isolate. To assess the potential activity of NCL195 against Gram-negative bacteria, MICs against Acinetobacter spp, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp and Neisseria meningitidis were performed in the presence or absence of 0.08 mM-20 mM EDTA in a standard checkerboard assay [48].\n\n## Kill kinetics\nKill kinetic assays on S. pneumoniae D39 were performed (in duplicate) essentially as described for MIC determination, with the exception that the starting concentration of each NCL compound was 64 \u03bcg/ml, and the assay was performed using 200 \u03bcl volumes in a round bottom 96-well microtitre tray (Sarstedt 82.1582.001). The tray was covered with Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Z380059, Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 16 h overnight at 35\u00b0C in an EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader 2300 (PerkinElmer), with data collected every 20 min and 2 sec agitation at 60 rpm between data (A600 nm) acquisitions. The experiment was repeated using the luminescent D39LUX strain on a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) using IsoplateTM-96 F tray PerkinElmer, 6005020). Kill kinetic assays on S. aureus Xen29 was carried out essentially as described for MIC determination on Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader.\n\n## Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) determination\nIn order to determine the MBC of each compound against S. pneumoniae D39 or S. aureus Xen29, 10 \u03bcl aliquots from each duplicate well from the MIC assays (starting from the MIC for each compound) was inoculated onto a HBA plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C (+ 5% CO2 for S. pneumoniae D39). Plates were examined at 24 and 48 h and the MBC was recorded as the lowest concentration of each test compound at which a 99.9% colony count reduction was observed on the plate [46].\n\n## Time-dependent killing assays\nTime kill assays were performed (in duplicate) essentially as described previously [42, 49] with slight modifications. Briefly, a few colonies of luminescent S. pneumoniae strain D39LUX or luminescent S. aureus ATCC 12600 (Xen29) from an overnight HBA were emulsified in normal saline and adjusted to A600 nm = 0.10 (equivalent to approx. 5 \u00d7 107 c.f.u. per ml) and the bacterial suspension further diluted 1:20 in saline. NCL195 was prepared in 10 ml volumes at 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 MIC (using 4\u00d7 MIC of ampicillin and normal saline as controls) in either LB broth (for Xen29) or LB supplemented with 3% lysed horse blood and 5% horse serum (for D39). The compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO at 100\u00d7 the final desired concentration and 100 \u03bcl of appropriate concentrations added to each 10 ml preparation. Duplicate cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C (+ 5% CO2 for S. pneumoniae D39), with samples withdrawn at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h, serially diluted 10-fold and plated on HBA overnight at 37\u00b0C (+ 5% CO2 for S. pneumoniae D39) for bacterial enumeration.\n\n## Point of resistance assay\nTo determine if S. aureus develops resistance to the NCL195, we performed 24 daily sequential culturing of S. aureus Xen29 in 2 ml LB broth the presence of 0.5\u00d7MIC, 0.75\u00d7MIC, 1\u00d7MIC, 1.5\u00d7MIC, 2\u00d7MIC, and 4\u00d7MIC of NCL195, using 1\u00d7MIC, 4\u00d7MIC and 8\u00d7MIC of daptomycin as control (in triplicates), essentially as described by Ling et al.[50]. After the 24th passage, samples were centrifuged at 4,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and washed in 50 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice to remove any residual antimicrobial, and/or bacterial end products and media. Washed bacteria were resuspended in PBS to A600 nm = 0.1 and MICs were performed as described above.\n\n## Effect of NCL812 on \nMorphological appearance and morphometric analysis of the cell membrane of S. pneumoniae D39 after exposure to either 1 \u03bcg/ml, 4 \u03bcg/ml or 16 \u03bcg/ml of NCL812 was determined using TEM, as described in S1 File (Supplementary Methods). For S. aureus ATCC 29213, macromolecular (DNA, RNA, protein, cell wall, and lipid) synthesis inhibition studies were performed using concentrations of NCL812 that were equivalent to 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 8-fold the MIC value (4 \u03bcg/ml), as detailed in S1 File (Supplementary Methods).\n\n## Mechanism of action studies\nTo further examine the mechanism underlying the perturbation of the cell membrane of S. pneumoniae or S. aureus by the NCL compounds, the membrane potential of the cells was measured by fluorescence spectrometry using (DiOC2(3), essentially as described previously[51, 52]. Briefly, D39 cells from an overnight HBA plate were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 1% yeast extract (THY) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 until A600 nm = 0.5. The cells were centrifuged at 4,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at room temperature, washed twice in one culture volume of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended in the same buffer to A600 nm = 10. For the fluorescence assay, 0.2 ml of this suspension was added to 1.8 ml of the same buffer in a quartz cuvette, the mixture was stirred gently for 5 min (with or without addition of 16 \u03bcg/ml of test compounds, using 16 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin as control). This concentration corresponds to 2\u00d7MIC of NCL812 and NCL195, and 4\u00d7MIC of NCL219 for S. pneumoniae. The cuvette was then placed in a LS 55 Fluorescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer) set at Ex. 488 nm/Em. 620 nm, with excitation and emission slit widths at 5 nm and 7 nm, respectively). The background fluorescence of each suspension was followed for 1 min after which DiOC2(3) was added to a final concentration of 10 \u03bcM and the fluorescence monitored until it plateaued. Cells were then re-energized with 0.5% glucose and fluorescence further monitored until it plateaued, after which 10 \u03bcM of the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was added and fluorescence followed again until plateaued. A similar procedure was followed using S. aureus cells resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to A600 nm = 5, using 16 \u03bcg/ml of test compounds, corresponding to 4\u00d7MIC of NCL812, 8\u00d7MIC NCL195, and 1\u00d7MIC of NCL219 for S. aureus. All assays were performed at least twice.\n\n## Microsomal stability of NCL812, NCL195 and NCL219\nThe metabolic stability assay was performed by incubating 0.4 \u03bcg/ml of each test compound with human and mouse liver microsomes (Xenotech, Lot# 1210057 and 1310211, respectively) suspended in 0.1 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer at 37\u00b0C and 0.4 mg/ml protein concentration. The metabolic reaction was initiated by the addition of an NADPH-regenerating system (i.e. NADPH is the cofactor required for CYP450-mediated metabolism) and quenched at various time points over a 60 min incubation period by the addition of acetonitrile containing diazepam as internal standard. Control samples (containing no NADPH) were included (and quenched at 2, 30 and 60 min) to monitor for potential degradation in the absence of cofactor. Test compound concentration vs time data were fitted to an exponential decay function to determine the first-order rate constant for substrate depletion. This was used to calculate a degradation half-life (T1/2), in vitro intrinsic clearance (CLINT), microsome-predicted blood clearance (CLblood) and a microsome-predicted hepatic extraction ratio (EH) according to the in vitro half-life method of Obach[53].\n\n## Ethics statements\nFor determination of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for NCL812 and NCL195 in mice following systemic exposure, 5-9-week-old male outbred Swiss mice, weighing 21 to 32 g, obtained from Monash Animal Research Platform (MARP), were used. Mice had access to food and water ad libitum throughout the pre- and post-dose sampling period. The Animal Ethics Committee of the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences reviewed and approved all animal PK experiments (approval number MIPS.2013.33). The PK studies were conducted in compliance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (7th Edition 2004).\n\n## Determination of PK parameters for NCL812 and NCL195 after systemic exposure\nPlasma concentration vs time profiles were determined for NCL812 and NCL195 after intravenous (IV) administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and for NCL195 after IP administration at a dose of 43 mg/kg. For the IV exposure, each compound was administered via a bolus injection into the tail vein (vehicle 20% (v/v) DMSO in PEG400, 1 ml/kg dose volume, n = 8 mice per compound, resulting in average measured concentration of 5.25 and 4.31 mg/ml for NCL812 and NCL195, respectively). The compounds were administered to mice within 2.5 h of preparation. Following administration, blood samples were collected at 5, 15, 30, 120, 240 and 480 min post- dose (n = 2 mice per time point for each compound). For IP administration of NCL195, the formulation was prepared by dissolving solid NCL195 in DMSO (to 20% (v/v) of the final volume) before addition of PEG400, yielding a clear yellow solution that was dosed to mice within 30 min of preparation. The measured concentration of NCL195 in the final formulation was 21.9 mg/ml, resulting in a mean administered dose of 43 mg/kg, and blood samples were collected up to 24 h post-dose.\nFor both the IV and IP administration, a maximum of two samples were obtained from each mouse, with samples being taken either via submandibular bleed (approximately 120 \u03bcl; conscious sampling) or terminal cardiac puncture (0.6 ml; under inhaled Isoflurane anesthesia). No urine samples were collected as mice were housed in bedded cages during the study. In all experiments, mice were observed continuously for the first hour after dosing, then hourly until up to 6\u20138 hours after dosing. All animals showed normal behaviour (including grooming, eating, drinking, sleeping, alertness) over the post-dose period. Mice were humanely sacrificed by cervical dislocation while under anaesthesia (using gaseous isoflurane) at the end of experiments. Blood was collected directly into polypropylene Eppendorf tubes containing heparin as anti-coagulant, and stabilization cocktail (containing Complete (a protease inhibitor cocktail with EDTA) and potassium fluoride) to minimize the potential for ex vivo degradation of the test compounds in blood/plasma samples. Once collected, blood samples were centrifuged immediately, supernatant plasma was removed, and stored at either -80\u00b0C (for the IV exposure) or at -20\u00b0C (for the IP exposure) until analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Following protein precipitation with acetonitrile, thawed plasma samples were analyzed by LC-MS (Waters Micromass Quattro Premier coupled to a Waters Acquity UPLC) using positive electrospray ionization operating in MRM mode. PK parameters (apparent half-life, plasma clearance, volume of distribution and area-under-the curve (AUC)) were determined for NCL812 and NCL195 after IV administration using non-compartmental methods (WinNonlin Version 6.3.0.395).\n\n## Haemolysis assay\nThis was performed using fresh donor human red blood cells (RBCs), essentially as described previously [50]. Fresh RBCs were washed in PBS three times at 500 \u00d7 g for 5 min, and then resuspended 1% (w/v) in PBS. Two microliters of serial 2-fold dilutions of each compound was added into the respective wells, in quadruplicates, in a round bottom 96-well microtitre tray (Sarstedt 82.1582.001), starting at 128 \u03bcg/ml for each compound using ampicillin as a control. Thereafter, 198 \u03bcL of the 1% RBC solution was added into each well, and the mixture incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, with shaking at 100 rpm. Quadruplicate wells containing either 1% Triton X100, or PBS only, served as controls. After incubation, the trays were centrifuged at 1,000 \u00d7 g for 3 min and 100 \u03bcl of supernatant from each well transferred into a new 96-well tray. Absorbance was measured at A450 nm on a Multiskan Ascent 354 Spectrophotometer (Labsystems) and plotted against each dilution. Haemolytic titer was determined as the reciprocal of the dilution at which 50% of erythrocytes were lysed at A450 nm. The experiment was performed twice.\n\nIn order to ensure minimal off target mammalian cell cytotoxicity, we assayed NCL812, NCL195 and NCL219 for in vitro cytotoxicity using a panel of adherent mammalian cell lines: Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line), HEL 299 (non-cancerous human lung fibroblast cell line), Hep G2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line), MDBK (normal bovine kidney cell line) and MCF7 (human mammary gland adenocarcinoma cell line). Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Gibco Cat No: 12430) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 1% PenStrep (100 U/ml Penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml Streptomycin) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and passaged ~ every 3 days. Assays were performed in duplicates in flat bottom 96 well tissue culture trays (Sarstedt 83.3924) seeded with either ~2.5 \u00d7 104 cells or 5 \u00d7 104 cells per well. After 24 h incubation, media was removed, washed once with medium without antibiotics and fresh medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS was added. After 2 h, the NCL compounds were diluted in DMSO and added to each well at a concentration of 1% in doubling dilutions starting at the same concentrations used for MIC testing, using wells containing 1% DMSO only as control. Following exposure for 24 h, WST-1 reagent was added to each well at a final concentration of 10%. Absorbance at A450 nm on a Multiskan Ascent 354 Spectrophotometer (Labsystems) was recorded after 1 h of incubation. The IC50 value for each compound against each cell line was determined via non-linear regression (three parameters) using GraphPad Prism v6 software. The robustness of assays was confirmed with selected cell lines (Hep G2 and MDBK) seeded onto a 96\u2013well Microwell Nunclon Delta Surface plate (Thermo Scientific Nunc; Cat No: 136101) at 5 \u00d7 104 cells per well. Viability of each cell line in the presence of 2 or 8 \u03bcg/ml of each compound was assessed at 1 h intervals for 20 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 on a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) using the RealTime-Glo MT Cell Viability Assay reagent (Promega). Viability of each cell line in the presence of 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mM EDTA was also assessed using the same reagent.\n\n## Results\nIn this study, building on our previous exploration of the key structure activity relationship of early stage robenidine (NCL812) analogs against S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.,[42] we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of two new analogs in comparison to the parent NCL812 as potential antibacterial agents for both S. pneumoniae and S. aureus infection. We developed a series of analogs through condensation of a range of aldehydes and phenones with diaminoguanidine hydrochloride [42]. Subsequent screening for antibacterial activity led to the identification of two contrasting analogs, NCL219 ((E)-N'-((E)-1-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)ethylidene)-2-(1-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)ethylidene)hydrazine-1-carboximidhydrazide) and NCL195 (4,6-bis(2-((E)-4-methylbenzylidene)hydrazinyl)pyrimidin-2-amine) with the latter resulting from installation of a 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine as a guanidyl moiety bioisostere (Fig 1).\n\n## NCL compounds are bactericidal against \nTo examine the antimicrobial activities of NCL195, NCL219 and NCL812, we carried out MIC and MBC testing of the three compounds against 21 S. pneumoniae isolates representing a broad range of serotypes, and 23 clinical S. aureus isolates of diverse multilocus sequence types. MIC testing of the three compounds was also carried out on 20 vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) isolates, using Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 as a control strain. For S. pneumoniae, the MIC range for NCL812 and NCL195 were the same (2\u20138 \u03bcg/ml), while the MIC range for NCL219 was 1\u20138 \u03bcg/ml (Table 1). In the presence of 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), the MIC range for the three compounds remained the same (S1 Table). For S. aureus, the MIC range was 2\u20138 \u03bcg/ml for NCL812 (consistent with previous observation with NCL812 [42]; 1\u20132 \u03bcg/ml for NCL195; and 8 - >64 \u03bcg/ml for NCL219 (Table 1). However, in the presence of 10% FBS, the MIC range increased 4-8-fold to 32 \u03bcg/ml for NCL812 (again consistent with previous observation with NCL812 [42]; the MIC range increased 4-fold to 4\u20138 \u03bcg/ml for NCL195, while the MIC range remained essentially the same at 4->64 \u03bcg/ml for NCL219 (S2 Table). For the VRE isolates, the MIC range for NCL812 and NCL195 were the same (2\u20134 \u03bcg/ml), while the MIC range for NCL219 was 1\u20132 \u03bcg/ml. (Table 1). In the presence of 10% FBS, the MIC range increased 8-16-fold to 32 \u03bcg/ml for NCL812, the MIC range increased 4-fold to 16\u201332 \u03bcg/ml for NCL195, while the MIC range increased 8-fold to 8\u201316 \u03bcg/ml for NCL219 (S3 Table). When the MIC determination for NCL195 against S. pneumoniae D39 and S. aureus 49775 was carried out in the presence of human, horse or mouse serum, the MIC remained the same against D39, but a 4-fold increase in MIC was observed against S. aureus 49775, again as seen previously with NCL812 [42].\n\n## NCL195 kills \nWe next performed a kill kinetic assay for NCL812, NCL195 and NCL219 against S. pneumoniae D39 in a micro-dilution series, with a starting concentration at 64 \u03bcg/ml. Our results show that the MBC for the three compounds against S. pneumoniae D39 was 8, 8 and 4 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (equivalent to their respective MIC90), confirming that the three compounds are bactericidal against S. pneumoniae. Similar MIC and MBC results were obtained using S. pneumoniae D39. For S. aureus Xen29, the MBC for NCL812, NCL195 and NCL219 was 4, 2 and 16 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, confirming their bactericidal activity against another clinically-relevant Gram-positive pathogen. Finally, we interrogated the time-kill profile of NCL195 against either S. pneumoniae D39 or S. aureus Xen29, using 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 MIC of NCL195, with 4\u00d7 MIC of ampicillin (or 4\u00d7 MIC of daptomycin) and normal saline serving as controls. We found that it took 6 h to reduce the test population of D39 below the limit of detection at 2\u00d7 MIC of NCL195; the time-to-clear was reduced to 4 h using 4\u00d7 MIC of NCL195. Ampicillin at 4\u00d7 MIC required 8 h to effect clearance of D39 bacteria below the limit of detection (Fig 2A). For S. aureus Xen29, it took 6 h to clear all Xen29 at 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 MIC of NCL195, and at 4\u00d7 MIC of ampicillin (Fig 2B), while it took only 1 h to clear all Xen29 at 4\u00d7 MIC of daptomycin (Fig 2C). After 24 h, some S. aureus regrowth was observed for NCL195 and ampicillin at the concentrations tested. We confirmed that the rebound growth was neither due to chemical instability of NCL195 or emergence of a resistant population by adding 105 or 103 c.f.u. of S. aureus Xen29 in LB broth containing 1\u00d7MIC, 2\u00d7MIC and 4\u00d7MIC of NCL195 over 24\u201372 h, using daptomycin at either 1\u00d7MIC or 4\u00d7MIC as control. In this assay, no regrowth was observed in any of the samples upon plating on antibiotic-free plates after 24 h. However, after 72 h incubation in the presence of antibiotic, a few colonies were obtained from broth containing 105 c.f.u. of Xen29 to which 1\u00d7MIC, 2\u00d7MIC and 4\u00d7MIC of NCL195 was added. We subjected the colonies that grew after 72 h to MIC testing and these returned 1\u00d7 MIC for NCL195.\nWe then explored the possibility of antimicrobial resistance to NLC195 by performing 24 daily sequential cultures of S. aureus in the presence of 0.5\u00d7MIC, 0.75\u00d7MIC, 1\u00d7MIC, 1.5\u00d7MIC, 2\u00d7MIC, and 4\u00d7MIC of NCL195, using 1\u00d7MIC, 4\u00d7MIC and 8\u00d7MIC of daptomycin as control. We could not find any resistant mutant above 1\u00d7 MIC for NCL195 over the 24 passages, although resistance to daptomycin increased up to 8\u00d7MIC by day 12 of the serial passage (Fig 2D). This was confirmed by MIC testing of the bacteria that grew at the respective MICs.\n\n## NCL195 is bactericidal against Gram-negative bacteria\nOur recent studies whereby NCL812 was co-administered with a sub-inhibitory concentration of polymyxin B nonapeptide (a compound known to disrupt the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria but with negligible antimicrobial activity) demonstrated Gram-negative activity comparable with clofazimine [42]. We also explored the potential activity of NCL195 against Gram-negative bacteria in the presence or absence of EDTA or polymyxin B, agents also known to disrupt the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria [54]. Interestingly, NCL195 in the absence of EDTA wa",
