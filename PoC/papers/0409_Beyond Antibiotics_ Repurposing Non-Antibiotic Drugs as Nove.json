According to the World Health Organization, AMR is projected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050, surpassing cancer as a leading cause of mortality, with an estimated economic burden exceeding USD 100 trillion globally [1]. Despite the development of new antibiotic classes, the rapid emergence of resistant bacterial strains continues to outpace the current drug development pipeline [2].\nTraditional antibiotic discovery is increasingly hindered by high costs, lengthy development timelines of 10\u201315 years, and high failure rates in clinical trials, necessitating alternative approaches to address this looming crisis [3]. In this context, drug repurposing has emerged as a promising strategy to identify new therapeutic uses for existing drugs that are already approved for human use, thereby bypassing many stages of the conventional drug development process, including toxicity and pharmacokinetic evaluation [3,4].\nWhilst most drug repurposing research has focused on anticancer, antiviral, or neurodegenerative applications, emerging evidence indicates that several non-antibiotic drugs exhibit intrinsic antibacterial activity or can potentiate the activity of existing antibiotics [3,4]. These include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), statins, calcium channel blockers, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and antiparasitic agents, among others [4]. Their mechanisms of antibacterial action vary, ranging from inhibition of bacterial efflux pumps and disruption of cell membranes to interference with quorum sensing and biofilm formation [3,4]. Recent advances in computational drug screening and artificial intelligence models have further facilitated the identification of non-antibiotic drugs with antibacterial activity, paving the way for systematic and rapid repurposing efforts [5,6].\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of non-antibiotic drugs with antibacterial potential, exploring their mechanisms of action, reported antibacterial activities, and possible synergistic effects with conventional antibiotics. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges, pharmacological considerations, and future directions for translating these findings into clinical practice as part of an effective strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance. By highlighting this underexplored therapeutic avenue, we aim to encourage further research into the rational repurposing of existing non-antibiotic drugs as standalone antibacterials or potentiators of antibiotic activity, ultimately contributing to the global fight against resistant bacterial infections.\n\n## 2.1. Efflux Pump Inhibition\nEfflux pumps are major contributors to multidrug resistance (MDR) in pathogenic bacteria, actively expelling a broad range of antibiotics from bacterial cells and thereby lowering intracellular drug concentrations and efficacy. Inhibition of these pumps is a promising antibacterial strategy to reverse resistance and restore antibiotic potency. Table 1 summarises evidence for efflux pump inhibition by non-antibiotic drugs, highlighting reductions in antibiotic MICs, but noting the frequent absence of formal FIC indices and mechanistic validation. Figure 1 highlights the possible antibacterial mechanisms of action of non-antibiotic drug classes.\n\n## 2.1.1. Phenothiazine Antipsychotics\nPhenothiazines such as thioridazine and chlorpromazine exhibit efflux pump inhibitory activity. Amaral and Viveiros (2017) reported that thioridazine inhibits efflux pumps in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, reversing resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin, and shows synergistic activity with first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs [7]. However, no specific minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values were provided in that study. Luna-Herrera et al. (2025) noted that thioridazine and chlorpromazine reduce clarithromycin and isoniazid MICs in M. tuberculosis via efflux pump inhibition, although they did not provide numeric MIC or FIC data [8]. Similarly, another investigation reported that phenothiazines enhance antibiotic efficacy via efflux pump inhibition, with no reported MIC data [9]. It was observed that thioridazine reduced ethambutol MIC for Mycobacterium avium from 8 \u00b5g/mL to 2 \u00b5g/mL, describing this as synergistic, though no formal FIC index was calculated [10]. One study reported that chlorpromazine reduced norfloxacin MIC from 4 \u00b5g/mL to 1 \u00b5g/mL in Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, interpreted as synergy due to efflux inhibition, but no checkerboard synergy assays were performed and \u01a9FIC values were not determined [11]. Phenothiazines have been described as synergistic in combination with penicillin against resistant bacteria, with MIC values reported as low as 2 \u00b5g/mL, although no FIC indices were provided [12]. Another investigation demonstrated that chlorpromazine reduces tetracycline MIC in Escherichia coli through AcrAB-TolC inhibition, but no numerical MIC or FIC data were provided [13]. It has also been shown that phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine exhibit synergistic interaction with erythromycin against Burkholderia pseudomallei, with synergy confirmed by FIC index \u2264 0.5 [14]. Overall, whilst synergy is frequently described, most studies lack formal checkerboard assays or defined FIC indices, and MIC reductions are often qualitative. Further work is required to determine whether these results do signify synergistic combinations, or if they show additive potentiation. Whatever the outcome, these studies highlight the potential benefit of these combination therapies for increasing antibiotic efficacy.\n\n## 2.1.2. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram have been studied for their bacterial efflux pump inhibition potential. Caldara and Marmiroli (2021) showed that sertraline was synergistic in combination with fluconazole against Candida albicans, with MIC90 reported as 3 \u00b5M. Additionally, FIC values were found to be below 0.5, indicating synergy [15]. However, the methods used to derive these FIC values were not detailed beyond stating checkerboard assays, limiting reproducibility and reliability in the author\u2019s interpretation [15]. Fluoxetine MICs against Gram-negative bacteria ranged from 15 to 126 \u00b5g/mL, although no FIC values or synergy testing methods were provided, limiting conclusions about direct efflux pump inhibition synergy [16]. Paroxetine showed an MIC of 64 \u00b5g/mL against S. aureus, enhancing aminoglycoside efficacy through efflux pump inhibition and membrane disruption. However, no FIC values were reported, and synergy was inferred from MIC reduction in the combination, rather than confirmed by checkerboard or time-kill assays [17]. For citalopram, Dong et al. (2024) [18] discussed its efflux pump inhibition potential leading to increased antibiotic susceptibility, although neither MIC nor FIC data were reported. Their conclusions were based on mechanistic pathway predictions rather than direct antimicrobial or synergy testing [18] and further studies are required to confirm the mechanism. Escitalopram demonstrated synergy with sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim, reducing MICs, although FIC indices were not provided. Synergy was inferred from MIC shifts alone, without formal checkerboard testing [19].\nOverall, although SSRIs show promising efflux pump inhibitory effects, MIC and FIC data are incompletely reported across studies. Where FIC indices were calculated, detailed methodology was often missing, and many studies inferred synergy only from MIC reductions. This limits reproducibility, mechanistic validation, and clinical translation. Therefore, future investigations must report exact MIC and FIC index values, define testing methods such as checkerboard or time-kill assays, and evaluate pharmacokinetic feasibility and toxicity to advance SSRIs as efflux pump inhibitors in clinical use.\n\n## 2.1.3. Calcium Channel Blockers\nRecent studies confirm that verapamil, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, has been widely investigated for its bacterial efflux pump inhibition potential. In studies screening S. aureus strains that express NorA efflux pumps, verapamil enhanced the activity of ciprofloxacin, although the precise MIC reductions and FIC values were not detailed in those studies [20]. Another study showed that verapamil reduced the MICs of antibiotics, including rifampicin against M. tuberculosis, with FIC indices ranging from 0.06 to 0.5, indicating strong synergy, although detailed MIC reduction values were not provided [21]. Conversely, Amaral et al. (2020) reported no significant synergy with isoniazid against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, with FIC indices \u2265 0.5 indicating additive or indifferent effects [22]. These studies primarily used checkerboard assays to derive synergy indices, but time-kill kinetic validation was rarely performed, limiting definitive conclusions about bactericidal synergy and potential clinical applicability.\nFurther detailed investigations demonstrated that against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, verapamil reduced the MIC of bedaquiline from 0.5 \u00b5M to 0.025 \u00b5M (20-fold reduction), with a reported FIC index of 0.06 [23]. Another study reported that verapamil combined with bedaquiline showed synergy against the multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strain R543 with an FIC index of 0.06, while its combination with clofazimine reduced the MIC four-fold (1.0 \u00b5M to 0.25 \u00b5M) with an FIC index of 0.19 [23].\nMechanistically, verapamil inhibits efflux pumps such as NorA in S. aureus, enhancing intracellular accumulation of fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, thereby reducing bacterial resistance [20]. The proposed mechanism involves direct pump interaction or membrane perturbation, although exact molecular binding remains undefined. Chen et al. (2018) demonstrated that verapamil impacts ATP production and membrane energetics in M. tuberculosis, suggesting that its primary antibacterial effect may derive from disruption of membrane potential and energy-dependent processes, rather than through direct inhibition of efflux pump proteins [23]. Additionally, Viljoen et al. (2019) reported similar findings where verapamil potentiated bedaquiline activity against Mycobacterium abscessus, potentially through general membrane destabilisation and energy depletion, rather than via specific pump targeting [24]. Thus, these studies collectively indicate mechanistic ambiguity, raising the possibility that verapamil\u2019s effects may involve non-specific membrane disruption or impairment of bacterial energetics in addition to, or instead of direct efflux pump inhibition. A critical limitation remains the pharmacokinetic mismatch, as plasma concentrations achievable with standard verapamil dosing are below repurposing the MICs required for bacterial efflux inhibition [23]. Additionally, higher doses pose cardiotoxicity and hypotension risks, precluding its systemic antibacterial use.\nImportantly, verapamil demonstrates in vitro efflux inhibition and antibiotic synergy with multiple agents, including ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, bedaquiline, and clofazimine. This effect is particularly evident against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, multidrug-resistant strains such as R543, and S. aureus NorA-expressing strains. However, no studies were identified assessing dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, felodipine, lercanidipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, nisoldipine, clevidipine, isradipine, or nimodipine for bacterial efflux pump inhibition, synergy, or MIC/FIC evaluation. This represents a significant knowledge gap in antimicrobial repurposing literature, highlighting an urgent need for systematic evaluation of dihydropyridine derivatives. Future investigations should rigorously define mechanisms of action, conduct validated checkerboard and time-kill synergy assays, assess pharmacokinetic feasibility, and evaluate toxicity profiles to advance calcium channel blockers as viable antimicrobial adjuvant strategies.\n\n## 2.1.4. Statins\nStatins, widely used as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors, have also been investigated for their direct antibacterial properties and potential synergy with antibiotics. Ko et al. (2017) reported that simvastatin exhibited direct antibacterial activity against S. aureus, with MICs ranging from 15.6 to 31.25 \u00b5g/mL, whereas other statins such as pravastatin showed minimal activity (MIC > 128 \u00b5g/mL) [25]. Mechanistically, the antibacterial action is hypothesised to involve disruption of bacterial cell membranes and inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis. Checkerboard assays revealed FIC indices indicative of synergism (<0.5) when simvastatin was combined with tetracycline against S. aureus [25].\nAnother investigation highlighted simvastatin and atorvastatin MICs of 64\u2013128 \u00b5g/mL against Gram-positive bacterial strains, with hypothesised mechanisms involving interference with lipid raft formation and efflux pump inhibition [3]. However, synergy tests (checkerboard assays) with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin yielded mostly additive rather than synergistic FIC indices (>0.5, \u22641), indicating limited potentiation. Statins have been shown to modulate efflux pumps in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with simvastatin in combination with levofloxacin yielding an MIC of 32 \u00b5g/mL and an FIC index of 0.31 [26]. Additionally, these findings were interpreted as synergistic using checkerboard methodology, with statins shown to inhibit bacterial efflux mechanisms and enhance intracellular antibiotic concentrations.\nRampelotto et al. (2018) tested combinations of atorvastatin with a Ru-based antimicrobial complex against E. coli and S. aureus, reporting MIC reductions from >128 \u00b5g/mL to 4 \u00b5g/mL for atorvastatin in the combination [27]. FIC indices ranged from 0.17 to 0.5 (synergistic), using checkerboard microdilution assays. A Ru-based antimicrobial complex is a metal\u2013organic compound containing ruthenium, which exhibits antibacterial activity through mechanisms including membrane disruption and ROS generation. However, mechanistic evaluations were lacking in that study, representing a notable research gap. Another study showed that combining rosuvastatin with levofloxacin resulted in reduced MIC from 4 \u00b5g/mL to 0.5 \u00b5g/mL against S. aureus, with an FIC index of 0.3, indicating potent synergy [28]. Mechanistically, the authors proposed that rosuvastatin enhances bacterial membrane permeability, thereby facilitating antibiotic influx. Additionally, rosuvastatin combined with cefixime showed synergy against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, with cefixime MIC reductions of 2\u20134-fold and FIC indices ranging from 0.37 to 0.49 [29]. Their conclusion highlighted several limitations in the study, including the lack of in vivo pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies, which represents an essential translational barrier. Azole antifungals combined with statins were tested against Candida auris, showing MIC reductions; however, FIC indices ranged from 0.5 to 1.0, indicating primarily additive interactions [30]. Mechanistic insights suggested statins disrupt fungal ergosterol pathways. Further evidence suggested synergy against dermatophytes, with atorvastatin showing an MIC of 64 \u00b5g/mL and a synergistic FIC index of 0.45 when combined with terbinafine against Trichophyton rubrum [31].\nOverall, statins exhibit modest direct antimicrobial activity (MICs generally 15.6\u2013128 \u00b5g/mL) and synergistic interactions with various antibiotics including tetracycline, levofloxacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, cefixime, and azoles (FIC indices < 0.5\u20131). Checkerboard assays dominated synergy testing methodologies. Mechanistic studies suggest membrane disruption, efflux pump inhibition, and isoprenoid pathway interference, although these remain under-characterised and primarily hypothesised, rather than validated. Clinical limitations include toxicity at concentrations required for antibacterial effects, the lack of in vivo validation, and the absence of pharmacodynamic interaction studies. These gaps highlight the need for further investigation before translational applications can be pursued.\n\n## 2.1.5. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) demonstrate variable antibacterial activity and synergy with antibiotics. Ahmed et al. (2017) reported ibuprofen MICs of 256\u2013512 \u00b5g/mL and diclofenac MICs of 64\u2013128 \u00b5g/mL against E. coli. Checkerboard assays showed synergistic FIC indices (<0.5) when diclofenac was combined with gentamicin or ciprofloxacin [32]. No efflux pump inhibition studies were performed; mechanisms were hypothesised as membrane or enzyme interference. Another study assessed ibuprofen (MIC 250\u2013500 \u00b5g/mL), diclofenac (MIC 125\u2013250 \u00b5g/mL), and aspirin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [33]. Checkerboard synergy tests yielded FIC indices of 0.313\u20130.625 with cefuroxime or chloramphenicol, indicating synergistic to additive effects. The authors proposed that NSAIDs may inhibit bacterial efflux pump systems, leading to increased intracellular antibiotic concentrations, although efflux pump inhibition assays were not conducted.\nCelecoxib tested in combination with oxacillin against S. aureus showed an MIC of 32 \u00b5g/mL and a synergistic FIC index of 0.25 [34]. The mechanism proposed was membrane disruption, and no efflux pump inhibition studies were performed. Aspirin and ibuprofen were investigated in combination with oxytetracycline against Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica [35]. MICs of oxytetracycline decreased from 8 \u00b5g/mL to 1 \u00b5g/mL when combined with ibuprofen, yielding an FIC index of 0.25 (synergistic) [35]. That research hypothesised efflux pump inhibition but performed no experimental validation.\nDiclofenac (MIC 64 \u00b5g/mL) combined with gentamicin against S. aureus showed a synergistic effect, with an FIC index of 0.38 [36]. Efflux pump inhibition was suggested as a mechanism but was not directly tested. Additionally, diclofenac combined with essential oils against Candida spp. showed MIC reductions with synergistic FIC indices (<0.5). [37]. Mechanisms proposed included membrane disruption and oxidative stress induction, although no efflux pump inhibition assays were performed. Another finding reported ibuprofen MICs of 2048 \u00b5g/mL with synergistic FIC indices (<0.5) when combined with ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa [38]. This NSAID-antibiotic combination also decreased efflux pump gene expression in this bacterial species, while suppressing biofilm formation and other virulence. Sekar et al. (2024) investigated ketorolac with gentamicin against S. aureus biofilms, reporting significant MIC reductions and an FIC index of 0.31 (synergistic) [39]. The mechanism was attributed to biofilm matrix modulation, and no efflux pump inhibition studies were performed.\nInclusive, NSAIDs exhibit weak to moderate direct antibacterial activity (MICs 32\u2013512 \u00b5g/mL) and synergistic effects with antibiotics including gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, oxacillin, chloramphenicol, cefuroxime, and tetracycline (FIC indices generally <0.5\u20130.625). Checkerboard assays are the main synergy testing method. Although efflux pump inhibition is frequently proposed as a key mechanism, none of the reviewed studies performed direct assays (e.g., ethidium bromide accumulation/efflux assays, or efflux gene expression analysis) to confirm this hypothesis. This represents a critical knowledge gap requiring targeted molecular studies before NSAIDs can be advanced as efflux pump modulators or antibacterial adjuvants in clinical settings.\nOverall, non-antibiotic drugs acting as efflux pump inhibitors offer a promising strategy to overcome bacterial multidrug resistance, potentially restoring antibiotic efficacy against otherwise resistant pathogens. However, translational challenges remain substantial, including achieving clinically relevant concentrations without inducing systemic toxicity, ensuring pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic compatibility for co-administration with antibiotics, and confirming mechanistic specificity towards bacterial rather than human efflux systems to avoid off-target effects. Furthermore, the lack of direct efflux pump inhibition assays in current studies represents a critical limitation, necessitating molecular confirmation to validate this proposed mechanism before advancing non-antibiotic drugs as safe, effective adjuvants in antimicrobial therapy.\n\n## 2.2. Biofilm Inhibition and Disruption of Bacterial Membranes\nTable 2 outlines the reported antibiofilm and membrane-disruptive activities of non-antibiotic drugs. Promising findings are limited by a lack of MBIC/MBEC values and direct mechanistic assays.\n\n## 2.2.1. Phenothiazine Antipsychotics\nPhenothiazine antipsychotics, such as thioridazine and chlorpromazine, have been explored as antimicrobial adjuvants via biofilm inhibition mechanisms. Thioridazine was reported to disrupt biofilms formed by M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium ulcerans [40], although no minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) or minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) numerical values were provided. The mechanism was attributed to efflux pump inhibition, thereby enhancing intracellular antibiotic accumulation. Although potentiation with 20 antibiotics was observed, no FIC indices or MIC reduction data were reported, representing a significant quantitative gap in the literature. Membrane disruption assays such as propidium iodide (PI) uptake, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), or membrane potential measurements were not performed, leaving direct bactericidal membrane-targeting effects unconfirmed.\nSimilarly, chlorpromazine was highlighted as an efflux pump inhibitor, particularly against NorA in S. aureus, contributing to reduced bacterial persistence and biofilm resilience [41,42]. However, no MBIC or MBEC values were reported, and membrane disruption assays, PI uptake assays, SEM, TEM, or membrane potential assays were not conducted. Another study investigated the use of branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) as an antibiotic potentiator against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) biofilms [43]. Combination with amoxicillin restored MRSE susceptibility by inhibiting PBP2a (penicillin-binding protein 2a), which normally confers resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Notably, MIC or MBIC reduction values were not reported, although BPEI broadened antibiotic spectrum against other pathogens, including MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli. Mechanistic assays reported in that study included microtiter biofilm assays, time-kill curves, and SEM. This supports BPEI as a promising broad-spectrum antibiotic adjuvant targeting biofilm-associated resistance.\nCurrent evidence supports phenothiazines as efflux pump inhibitors with potential anti-biofilm effects, yet robust experimental validation is lacking, with no direct MBIC, MBEC, or membrane disruption data available. Furthermore, synergy testing remains largely conceptual, without FIC or MIC reduction data reported. Clinical translation of phenothiazines is constrained by cardiotoxicity (e.g., QT interval prolongation) and central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects, thereby limiting systemic therapeutic repurposing. Future studies must integrate quantitative biofilm assays, direct membrane integrity evaluations, and structured synergy profiling to enable rational development of phenothiazine-based antimicrobial adjuvant therapies.\n\n## 2.2.2. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors\nSSRIs including fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine have demonstrated antimicrobial effects against multiple bacterial pathogens. Endo et al. (2025) evaluated SSRIs against ESKAPEE bacteria (Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and E. coli) [16]. That study reported membrane disruption activity confirmed via dye uptake assays, indicating increased bacterial membrane permeability as part of their mechanism. However, no MBIC, MBEC values, or % biofilm viability reduction data were reported. Additionally, no SEM, TEM or membrane potential assays were conducted. Another study investigated fluoxetine in combination with antibiotics including ampicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid against Gram-positive skin and soft tissue pathogens including S. aureus (including MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis [44]. Whilst synergistic effects were proposed, no FIC indices or MIC/MBIC reduction values were reported. A systematic review evaluated the antimicrobial activity of SSRIs against both bacteria and fungi [45]. The review highlighted that fluoxetine and sertraline exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, as well as fungal pathogens including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis. However, that study did not report MBIC or MBEC values, nor any quantitative biofilm viability reduction data. Additionally, no membrane disruption assays such as PI uptake, SEM, TEM, or membrane potential assays were performed in those studies. Whilst potential synergy with antifungal agents was discussed, no FIC indices or MIC reduction data were provided. Overall, whilst this review supports SSRIs\u2019 broad antimicrobial potential, it underscores a critical lack of quantitative biofilm inhibition and direct membrane disruption evidence, limiting their current translational applicability as antifungal or antibacterial adjuvants. Another investigation described biofilm disruption by SSRIs in environmental isolates such as Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, and Enterobacter spp., yet no quantitative biofilm inhibition data or mechanistic assays were included [46].\nOverall, whilst SSRIs exhibit membrane-disruptive antimicrobial activity and potential synergy with antibiotics including ampicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid, robust experimental validation is lacking, as no studies reported direct MBIC, MBEC, % biofilm reduction, FIC indices, or MIC fold-reduction values in combination settings. Future studies must prioritise these quantitative endpoints alongside detailed membrane integrity assays to enable rational repurposing of SSRIs as antimicrobial adjuvants.\n\n## 2.2.3. Calcium Channel Blockers\nCCBs, comprising phenylalkylamines such as verapamil and diltiazem, and dihydropyridines such as nifedipine and amlodipine, have been proposed as potential antimicrobial adjuvants due to their pharmacological effects on bacterial physiology. However, the current literature provides no experimental evidence reporting MBIC, MBEC, or % biofilm viability reduction data for these agents against bacterial or fungal biofilms. Furthermore, no membrane disruption assays (PI uptake, SEM, TEM, or membrane potential measurements) have been performed to confirm any direct membrane-targeting antimicrobial mechanism for either drug class.\nWhilst verapamil is well-recognised in pharmacological literature as an efflux pump inhibitor [20], which enhances intracellular antibiotic concentrations in bacteria, this property has only been studied in the context of planktonic bacterial resistance reversal [21], not as a biofilm inhibitory or membrane-disrupting agent in combination studies. Importantly, no studies have investigated combinations of verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, or amlodipine with antibiotics to assess MIC reduction or FIC indices in biofilm models, nor have they reported direct synergy against mature biofilms.\nOverall, there exists a critical knowledge gap across both classes of CCBs regarding their biofilm inhibition potential, direct membrane-disruptive effects, and antimicrobial synergy. Future research should prioritise structured MBIC/MBEC assays, membrane integrity evaluations, and combination studies with clinically relevant antibiotics to determine their viability as antimicrobial adjuvants, while concurrently addressing safety limitations associated with cardiovascular pharmacodynamics in systemic applications.\n\n## 2.2.4. Statins\nStatins, particularly simvastatin, have been investigated for their antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects against S. aureus. Simvastatin was evaluated using a crystal violet assay to quantify biofilm biomass, alongside colony-forming unit (CFU) counts to assess bacterial viability within biofilms [47]. That study demonstrated inhibition of biofilm formation and reduction in bacterial viability, although no MBIC or MBEC values were reported. Membrane disruption assays (PI uptake, SEM, TEM, membrane potential) were not conducted. Additionally, a checkerboard assay was used to test synergy between simvastatin and vancomycin against planktonic S. aureus cells, suggesting potential synergy. However, no FIC indices or MIC reduction values were reported for biofilm settings.\nAnother study evaluated statins against S. aureus UAMS-1 biofilms using the MBEC assay [48]. However, no numerical MBEC values were provided in that study, and no membrane disruption assays or synergy evaluations with antibiotics were conducted. Whilst statins are hypothesised to exert antimicrobial effects through interference with bacterial isoprenoid biosynthesis and cell membrane integrity, direct mechanistic confirmation through membrane disruption assays remains to be investigated.\nOverall, current evidence suggests that statins such as simvastatin exhibit antibiofilm activity against S. aureus and potential synergy with antibiotics, yet robust quantitative validation is lacking, with no reported MBIC, MBEC, membrane disruption data, or synergy indices.
