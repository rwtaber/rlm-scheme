  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Global emergence of rapidly developing resistance to multiple antifungal drugs and high mortality pose challenges to the treatment of invasive Candida auris infections. New therapeutic approaches are needed, such as repurposing drugs including combination with antifungals. Statins have been reported to exert antifungal effects against various Candida species. OBJECTIVES: Our study investigated potential synergy between the statins (rosuvastatin and fluvastatin) and azoles (voriconazole, posaconazole and isavuconazole) on clinical isolates of C. auris. METHODS: Twenty-one clinical isolates of C. auris were obtained. Chequerboard assays based on the CLSI broth microdilution method were used to assess synergy based on FIC index (FICI) calculations of MICs of individual drugs and in combinations. RESULTS: Single drug geometric mean (GM) MICs of fluvastatin and rosuvastatin were \u2265128\u2005mg/L in all 21 isolates. GM (range) MICs of posaconazole, voriconazole and isavuconazole were 0.259 (0.016-1\u2005mg/L), 0.469 (0.016-2\u2005mg/L) and 0.085 (0.004-1\u2005mg/L), respectively. Combination of azoles with fluvastatin showed synergy in 70%-90% of C. auris isolates. In particular, voriconazole/fluvastatin resulted in 16-fold reduction in voriconazole MIC and synergy in 14/21 (67%) isolates. Posaconazole/fluvastatin resulted in 8-fold reduction in posaconazole MIC and synergy in 19/21 (90%) isolates.Combining rosuvastatin with the azoles also showed synergy against C. auris in 40%-60% of the isolates and additive effect in 40%-50%. None of the combinations was antagonistic. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a rationale for pursuing in vivo synergy tests as well as clinical studies to explore tolerability, treatment outcomes, optimal dose and exposure targets.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nIn the last 10\u2005years, Candida auris has established it presence with outbreaks or invasive infections in multiple countries.1 It can be divided into four major clades: South Asia, East Asia, Africa and South America, although a fifth clade has been described.2\nAzoles are potent treatment options for Candida infections, with voriconazole, posaconazole and isavuconazole demonstrating MIC90 of 0.125\u20132\u2005mg/L against C. auris.1,3,4 However, clinical isolates of C. auris show high MICs of fluconazole with 87%\u2013100% resistance rates, in parallel with variable rates of resistance to other antifungal drugs.1 Further, pandrug-resistant isolates, i.e. resistance to \u22652 classes of antifungal drugs including the echinocandins, have been increasingly observed with high mortality rates.5,6\nTreatment guidelines for C. auris recommend echinocandins as first-line therapy in adult patients, and amphotericin B formulations in neonates and infants <2\u2005months of age.7 Both these drug classes must be given IV. Hence, if the activity of azoles could be increased by their combination with other oral agents with resultant synergy, this would offer early and effective \u2018step down\u2019 or even initial therapy options. One class of such agents is the statins, showing anti-inflammatory and direct growth-inhibitory effects on microorganisms.8 Traditionally, combination of azoles with statins has been considered a risk due to drug\u2013drug interactions. However, posaconazole and isavuconazole are less strong inhibitors of human CYP450 enzymes and some statins are less of a substrate of these enzymes.9\nIn our study, two statins (fluvastatin and rosuvastatin) were selected based on minimal drug\u2013drug interaction risks9 and previously reported synergy against other Candida species.8\nThese were investigated for potential synergy with azoles (voriconazole, posaconazole and isavuconazole) against C. auris.\n\n## Materials\nTwenty-one clinical isolates of C. auris obtained from the Clinical Mycology Reference Laboratory, Centre for Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Services, Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research at Westmead Hospital (Table 1) were studied. They were from Australia (n\u200a=\u200a7), India (n\u200a=\u200a6), the US CDC (n\u200a=\u200a5) and South Africa (n\u200a=\u200a3). All isolates were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar for 24\u201348\u2005h at 35\u00b0C and identity confirmed by internal transcribed spacer sequencing10 and MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Voriconazole, posaconazole and fluvastatin were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Australia, and isavuconazole and rosuvastatin from Sapphire Bioscience, Australia (all \u226598% purity).\n\n## Methods\nDrug susceptibility of 21 C. auris isolates was tested.11 \u00a0Pichia kudriavzevii (Candida krusei) ATCC 6258 was the quality control strain. Drug solutions were made by dissolving in DMSO then diluting in RPMI-1640 medium (with glutamine and phenol red but without bicarbonate) to allow for final well concentrations of 16\u2013128\u2005mg/L for fluvastatin and rosuvastatin, and 0.004\u20132\u2005mg/L for voriconazole, posaconazole and isavuconazole.\nFor inoculum,11 0.5 McFarland suspensions of each C. auris isolate were prepared and diluted 1:50 then 1:20 in RPMI-1640 to a final inoculum of 1\u200a\u00d7\u200a103\u20135\u200a\u00d7\u200a103\u2005cfu/mL. A 96-well U-shaped plate was used for drug susceptibility testing and incubated at 35\u00b0C for 24\u2005h. The MIC of the azole was the lowest concentration demonstrating 50% growth reduction relative to the control. MICs for each drug alone and azole/statin combinations were determined using the chequerboard broth microdilution method.12 Each well was inoculated with the abovementioned C. auris and serial drug concentrations. The FIC index (FICI) was calculated using the equation: (MIC Drug A combined/MIC Drug A alone)\u200a+\u200a(MIC Drug B combined/MIC Drug B alone). FICI\u200a\u2264\u200a0.5 was considered synergistic, 0.5\u200a<\u200aFICI\u200a\u2264\u200a1 additive, 1\u200a<\u200aFICI\u200a<\u200a4 no interaction and FICI\u200a\u2265\u200a4 antagonistic. For statins, if there were still substantial growth at the maximum concentration tested (i.e. >128\u2005mg/L), an MIC of 256\u2005mg/L was assumed. Assays were performed in duplicate.\n\n## Results\nFluvastatin and rosuvastatin alone showed MICs of \u2265128\u2005mg/L for the P. kudriavzevii ATCC 6258 and all 21 test isolates. Posaconazole, voriconazole and isavuconazole showed geometric mean (GM) MICs of 0.259 (range 0.016\u20131\u2005mg/L), 0.469 (range 0.016\u20132\u2005mg/L) and 0.085 (range 0.004\u20131\u2005mg/L), respectively (Table 1). Currently no established interpretive clinical breakpoints (CBPs) or epidemiological cut-off values (ECVs) are available for azoles against C. auris,13 except for the tentatively suggested BP of MIC\u200a\u2265\u200a32\u2005mg/L for fluconazole.14 Based on the earlier data from our laboratory, fluconazole showed MICs of 128\u2005mg/L, and hence no further synergy testing was performed (data on file, not shown).\nIn all combinations (Table 2), fluvastatin and rosuvastatin both showed at least 62%\u201374% reduction (from >128 to 33.1\u201349.1\u2005mg/L) in their GM MIC values when combined with the azoles. This is based on the highest tested MIC of 128\u2005mg/L for statins and potentially indicates even greater MIC reduction based on their true MIC values.\nVoriconazole/fluvastatin showed a decreased GM MIC of 0.029/39 (range 0.004/16\u20131/128\u2005mg/L) indicating 16-fold reduction in voriconazole MIC. The GM FICI was 0.288 (range 0.031\u20130.75), of which 14 of 21 isolates (67%) showed synergy and 7 (33%) showed additive effect.\nPosaconazole/fluvastatin showed decreased GM MIC of 0.031/33.1 (range 0.004/16\u20130.25/128\u2005mg/L), indicating 8-fold reduction in posaconazole MIC. The corresponding GM FICI was 0.341 (range 0.189\u20130.75). The majority of the isolates (19 of 21 isolates, 90%) showed synergy and 2 isolates showed additive effective.\nIsavuconazole/fluvastatin showed decreased GM MIC of 0.022/33.1 (range 0.004/16\u20130.5/128\u2005mg/L), indicating 4-fold reduction in isavuconazole MIC. Although the extent of MIC reduction was lower compared with other azoles, the GM FICI was 0.446 (range 0.189\u20131.13), with 15 (71%) isolates showing synergy. Five isolates (24%) showed an additive effect and one showed indifference.\nCombination of rosuvastatin with voriconazole resulted in a slightly lower proportion of isolates demonstrating synergy (12 of 21 isolates, 57%) and 9 (43%) showed additive effect. The GM FICI was 0.364 (range 0.031\u20131). This combination resulted in a pronounced decrease in voriconazole MIC, similar to voriconazole/fluvastatin, and demonstrated about 12-fold reduction with GM MIC of 0.040/49.1 (range 0.004/16\u20130.5/128\u2005mg/L).\nIsavuconazole/rosuvastatin showed only 3-fold reduction in isavuconazole MIC with decreased GM MIC of 0.026/49.1 (range 0.004/16\u20130.5/128\u2005mg/L). The GM FICI was 0.568 (0.313\u20131.06), of which 9 (43%) isolates showed synergy, 11 (52%) showed additive effect and 1 showed no difference.\nComparably, posaconazole/rosuvastatin showed 4-fold reduction in posaconazole MIC with decreased GM MIC of 0.074/41.7 (range 0.004/16\u20130.5/128\u2005mg/L). The GM FICI was 0.529 (0.189\u20131), of which 11 (52%) of 21 isolates showed synergy and 10 (48%) showed additive effect. None of the drug combinations tested resulted in antagonism.\nRegional differences in FICI were not obvious due to the small number of isolates (mostly \u22643 isolates) not allowing distribution analysis. However, seven isolates from Australia and six from India still allowed preliminary assessment of FICI values in different azole and statin combinations (Figure 1). The variability in FICI values was more pronounced in isolates from India. We observed a trend of lower FICI for voriconazole/fluvastatin combination in isolates from Australia compared with isolates from India (median FICI 0.26 versus 0.52). Similarly, for voriconazole/rosuvastatin, FICI values showed a tendency of lower median values in isolates from Australia compared with India (median FICI 0.56 versus 0.88).\n\n## Discussion\nIn our study, combining fluvastatin with posaconazole, voriconazole or isavuconazole resulted in synergistic effect in 70%\u201390% of the clinical C. auris isolates. In particular, voriconazole/fluvastatin showed 16-fold reduction in MIC of voriconazole alone, and posaconazole/fluvastatin showed 8-fold reduction in MIC of posaconazole alone. Although less pronounced, combining rosuvastatin with the azoles also showed synergistic effect against C. auris in 40%\u201360% of the isolates and additive effect in 40%\u201350% of the isolates.\nStatins have been reported to have antifungal effects on various fungal pathogens including Candida spp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus spp., mucormycetes and dermatophytes,15 and to sensitize response to azoles and polyenes.15,16\nA multicentre cohort study of 326 candidaemia patients also reported a significantly lower early 5\u2005day case fatality rate of 4.5% in statin users, compared with 17% in non-statin users.17\nSynergistic interactions between statins and azoles were explored for clinically important fungi including Candida albicans and Candida glabrata.8 Itraconazole and rosuvastatin combination demonstrated synergy against 11 clinical isolates of C. albicans with interaction ratio (IR) of 1.79, and fluconazole and fluvastatin combination showed an IR of 1.70 (where IR\u200a>\u200a0.5 indicates synergy). That study also observed no antagonistic effect from the azole and statin combination, as was the case in our study.\nPotential synergy mechanisms could include statins\u2019 interruption of intracellular ergosterol biosynthesis through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, decreased activation of key cellular proteins involved in cellular respiration and metabolism, and apoptosis induction.15 Azoles are also believed to interrupt ergosterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent 14\u03b1-lanosterol demethylase.8\nIn a more recent study, a third-generation statin, pitavastatin, demonstrated synergy with voriconazole against 16 strains of C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. auris (\u03a3FICI ranged from 0.15 to 0.50, where \u03a3FICI \u2264 0.5 indicates synergy).18\nPitavastatin does not undergo major metabolism through cytochrome P450 (CYP), especially CYP3A4, just like rosuvastatin and fluvastatin, which undergo minimal metabolism by CYP2C9, thus reducing the potential for drug\u2013drug interactions concerning azole and statin.19\nLimitations of our study include potentially underestimated synergistic or additive interactions as the assumption was made for statin MICs of 256\u2005mg/L for FICI calculations, when the growth still occurred at >128\u2005mg/L. This also could mean that some of the weaker additive interactions with rosuvastatin could possibly be reclassified as synergistic to the greater extent if different maximum concentration was tested. However, the concentration ranges in our study are sufficient to define drug class-specific resistance and align with MIC testing in other studies.20 The pronounced synergistic interactions between the azoles and statins for C. auris is notable. Larger sample size in each region would also have enabled statistical analyses to see regional differences in FICI values.\nOverall, our study provides promising in vitro data for statin/azole combinations against C. auris and a good rationale for further exploration in murine models of disseminated C. auris infection, especially testing at clinically relevant drug concentrations.21 As clinical data are now available to support prolonged combined use, a prospective multidose Phase 1 study demonstrating safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers is the essential next step. Surveillance data will enable better understanding of MIC distributions in different regions, and guide establishment of BP concentrations for azoles against C. auris. This will help define the role of statins in potentially reversing azole resistance in C. auris treatment.",
