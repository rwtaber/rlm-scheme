  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nIn recent decades, engineered nanomaterials have been obtained and tested in new and different applications (medicine [1], environment [2], energy [3], etc.). Synthesis methods have been intensively developed so that a great variety of nanostructures can be obtained [4]. Nanoparticles (NPs) have specific physical\u2013chemical characteristics like a high surface-to-volume ratio, high reactivity, and amenability to surface modification [5]. These properties recommend them for antimicrobial applications, being able to effectively target and kill Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Nowadays, the accelerated spread of antibiotic resistance and the small number of newly released antibiotics have caused a strong preoccupation to develop new strategies to defeat this public health threat [6]. NPs have already proven that they can be an alternative to classic antimicrobial agents, being unlikely to induce antimicrobial resistance [7,8], although some forms of resistance in the case of Ag have been reported [9,10]. Although there is extensive research, the antibacterial mechanism of nanostructured materials is not fully elucidated [11], and three plausible routes have been proposed: (i) reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, (ii) the release of metal ions in aqueous media, and (iii) electrostatic interaction with the cell wall.\nAmong antimicrobial nanomaterials, ZnO has been reported to exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial properties against [12] viruses [13,14,15] and fungi [16,17], and is generally regarded as safe for humans. The interest in ZnO is facilitated by the relative ease of the synthesis of different kinds of morphologies [9]. Nano-ZnO can act against bacteria mainly through ROS generation, where the electron\u2013hole pairs generated by the light irradiation create free radicals which, consequently, destroy cellular constituents. The wide band gap of ZnO results in a relatively low ROS production in the visible range, being more active in the UV range. One approach aiming to extend the light absorption to the visible region is coupling with plasmonic metals [18]. With the formation of the metal\u2013semiconductor interface, the semiconductor\u2019s ability to absorb light in the visible range is improved and the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is hindered, leading to the augmentation of ROS generation. Different ZnO/noble metal nanocomposites have been increasingly developed, mainly for photocatalytic applications [19,20]. The usage of these plasmonic nanocomposites against microbes is a hot topic [18], and research still needs to be undertaken to yield results that can be transferred into practical applications. Au and Ag can enhance the photocatalytic antimicrobial action of ZnO, and they can also enhance treatment efficiency due to their intrinsic antimicrobial activity [21]. In a previous study, we demonstrated that ZnO/Au nanocomposites, composed of small ZnO nanorods and small AuNPs, work through a synergistic action, proving to be more effective against E. coli and S. aureus than ZnO alone [22]. Comparing the two metals, AuNPs have the advantage of a high degree of stability and biocompatibility, while AgNPs have shown undeniable antimicrobial qualities. Hern\u00e1ndez-Sierra et al. reported a comparative investigation of the bactericidal activity of Ag, ZnO, and Au nanoparticles on Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) [23] and showed that Ag nanoparticles exhibited the most activity in controlling S. mutans, the main cause of dental caries. AgNPs deposited onto ZnO proved to have better biocompatibility than metallic nanoparticles while preserving their antimicrobial properties [24,25].\nAnother promising application of nano-ZnO is in photocatalysis, as an eco-friendly and effective photoactive material that can degrade different recalcitrant organic compounds pollutants from wastewater [26]. Conventional wastewater treatment methods do not completely mineralize, even after a long processing time. The key aspect of photodegradation processes over ZnO nanostructures is the utilization of photoexcited charge carriers to break down selected contaminants into non-toxic substances. The photocatalytic removal of organic compounds implies the adsorption of the organic pollutants on the surface of the catalyst, oxidation, and reduction reactions at the interface, triggered under various light irradiations, resulting in the complete mineralization of the pollutant. ZnO has emerged as one of the most preferable photocatalyst candidates because of its strong UV absorption and high initial activity rate; also, it is safe for the environment and cheaper to produce than TiO2. However, the practical application of ZnO is hindered due to its large band gap energy, being active mostly under UV irradiation, and due to the rapid recombination of the photoinduced electron\u2013hole pairs, faster than the surface redox reactions [27]. One promising approach to modulate the absorption of ZnO and to overcome the rapid recombination of charge carriers is the coupling of noble metals with nano-ZnO [28,29,30], using the surface plasmon resonance properties of noble metals [8]. Au and Ag nanoparticles can extend the light absorption to the visible range and can prolong the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes. The Schottky barrier established at the metal\u2013semiconductor interface can increase photocatalytic activity by preventing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, increasing the interfacial charge transfer between the noble metal and semiconductor, and prolonging the carrier lifetime [31,32]. Upon modification with Au or Ag, the metal centers act as an electron sink/trap in ZnO, increasing the photocatalysis efficiency under visible and UV irradiation. The weak electrostatic interactions between noble metals and ZnO are the main challenge for the synthesis of nanocomposites with a good dispersion of metal nanoparticles in the oxide matrix. It is important to ensure the heterogeneous growth of noble metal nanoparticles on ZnO to create metal\u2013ZnO heterojunctions. It was demonstrated that a small quantity of noble metals is needed to induce improvements in organic degradation time. Adding 1% Ag to a ZnO photocatalyst-coated microreactor led to 91% degradation of methylene blue dye from water under UV-A irradiation for 2.5 min [33]. Other researchers found that the content of 1.5% AgNPs in nanocomposites was the most favorable for maximizing the photocatalytic performances, and that exceeding this percentage decreased the photodegradation efficiency [31]. Various Au/ZnO heterostructures with different gold contents were reported as potential materials for photocatalysis. In reference [34], a 1.30% Au content in ZnO/Au nanomaterial achieved the best performance in the degradation of methylene blue dye and was superior compared to the effect of silver on ZnO effectiveness. Other researchers found that silver had a greater positive influence than gold in the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of Congo red dye under UV irradiation [29]. When employed as photocatalysts for methylene blue degradation, it was found that Au (3%)/ZnO exhibited superior performance than the pure ZnO [35].\nIn this article, we propose two types of nanocomposites, ZnO/Au and ZnO/Ag, with 1 wt.% noble metal content, and we compare their antimicrobial and photocatalytic performance. We synthesized the nanocomposites through the reduction of Au or Ag salts using citric acid in the presence of citrate-functionalized ZnO nanoparticles. The antibacterial activity of these nanomaterials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was investigated. The photocatalytic activity was measured by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) cationic dye in an aqueous solution. The objective of this study was to improve the antimicrobial and photocatalytic activity of ZnO through the introduction of reduced amounts of gold and silver into the ZnO matrix. Such a comparative study will eventually lead to the better utilization of these nanoparticles in killing dangerous bacteria or in the removal of toxic dyes from wastewater.\n\n## 2. Results and Discussion\nThe obtained nanomaterials received the codes according to Table 1 and were morphologically and functionally characterized by different techniques.\n\n## 2.1. Characterization of the ZnO/Au and ZnO/Ag Nanocomposites\nTo assess the structural features of the investigated samples, X-ray diffraction investigations were performed. Figure 1 presents the experimental XRD patterns, as well as the simulated data in the framework of the Rietveld refinement [36]. The diffractograms of the sample correspond to the wurtzite structure of zinc oxide, and other diffraction patterns corresponding to impurities or sodium citrate were not found, suggesting the high purity of the synthesized nanomaterials.\nThis refinement is based on the least-squares method of the theoretical profile against the experimental XRD spectrum. Briefly, the principle of the refinement lies in the minimization of a function M, which accounts for the difference between a calculated profile yicalc and the observed data yiobs, with the following form [37]:(1)M=\u2211Wiyiobs\u22121Syicalc2\nwhere Wi is the statistical weight and S is an overall scale factor such that yicalc=Syiobs. The values of the fitting parameters, Rwp (weighted parameter) and S (scale factor), are presented in Figure 1, and their goodness of fit is proved by reasonable values, i.e., Rwp~10% and S~1. The values for the unit cell parameters, crystallite size, and lattice strain determined using the Rietveld fit are listed in Table 2.\nAs can be seen from Table 1, the ZnO unit cell parameters were not affected during AuNP and AgNP synthesis, preserving the wurtzite crystal structure of ZnO with a = b = 0.32 nm, and c = 0.52 nm. The crystallite size of the commercial ZnO sample (unmodified) was 23.2 nm, and after citrate functionalization reached 31.1 nm. During the synthesis of AuNPs and AgNPs, the mean crystallite size of ZnO decreased to 27.5 nm in ZP2 and 25.3 nm in ZP3. This further implied an increase in the dislocation density (\u03c1), according to the following formula: \u03c1\u00a0~\u00a01\u03c42\u00a0, where \u03c4 is the mean crystallite size determined above [38]. At the same time, the lattice strain decreased from 0.73 to 0.42%, indicating a relaxation of the lattice simultaneously with the dislocation formation in the lattice. Overall, XRD analysis proved that the Au and Ag formation on ZnO NPs led only to a small worsening of the crystal quality by the formation of dislocations in the ZnO lattice.\nSEM micrographs of ZnO and composite samples are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, ZnO particles appeared as small, polycrystalline grains exhibiting diverse morphologies like small rods, irregular parallelepipeds, and spheres, with a wide range of particle size distribution. Nanoparticles of different morphologies were well dispersed. The citrate used in the first stage of the composites\u2019 synthesis acted as a dispersant for the commercial ZnO nanoparticles (which can be covered with organic stabilizers). The carboxylate anions attached to the positively charged surface of ZnO, forming a Zn2+\u2013citrate complex, keeping the ZnO NPs away from each other [39]. The elongated particles of commercial ZnO had a mean length of 131.6 +/4.4 nm (N = 150) and the spherical ones had a mean diameter of 43.1 +/1.5 nm (N = 250). During citrate functionalization, the ZnO NPs underwent some morphological changes, especially in the case of the aspherical particles\u2014the length of these nanoparticles increased, with the mean length being 199.5 +/8.2 nm (N =150)\u2014while their diameter remained constant. Citrate ions were preferentially adsorbed on the positively charged zinc (001) plane, favoring the selective growth of the wurtzite crystal [40]. At the same time, the spherical NPs slightly decreased in diameter after the citric acid treatment to 41.1 +/1.1 nm (N = 250). Since the SEM analysis technique cannot distinguish between ZnO, Au, and Ag, the changes that appeared after the Ag and Au synthesis were highlighted through the statistical analysis of the nanoparticle\u2019s dimensions (Figure S1). In both nanocomposites, the number of particles that were less than 50 nm in diameter increased compared with those from the ZP1 sample. TEM analysis was performed on Au and Ag nanoparticles obtained in the absence of ZnO to generate additional information about the shape and dimensions of these nanoparticles. Therefore, the AuNPs appeared to be polycrystalline and near-spherical in shape with diameters ranging from 5 to 35 nm (inset of ZP2 SEM image\u2014Figure 2), and the AgNPs were rounder in shape with sizes between 8 and 40 nm (inset of ZP3 SEM image\u2014Figure 2). Also, transmission electron micrographs showed that the gold nanoparticles were less polydisperse than the AgNPs, with most nanoparticles being around 30 nm in diameter. The EDS analysis proved the presence of Au in the ZP2 nanocomposite and of Ag in the ZP3 sample (Figure 2), and the values were similar to those obtained from the ICP-OES analysis: Au content was 1.12 wt.% and Ag was 0.97 wt.%. All the samples contained carbon from citrate groups, the amount being greater in both nanocomposites than in ZP1.\nDuring the synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles, ZnO nanocrystals acted as seeding material for the nucleation of gold or silver nanocrystals [24]. Sodium citrate was used as a reducing agent for HAuCl4 (precursor of AuNPs) and AgNO3 (precursor of AgNPs), respectively. The reduction reactions can be listed as the following [29]:4HAuCl4 + HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2\u00b72H2O + 3H2O\u21923HOOC(COONa) + 4Au + 16HCl (2)\nAgNO3 + HOC(COONa)(CH2COONa)2\u00b72H2O \u2192 3HOOC(COONa) + Ag + NaNO3(3)\nAlso, the citrate groups performed a dispersant role, preventing the agglomeration of the newly synthesized Ag and Au nanoparticles [41].\nThe nature of the interactions that occurred in the synthesis processes of the nanocomposites and the newly formed bonds were evaluated through FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 3 presents spectra for citrate-functionalized ZnO (ZP1) and the two nanocomposites (ZP2 and ZP3). All the spectra were characterized by absorption bands observed below 600 cm\u22121, which can be attributed to the vibrational mode of the Zn-O bonds in the wurtzite structure of ZnO [42].\nIn the case of ZP1, three absorption peaks are associated with the vibration mode of the Zn-O bonds, suggesting the coexistence of particles with different sizes. The treatment with citrate removes the organic additives from commercial ZnO (proved by the disappearance of certain bands in the FTIR spectrum of the ZP1 sample in comparison to that of commercial ZnO\u2014Figure S2). The peak centered at 439 cm\u22121, corresponding to the E1 (TO) mode of hexagonal ZnO in the ZP1 spectrum, undergoes a slight shift towards lower wavenumbers in ZP2 and ZP3 due to the formation of nanocomposites. However, FTIR spectroscopy cannot detect specific bonds of Au or Ag atoms, suggesting the existence of an electrostatic interaction between the oxide and metallic particles. The broad band centered at about 3440 cm\u22121 corresponds to the stretching of the O-H bonds, indicating the presence of moisture in all samples. Besides these, in the spectral range of 3000\u2013600 cm\u22121, peaks of different intensities associated with the process of synthesis and stabilization of nanoparticles can be observed, but without affecting the crystalline structure of ZnO, existing mainly near the surface of the oxide. The peaks associated with the mode of symmetric and asymmetric vibration of C-H bonds from saturated organic residues can be observed in the spectral range 3000\u20132800 cm\u22121. The bands in the range 2400\u20132000 cm\u22121 indicate the presence of adsorbed CO2 from the air on oxide nanoparticles. In the case of samples ZP2 and ZP3, the peaks in the range 1600\u2013800 cm\u22121 are associated with the mode of vibration of the bonds from the trisodium citrate used with a triple role in the synthesis process of metallic nanoparticles: reducing agent, size controller, and steric stabilizer [43]. The bands in the 1580\u20131400 region can be associated with the symmetric and asymmetric vibration mode of the bonds from the COO- group in the citrate that is electrostatically attached to the nanoparticles.\n\n## 2.2. Optical Properties\nThe optical absorbance spectra (Figure 4a) showed a strong absorption maximum located in the UV region and attributed to a large excitonic binding energy, as expected for ZnO. Also, some modifications in the absorption spectra can be induced by the small increase in the ZnO particle size (seen in SEM images\u2014Figure 3), which led to the scattering of light and the decrease in the crystallite size and lattice strain of wurtzite during nanocomposite synthesis (Table 2). For both nanocomposites, the absorption in the visible range increased, being more pronounced for ZnO/Au nanocomposites. The increase in optical absorption in the visible range compared to ZP1 may have occurred due to the surface plasmon resonance absorption of silver nanoparticles (between 400\u2013500 nm) and gold nanoparticles (between 500\u2013700 nm), which is evidence for the existence of ZnO\u2013Au and ZnO\u2013Ag interfaces. The stronger shift in the ZnO band position for ZnO/Au can be attributed to the higher electronegativity of gold when compared to silver, meaning that it is more efficient in pulling the electron density towards itself [44].\nThe band gap energies of the synthesized samples were determined by diffuse reflectance spectra (Figure 4b) [45], applying Equation (1). The results showed a small yet detectable decrease in the energy band of the nanocomposites, from 3.260 eV for ZP1 to 3.255 eV for ZnO/Au and 3.252 eV for ZnO/Ag. This was due to the AgNP and AuNP electrostatic interactions with the ZnO NPs, the decrease in the density of states, and screening of the Coulomb interaction with a smaller surface-to-volume ratio. The decrease in the band gap energy is in good agreement with the redshift observed in the absorbance spectra.\n\n## 2.3. Antimicrobial Activity\nThe results of the disk diffusion test for antimicrobial susceptibility are presented in Figure 5. As can be observed, ZP2 and ZP3 had a larger zone of bacterial growth inhibition compared to ZP1, for both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested. The antimicrobial effect of the nanomaterials showed a marked dependence on the chemical component of the material introduced into each of the agar discs. The sizes of the inhibition zones (IZ) of all the tested nanomaterials against P. aeruginosa were larger than those of IZ against S. aureus (Table 3), suggesting that P. aeruginosa was more sensitive to the nanomaterial action. The inhibition zones in the case of P. aeruginosa had no clear or regular boundaries, especially in the case of the nanocomposites, indicating that ions from the nanomaterials leached out from the disks in a different way compared to the case of the S. aureus bacteria dishes. In the S. aureus plates, all the inhibition zones were clear, meaning that a gradient of ion concentration was created around all the disks, suggesting that these bacteria were highly sensitive (susceptible) to the antimicrobial agent [46,47]. Also, all the tested nanomaterials prevented bacteria from growing or replicating, being able to kill bacteria.\nIn the case of the P. aeruginosa strain, discs impregnated with ZP1 had a diameter of IZ of 10 mm, the IZ diameter for the ZP2-impregnated disks was almost 80% greater than that observed for the ZP1 impregnated disks, and the IZ diameter increased by 30% for the ZP3 samples. Similarly, in the case of the S. aureus strain tests, the ZP1 induced an inhibition zone of 9 mm, while for ZP2 this increased by 55% and for ZP3 by 33%.\nThe results from the MIC and MBC tests, representing the antimicrobial activity of the nanomaterials dispersed in batch cultures, are summarized in Table 4. By measuring the effect of decreasing concentrations of nanomaterials on S. aureus bacteria growth over 24 h, the MICs were found to be 6.25 \u00b5g/mL (ZP1), 1.5 \u00b5g/mL (ZP2), and 3.25 \u00b5g/mL (ZP3), which are lower concentration values compared to those of the same nanoparticles against P. aeruginosa (12.5 \u00b5g/mL, 3.25 \u00b5g/mL, and 6.25 \u00b5g/mL, respectively). Similarly, the MBC for nanomaterials against S. aureus was found to be 6.25 \u00b5g/mL (ZP1), 3.75 \u00b5g/mL (ZP2), and 6.25 \u00b5g/mL (ZP3), being lower in each case compared to the registered results against P. aeruginosa bacteria (25 \u00b5g/mL (ZP1), 6.25 \u00b5g/mL (ZP2), and 12.5 \u00b5g/mL (ZP3)). The results indicated that S. aureus (Gram-positive) planktonic cells were more susceptible to citrate-functionalized ZnO, ZnO/Au, and ZnO/Ag than P. aeruginosa (Gram-negative). The difference in susceptibility may be attributed to variations in the cell surface characteristics between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus bacteria, in particular the bacterial cell membrane [48]. Gram-negative bacteria have a periplasmic space that may act as a barrier for the nanoparticles. Also, Gram-negative bacteria produce more proteins that bind to the surface of ZnO NPs, making the interaction between the NPs and bacteria more difficult. Furthermore, Gram-negative bacteria exhibit an overexpression of efflux pumps and porins, which may limit the penetration of nanoparticles into the cell. In the case of P. aeruginosa, it has been observed that the bacterium produces a pigment called pyocyanin, which serves as a defense mechanism against nanoparticles [49,50]. Pyocyanin can interact with the ions produced or released by ZnO NPs or AgNPs, thereby neutralizing their antimicrobial effects. These factors contribute to the higher susceptibility of Gram-positive S. aureus cells to ZnO NPs compared to Gram-negative P. aeruginosa cells.\nThe proposed mechanism of antimicrobial action is complex, including the release of cations and direct interaction with the cell wall through electrostatic interactions, synergistically with the oxidative damage caused by ROS generation. The release of cations from the nanoparticles is thought to be one of the mechanisms of antimicrobial action in the absence of light. The interactions between cations and the bacterial membrane are facilitated by the negatively charged molecules composing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell walls. As a result, NPs are electrostatically attracted to the surface of bacteria, disrupting their cell walls and increasing their permeability. The dissimilarity in antimicrobial activity of nanocomposites may be due to the distinct properties of silver and gold; silver has a higher reactivity, while gold is known for its chemical stability and corrosion resistance [49]. Nanoparticles that came into contact with microbes interact with the bacterial cell membrane and start to intervene in the basic processes of the cells. Among the results of nanoparticle actions, the most important are the damage of the bacterial cell membrane, cellular fluid leakage, DNA and protein disruption, and enzyme deactivation [51]. This interaction with bacteria is dependent on the chemical nature of the nanoparticles. Silver and gold have a strong affinity for different chemical groups from the cell, particularly to SH groups. Ag ions have been proven to block the respiratory chain, inhibiting respiratory enzymes [21], and to disturb the replication of DNA, without inducing resistance to silver ions, although some studies have shown a few exceptions [52]. Compared to silver and ZnO, AuNPs have not been as extensively explored for their antibacterial properties, but now have become a hot research topic [53]. Small gold nanoparticles can perforate the bacterial cell membrane, which results in cell death [54], or can cause depolarization of the membrane potential and DNA damage, causing apoptotic-like death [55]. From the literature, ZnO-based nanoparticles, doped or in conjugation with noble metals, have demonstrated effective antibacterial activity through the formation of ROS (especially OH and singlet oxygen radicals [56]) and the releasing of Zn2+ [57], responsible for the cellular damage. Furthermore, the citrate groups present in each synthesized nanomaterial contribute to the overall antimicrobial effect [24].\n\n## 2.4. Photocatalytic Activity\nThe photocatalytic activities of the citrate\u2013ZnO, ZnO/Au, and ZnO/Ag nanocomposites were assessed by the degradation of MB under UV irradiation. Figure 6a shows the absorption spectra of the aqueous solution of MB with 40 mg ZnO, ZnO/Au, and ZnO/Ag nano-photocatalysts. In the absence of ZP samples, the concentration of MB decreased by only 1.14% under UV irradiation (Figure 6b). When using ZP1 as a photocatalyst, the concentration of MB decreased over the irradiation time, which can be attributed to nanometric dimensions. In the case of the nanocomposite photocatalysts, the MB degradation capability was increased in comparison with that caused by bare ZnO NPs, proving that the presence of AuNPs or AgNPs had a positive effect on the photocatalytic performance. According to the experimental results, the calculated photocatalytic degradation efficiencies were 94.85% (ZP2) and 97.80% (ZP3), while ZP1 achieved 83.12% (Figure 6b). The degradation rate of MB was higher in the case of the nanocomposites compared to ZP1, proven by the higher slope of the ZP2 and ZP3 curves in Figure 6b. The increased photocatalytic effectiveness of the ZnO/Au and ZnO/Ag nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergetic effect of the nanocomposite\u2019s constituents and the specific charge transfer upon constituent contact. The strong electronic interaction between AuNPs and ZnO, and between AgNPs and ZnO, respectively, facilitated the charge transfer from ZnO to the noble metal nanoparticles, leading to better charge separation of the photogenerated electron\u2013hole pairs. The presence of noble metals in ZnO-based nanocomposites can result in a decrease in work functions, leading to an increase in the electron transfer rate and a faster rate of dye degradation [32]. In photocatalysis, the charge carriers that have escaped annihilation migrate to the surface of the catalyst and initiate reactions with the surface-adsorbed species. The holes react with H2O molecules, producing hydroxyl radicals, whereas the electrons react with dissolved oxygen, resulting in superoxide radicals or hydroperoxide radicals. All these species contribute to the degradation of methylene blue dye [58].\nThe photocatalytic efficiency of ZnO/Ag being a little higher than that of ZnO/Ag was in concordance with the values of the band gaps (Figure 4b). Other authors obtained a better improvement in the removal of Congo red dye under UV light irradiation when AuNPs were deposited onto ZnO compared to AgNP deposition [29]. Fageria et al. [44] found that Au-decorated ZnO exhibited better photocatalytic efficiency in comparison with ZnO/Ag, this result being on account of the greater work function value of gold compared to that of silver.\n\n## 3.1. Reagents\nZnO nanoparticles (<100 nm) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Au (III) chloride trihydrate HAuCl4\u22193H2O (99%), silver nitrate AgNO3 (99.999%), sodium citrate C6H5Na3O7 (99.0%), and Mueller\u2013Hinton Agar were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany) and used without further purification.\n\n## 3.2. Preparation of ZnO/Au and ZnO/Ag Nanocomposites\nDuring nanocomposite synthesis, commercial ZnO NPs were firstly functionalized with citrate, and then nanoparticles of Au or Ag were synthesized in the presence of the citrate-functionalized ZnO NPs. Then, 500 mg of commercial ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in 100 mL of deionized water at room temperature using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. In this dispersion, sodium citrate powder (0.7 mM) was added and maintained for 24 h under magnetic stirring. Precursor powder of HAuCl4 or AgNO3 was added into the mixture followed by magnetic stirring for 2 h in the dark. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, washed with deionized water 4 times, and dried in an oven at 70 \u00b0C. The obtained ZnO/Au powder had a faint purple color while ZnO/Ag was light yellow. For comparison, ZnO NPs functionalized with citrate were washed and dried. The samples were coded according to Table 1.\n\n## 3.3. Characterization Techniques\nX-ray diffraction investigations were performed using a 9 kW Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer (\u03bbCuK\u03b11 = 0.154 nm) in parallel-beam configuration. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) investigations were performed in \u03b8/2\u03b8 mode. The morphological features of samples were studied using a Quanta Inspect F scanning electron microscope (FEI Company), and their chemical composition by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). A Fourier Bruker Optics Tensor 27 spectrometer was used to perform transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to study the chemical bond configuration by averaging 64 scans with a resolution of 4 cm\u22121, at room temperature, using the potassium bromide pellet method. The sizing of the ZnO nanoparticles and synthesized composite powders was performed using ImageJ software1.8.0. The amounts of Au and Ag in the synthesized nanocomposites were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using an Optima 5300 DV (Perkin ElmerInc., Waltham, MA, USA). The optical absorbance spectra of the powders were recorded at room temperature using a Cary 5000 spectrophotometer (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded from 200 to 700 nm in 1 nm intervals. All spectra were baseline-corrected with a 100% R baseline collected over the same spectral domain using a white polytetrafluoroethylene standard sample. The band gap energy, Eg, was estimated from the Kubelka\u2013Munk function F(R) defined by Equation (4):K/S = (1 \u2212 R)2/2R(4)\nwhere K and S are the K-M absorption and scattering coefficients, an",
