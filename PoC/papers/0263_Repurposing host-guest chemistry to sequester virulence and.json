  "full_text": "## Introduction\nThe scope of current antibiotic targets is very limited, with the vast majority of approved treatments targeting either DNA synthesis, protein synthesis, membrane integrity or cell-wall biosynthesis, all of which are counteracted by numerous and increasingly prevalent resistance mechanisms. The ensuing imminent global health crisis has been documented from several perspectives in recent reportings1\u20133 and has prompted the World Health Organization to create a priority pathogen list. Gram-negative bacteria, which have an outer membrane (OM) that acts as a formidable barrier against a large number of standard-of-care antibiotics, represent the majority of pathogens on the priority list4, with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa featuring at the top5. This pressing global challenge emphasises the need for the discovery of therapies with unique molecular scaffolds and/or mechanisms of action that evade existing resistance mechanisms and are less likely to lead to drug resistance6.\nA promising alternative to the limited antibiotic scope is the targeting of bacterial virulence factors, which play a crucial role in the establishment and progression of infections6. Potential targets have included pore-forming toxins7, homoserine lactone signalling molecules8\u201310, bacterial biofilms11,12, metal chelation13 and the bacterial OM14. Macrocyclic cavity-containing molecules are intensively explored in host-guest chemistry by supramolecular chemists, due to their tunable molecular preferences. Specifically, varying steric and conformational preferences enable the differential encapsulation of specific guests within their inner cavities15. The core structure can also be readily modified or enhanced with functional groups to add secondary functionalities16, with several examples emerging of simultaneous interactions taking place17,18. Recent efforts have also explored the application of functionalized macrocycles towards antibacterial therapies, for both Gram-positive19 and Gram-negative20 pathogens, including biofilm targeting compounds21. However, the relationship between structure, function, and mechanism of action remains poorly understood.\nHomoserine lactones (HSLs) are small diffusible signal molecules produced, released, and sensed by Gram-negative bacteria in a process called quorum sensing (QS) and are used to coordinate colony-wide responses including biofilm formation, production of exotoxins and surfactants, motility, and nutrient scavenging molecules22,23. As such, they form an attractive target for, and have previously been explored as, anti-virulence strategies24,25. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) form a major component of the outer leaflet of the OM in gram-negative bacteria, posing as a formidable barrier against intracellular antibiotics26.\nIn this work, we explore the interactions between the synthetic macrocycle Pillar[5]arene (P[5]a) and two distinct virulence factors: HSLs and LPS. We investigate the interaction between P[5]a and HSLs and how this shuts down virulence-controlled responses in bacterial pathogens. Similarly, we study the interactions between P[5]a and LPS and how this affects the function of LPS in the outer membrane, resulting in increased penetration of antibiotics across the OM barrier. Collectively, we investigate how P[5]a suppresses bacterial virulence in extensively drug resistant isolates and observe that in the absence of virulence factors, viability of lung epithelial cells recovers dramatically. The combined interactions of P[5]a with bacterial virulence factors provide a promising strategy against antibiotic-resistant infections, either alone or in combination with standard-of-care antibiotics.\n\n## Antivirulence screen for macrocycle-HSL host-guest interactions\nTo identify possible host-guest interactions between cavity-containing macrocycles and bacterial signalling molecules, we set up an unconventional screening of a set of macrocycles (Supplementary Table\u00a01) for affinity to six different HSLs (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Although previous efforts already established a link between size of the internal cavity and binding affinity9, little is known related to the affinities, preferences and determinants of host-guest interactions with HSLs. To gain a better understanding, and assuming that their cavity size plays an important role in determining HSL affinity, widely varying types of macrocycles were selected, primarily to represent a diverse range of inner cavity sizes (1.5 \u2013 11.7\u2009\u00c5) and molecular weights (172 \u2013 2.260\u2009g/mol). Similarly, HSLs were selected to represent diversity in their acyl chains, including a branched carbon, carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups. We also screened for binding to pC HSL, containing a terminal para-phenol.Fig. 1Host-guest interactions between macrocycles and bacterial homoserine lactones selective for HSLs with prolonged acyl chains.a Schematic of the interaction between macrocyclic \u201chosts\u201d with HSL \u201cguests\u201d. b The molecular structures, abbreviated names and bacterial species of all QS HSLs used in this study. c Schematic representation of HSL quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria (left), along with a virulence inhibition approach (right). In short, HSLs produced by select individuals diffuse freely through the outer and inner membranes and get sensed by intracellular receptor proteins in other community members, promoting the production of isogenic HSL and a synchronized regulation of activities. Applied virulence inhibition strategy, where the interaction between the HSLs and macrocyclic host prevents the recognition of HSLs by its cognate receptor. d Screening for the interaction between HSLs as seen in (b) and a set of macrocycles reveals several combinations where the macrocycle interacts with the HSL and where the growth rate in E. coli (I1/I0 OD600) remains mostly unaffected (threshold, grey dashed lines, \u00b120%). The interaction is detected through a HSL biosensor, where the cognate receptor is expressed, and the promotor binding region is fused to GFP. Interactions between macrocycles and HSLs are observed through a decrease in affinity (I1/I0). e Concentration-dependent effects of the strongest interacting macrocycle, P[5]a, on the fluorescent expression in E. coli for each of the six HSLs, indicates increased affinity towards HSLs with longer acyl chains. The data represent average values of biological replicates \u00b1 s.d (n\u2009=\u20093 per group). f Effect of P[5]a on the growth rate and viability of E. coli. E. coli incubated with highest tested concentration of P[5]a, 2.5\u2009mM, shows a standard growth curve, including lag, log and stationary phase. A BacLight bacterial viability assessment shows cell viability in all tested concentrations of P[5]a after 24\u2009h of exposure and no concentration-dependent cell death. The data represent average values of biological replicates \u00b1 s.d (n\u2009=\u20093 per group).\nFor the screening, we developed a fluorescent E. coli reporter system capable of detecting the six different HSLs. Each receptor dimerizes and binds to the promoter linked to EGFP upon addition of its cognate HSL (Fig.\u00a01c, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01, Supplementary Table\u00a02). We screened for macrocyclic virulence inhibitors with a strong signal ratio for each of the HSLs (I1/I0 fluorescence) and minimal effects on bacterial viability and growth rate (I1/I0 optical density, \u00b1 20%, grey dashed lines). We identified several macrocycle-HSL combinations of interest with a fluorescence signal ratio over 50% and minimal effects on growth rate, highlighted in blue circles (Fig.\u00a01d, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a-e). All host-guest combinations with increased binding, fall within a limited range of inner cavity sizes, from 3\u2009\u00c5 for 4-sulfocalix[4]arene (4-Sc[4]a) to 7.8\u2009\u00c5 for \u03b2-Cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), suggesting that the inner cavity plays a role in the binding. Among the macrocycles tested, P[5]a showed the highest concentration-dependant signal ratio. Even though P[5]a shows binding with all six HSLs, it ranges from almost no binding to the C4 HSL (18%), with a very short acyl chain, to strong binding to the 3-oxo-C12 (64%) and 3:OH:C14 HSL (96%), both with prolonged acyl chains (Fig.\u00a01e).\nP[5]a had no observable effect on growth rate in E. coli and a viability assessment after 24\u2009h growth shows that all concentrations tested (up to 2.5\u2009mM), were well tolerated (Fig.\u00a01f, Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a-e). Looking more closely at the structure of P[5]a (Fig.\u00a02a), shows that it is a modified pillar[5]arene with a lipophilic core and a hydrophilic periphery. It contains a cavity which is hydrophobic (4.6\u2009\u00c5), and a symmetrically substituted polycationic rim. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis show that in a combined microbial community, consisting of four E. coli sensor strains each with a unique fluorescent protein that detects a different HSL, P[5]a selectively binds the 3-OH-C14:1 HSL with an elongated acyl chain, resulting in a 102 reduction in fluorescence of the pCin-EGFP sensor strain (Fig.\u00a02b-d). In contrast, expression of the other three sensor strains remained largely unaffected by the addition of P[5]a, suggesting that the host-guest interactions could be utilized for specific targeting of bacteria with longer acyl chains. The selectivity, we propose, can be a beneficial approach, to target pathogens more specifically in comparison to broad-spectrum antibiotic activity. In various environments, such as the human microbiome, a diverse microbial gut community is essential for the health of its host. Antibiotic treatment can have a detrimental impact on the microbiome diversity, deteriorating the overall health of the host, while also leaving them far more vulnerable to Clostridium difficile infections.Fig. 2P[5]a selective for prolonged acyl HSLs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, resulting in an inhibition of biofilm and toxins.a Chemical structure of the synthetic host P[5]a which demonstrated the strongest interaction with HSLs with longer acyl chains, highlighting the hydrophobic core cavity (brown box), flanked on both sides by the polycationic hydrophilic residues (orange boxes). b Schematic of a combined microbial community, where P[5]a specifically inhibits strains utilizing HSLs with longer acyl chains for communication and synchronization, as seen in (c) and (d). c Fluorescence microscopy images of a combined microbial community of E. coli cells consisting of four different strains with a unique fluorescent protein (pRhl-mKO2 orange for C4, pLux-CFP cyan for 3-oxo-C6, pCin-GFP green for 3-OH-C14:1 and pRpa-mCherry red for pC HSL) that each detect a different HSL, demonstrate that P[5]a specifically and preferentially interacts with HSLs that contain longer acyl chains. The addition of P[5]a results in the inhibition of the pCin-GFP, sensing the long chain 3-OH-C14:1 HSL.

Data represent average values of biological replicates \u00b1 s.d (n\u2009=\u20093 per group).\n\n## P[5]a inhibits QS-associated virulence in carbapenem-resistant \nTo understand the possible implications of the host-guest interactions between the macrocycles and HSLs in a biological context, we continued the validation against the clinically relevant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, which both deploy long-chain HSLs (Fig.\u00a02b). Extensive previous work on these pathogens has elucidated the function of HSLs in QS, an essential regulatory mechanism of collective virulence in these pathogens27\u201329. We screened the macrocycles that displayed the highest affinity, (i.e. P[5]a, \u03b1-cyclodextrin (\u03b1-CD), \u03b2-CD, and 4-Sc[4]a), for their effects on the production of pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa isolate PAO1. Pyocyanin is an exotoxin with an observable strong green color that is under direct regulation of QS, used as a surrogate measure of virulence (Fig.\u00a02e). The addition of P[5]a resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in pyocyanin levels, starting with concentrations of P[5]a as low as 10\u2009\u00b5M, with complete suppression at 1\u2009mM and above. In contrast, macrocycles \u03b1-CD, \u03b2-CD and 4-Sc[4]a had no effect on pyocyanin levels (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a-c). The incubation of macrocycles with purified pyocyanin confirms that P[5]a inhibits the production of pyocyanin rather than interacting with existing toxin molecules (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d). The concentration-dependent effects of P[5]a on pyocyanin production in PAO1 strongly correlates with the effects of P[5]a on the quorum sensing biosensor in E. coli (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03e).\nP[5]a had comparable effects on biofilm formation in PAO1, also strongly associated with HSL-regulated QS, as indicated by the purple stain (crystal violet), with a similar concentration dependency as observed in the pyocyanin assessment (Fig.\u00a02f). Because of the increasing pressure of resistance on antibiotic therapy, we tested the effectivity against top priority carbapenem- and third/fourth-generation cephalosporin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates (Fig.\u00a02g, h, and Supplementary Data\u00a01). In all cases, we observed a statistically significant decrease in biofilm formation. The effectivity of P[5]a against strains P. aeruginosa 2798 and A. baumannii 5542, 5707 and 5568 (Fig.\u00a02g, h) is of particular importance, as these \u201csuperbug\u201d pathogens are resistant to nearly all clinical treatments (Supplementary Data\u00a01).\n\n## P[5]a binds prolonged acyl chain HSLs inside its inner cavity\nIn order to confirm that the observed virulence inhibition-responses are a result of the interactions between P[5]a and the HSLs within the core cavity, and to clarify the observed preferences for long-branched HSLs, we utilized a dye displacement assay (Fig.\u00a03a)30. The binding of methylene orange (MO) to P[5]a results in a shift of the absorption maximum from 470\u2009nm to 392\u2009nm, as reported (Fig.\u00a03b, left)18,31 Subsequent addition of HSLs releases the MO by competitive binding (Fig.\u00a03b, right). The resulting recovery of MO absorption at 470\u2009nm allows to determine the binding affinity of HSL-P[5]a (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a-c).Fig. 3Binding of HSLs occurs inside the cavity of the P[5]a macrocycle, with length of the prolonged acyl chain of the HSL playing a key role in the strength of the interaction.a Schematic representation of the dye-displacement assay, showing the targeted P[5]a-HSL interaction (k1), the P[5]a-MO complex formation (k2) and the measured dye displacement assay (k3). b Left: shift in absorption spectra of MO (2.0\u2009\u00b5M) titrated with increasing amounts of P[5]a (i.e. k2). Right: the titration of increasing amounts of 3-oxo-C12 HSL, displaces the MO inside the cavity of P[5]a, resulting in a recovery of the absorption spectrum, (i.e. k3). c Measured optical density at 470\u2009nm of P[5]a-MO complexes (P[5]a concentration = 10\u2009\u00b5M, MO concentration = 2.0\u2009\u00b5M, NaCl concentration=50\u2009mM), titrated against increasing concentrations of the corresponding HSL (dots). The data represent average values \u00b1 s.d (n\u2009=\u20093 biologically independent samples per group). d Left: absorption spectra of MO (2.0\u2009\u03bcM) titrated with increasing amounts of P[5]a (k2) in 0 and 50\u2009mM of NaCl. Right: absorption spectra of the P[5]a-MO complex titrated with the HSLs 3-oxo-C8 and 3-oxo-C12 (k3) in 0 and 50\u2009mM of NaCl. The data represent average values \u00b1 s.d (n\u2009=\u20093 biologically independent samples per group). Arrows indicate the P[5]a/MO ratio selected for each HSL titration (1:1 and 5:1, respectively). e NMR spectra (D2O/[D6]DMSO 30 % at 310\u2009K) of P[5]a, the HSLs 3-OH-C14:1, 3-Oxo-C12, 3-Oxo-C6 and C4, and P[5]a combined with each HSL. f The electron density of the combined surface of P[5]a complexed with 3-OH-C14:1, 3-Oxo-C12, and 3-Oxo-C6 HSLs. g Hydrophobic/philic maps highlight the shape and extent of hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces of P[5]a in isolation, as well as in 3-OH-C14:1, 3-Oxo-C12 and 3-Oxo-C6. h Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) against KEGG and GO gene sets, performed on sequenced mRNA of PAO1 treated with P[5]a. i Localization of mRNA products. Number of mRNA products per localization group ranges from cytoplasm to periplasm 27, 93, 17, 16, 16 and 12 respectively. Box plots show the median (centre line), the upper and lower quantiles (box), and the range of the data (whiskers).\nThe dissociation constant (kD) between P[5]a and the HSLs was determined, allowing us to rank the binding affinity of HSLs into the P[5]a cavity (3OH-C14:1\u2009\u2265\u20093-oxo-C12\u2009>\u20093-oxo-C8\u00bb3-oxo-C6~pC~C4) (Fig.\u00a03c, Table\u00a01, Supplementary Fig.\u00a05). This is in agreement with the hydrophobicity decrease expected from the decrease in acyl chain length, as observed in Fig.\u00a01e. The addition of NaCl affected the association constants between MO and P[5]a, whereas the dissociation constants between P[5]a and the HSLs remained unaffected (Fig.\u00a03c, Table\u00a01, Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c). This suggests that electrostatic interactions do not influence the binding of guests inside the core cavity.Table 1Binding affinities for host-guest interactions between the macrocycle P[5]a and HSLs, determined through dye displacement with the MO indicatorHSLkD (M) in 0\u2009mM NaClkD (M) in 50\u2009mM NaClk\u22121 MO-P[5]a(0.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08) nM(9.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06) \u00b5Mk\u22122 3-OH-C14:1 (Cin)(2.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20) \u00b5M a(2.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07) \u00b5M (a)k\u22122 3-oxo-C12 (Las)(1.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05) \u00b5M(5.90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02) \u00b5Mk\u22122 3-oxo-C8 (Tra)(18.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.60) \u00b5M(0.12 1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02) mMk\u22122 3-oxo-C6 (Lux)(0.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04) mM(1.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03) mMk\u22122 pC (Rpa)(0.65\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05) mM(4.36\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09) mMk\u22122 C4 (Rhl)(15.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.60) mM\u2013 ba3OH-C14:1 dataset is limited due to strong scattering. bSignal increase is insignificant to be fitted\nTo better understand which chemical interactions are involved and how structural features influence binding preferences, we used NMR (Fig.\u00a03e). The 1H NMR results confirm the stronger interaction with the longer 3-Oxo-C12 and 3-OH-C14:1 HSLs, hence confirming complexation. Minimal changes were observed in C4 and pC HSLs in the presence of P[5]a, suggesting weak to no interaction (Fig.\u00a03e, Supplementary Fig.\u00a06).\nWe used density functional theory modelling (M06-2X)32 to visualize the HSL-P[5]a interaction (Fig.\u00a03f). The total binding surface areas were generally proportional to affinity. The large difference in alkyl chain volume between 3-oxo-C12 and 3-Oxo-C6 (70.5 vs 6.3\u2009\u00c5) correlated with their relative affinity. The 3-Oxo-C12 long hydrophobic chain resides in P[5]a\u2019s internal cavity, making this the most stable complex (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07a, b). Furthermore, these HSL showed little to no disruption of the preferred geometry or electronics of the host cavity, highlighting the complementarity (Fig.\u00a03g, Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). Notably, the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl or absence of functional groups did not have an impactful effect on the binding affinities, apart from affecting the length of the acyl chain. This further indicates that binding affinities are largely determined by length and hydrophobicity of the acyl chain length.\n\n## mRNA analysis reveals QS target and interplay of effects OM and extracellular space\nNext we analysed the differential transcription of total mRNA in P[5]a treated and untreated PAO1 to gain more insight into the mode of action (Fig.\u00a03h). Gene set enrichment using Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) terms revealed strong down-regulation of virulence-associated factors, including biofilm formation, QS and pyoverdine biosynthesis. Localization of the protein products shows the largest downregulation in products targeted to the extracellular space and OM vesicles, both of which are strongly associated with virulent factors in P. aeruginosa, including LPS, exotoxins, proteases and elastases, and essential components in the early stages of infections and their progression (Fig.\u00a03i)33. We also observed up-regulation in two-component systems, integral membrane components and membrane gene sets, indicating an interplay of effects caused by P[5]a at the OM surface. This is in line with previous characterizations of cationic compounds and peptides, where the positively charged residues are speculated to interact with negatively charged lipids34,35.\n\n## LPS sequestration is driven by electrostatic interactions\nGiven the effects of P[5]a on the bacterial membrane (Fig.\u00a03h, i) and its net positive charge, we hypothesized a possible interaction with LPS. LPS is a key component in the bacterial OM whose phosphate groups contribute to the overall negative charge of the membrane surface. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) shows that the titration of purified LPS with increasing concentrations of P[5]a in water results in the formation of larger complexes, starting at 15\u2009\u00b5M and plateauing at 40\u2009\u00b5M (Fig.\u00a04a). The titration of these complexes in water with NaCl reverses and breaks up the larger complexes, confirming that surface charge interactions are a driving force in the complexation (Fig.\u00a04b, c)36. However, since most physiological conditions occur in relative high levels of salt, which hinders surface charge interactions, we explored the titration of LPS with P[5]a in physiological salt buffers 0.5x and 1x PBS. Starting at 50\u2009\u00b5M in 0.5x and 1x PBS, we observed a continuous increase in the presence of large complexes. We further studied the P[5]a-LPS interaction in high salt (1x PBS) environments using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), to better understand the formed complexes (Fig.\u00a04d). P[5]a and LPS separately required high rotational speeds of 60,000 RPM to achieve detectable sedimentation. P[5]a-LPS mixtures resulted in rapid sedimentation at rates as low as 25,000 RPM, suggesting the formation of larger complexes/aggregates (Supplementary Fig.\u00a09a\u2013c). P[5]a-LPS mixtures showed noticeable differences in the sedimentation speed of these complexes, as observed from the sedimentation coefficient range of 3\u2013100\u2009S. This range corresponds to molecular weights ranging from 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 up to 1 \u00d7 106\u2009Da.Fig. 4P[5]a interacts with LPS in the bacterial OM, enhancing the penetration and potency of co-administered antibiotics.a P[5]a titrated into 0.1\u2009mg/ml PA10 LPS (5-10\u2009\u00b5M) solution in water with DLS shows the formation and assembly of large complexes starting at 15\u2009\u00b5M of P[5]a. The data represent average values \u00b1 s.d (n\u2009=\u20093 independent experiments per group). Expansion highlights the formation of P[5]a-LPS complexes in 0.5x and 1x physiological conditions. b The interaction and aggregation observed in (a) is reversible by the addition of salt (NaCl), which leads to the dissociation of the larger complexes.

Expansion highlights that a majority of the LPS, 91%, is present in the larger P[5]a-LPS complexes (n\u2009=\u20091 independent experiment per group). e P[5]a enhances the efficacy of co-administered antibiotics amikacin, cefepime, ceftazidime, and meropenem in six MDR resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. MIC values according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI):37 susceptible (below yellow line), intermediate susceptible (between yellow and red line), and resistant (above red line). f\u2013i Serial passaging of PAO1 with the antibiotics aztreonam (f), cefepime (g), meropenem (h), and tobramycin (i) as well as co-administration of the antibiotics with P[5]a. Co-administrations greatly slowed the development of resistance of PAO1 to the respective antibiotic treatment. Cefepime reached 128\u2009\u00b5g/ml after four days, which was the highest concentration of antibiotic included. j The average time (d) for PAO1 to double the MIC value required to kill the pathogen, as seen in (f\u2013i) in both a stand-alone and combinatory treatment shows that co-administrations reduce the resistance doubling time. k Schematic representation of LPS positioned in the OM (left). P[5]a interacts with LPS in the OM, likely affecting the tight organization of the OM, which improves the effectivity of antibiotics with intracellular targets in a combined administration.\n\n## P[5]a enhances the penetration of the OM of intracellular antibiotics\nIn order to explore whether the observed complexation with LPS affects its function in the outer membrane, we examined clinical isolates with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics (Supplementary Data\u00a01). We co-administered P[5]a with four standard-of-care antibiotics with intracellular targets i.e. amikacin, cefepime, ceftazidime, and meropenem (Fig.\u00a04e). In all combinations with P[5]a, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for the clinical isolates were reduced compared to the antibiotic treatment alone. The stronger reductions were not specific to a clinical isolate strain or type of antibiotic, indicating that the membrane interference enhances the penetration of all antibiotics with intracellular targets. This observation is in line with other OM-sensitizers34,38.\nWe then studied the build-up of resistance in PAO1 towards antibiotic therapy over a 14-day period. Whereas in stand-alone antibiotic therapies of aztreonam, cefepime, meropenem and tobramycin (Fig.\u00a04f-i), in all administrations encountered resistance, in the combined administration, no antibiotic encountered resistance. Aztreonam, cefepime and tobramycin remained fully susceptible, whereas meropenem reached intermediate susceptible. The average time for resistance levels to double was greatly increased (Fig.\u00a04j). Collectively, these results emphasize the potential of P[5]a to revitalize available antibiotic therapies and reduce resistant encounters (Fig.\u00a04k).\nIsolates from acute infections often produce elevated levels of endotoxins, proteases, siderophores and demonstrate increased motility39. In contrast, isolates from chronic infections often prioritize a mucoid phenotype, lowered doubling times and increased biofilm production levels. Added to this variation is a plethora of increasingly prevalent resistance mechanisms. Together, these traits have increased the threshold for novel treatments significantly40. Consequently, we tested the effectivity of P[5]a against a large subset of 72\u2009P. aeruginosa isolates, consisting of International Antigenic Scheme (IATS) serotype collection (19 isolates), a CF chronic collection (20 isolates) and a set of multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical isolates with ranging antibiotic resistance profiles (33 isolates) (Fig.\u00a05a, Supplementary Data\u00a01). P[5]a showed widespread activity, reducing biofilm levels in over 96%, with over 92% significance. However, in one isolate, the biofilm production was significantly upregulated. We did not observe differences in the effects of P[5]a on different P. aeruginosa collections, bacterial phenotype, antibiotic resistance profile or site of isolation. Of note, P[5]a also proved effective against \u0394LasR mutants (+), which have lost the ability to sense the 3-oxo-C12 HSL, which is particularly prevalent in P. aeruginosa strains isolated from chronic CF infections41. Ranking the documented resistant antibiotic profiles (supplementary Table\u00a01) against the function of P[5]a (Fig.\u00a05b), shows that P[5]a remains effective against, and evades, most antibiotic resistance mechanisms.Fig. 5P[5]a enhances the penetration of co-administered antibiotics.a Effect of P[5]a on biofilm inhibition after a 24\u2009h static culture formation in a panel of P. aeruginosa isolates, consisting of P. aeruginosa IATS serotypes, a set of isolates from cystic fibrosis patients suffering from chronic infections, and a set of MDR clinical isolates, derived from various sites of infection.

The data represent average values of biological replicates \u00b1 s.d (n\u2009=\u20093 per group). b Effect of P[5]a on biofilm inhibition in marked resistant clinical isolates of panel seen in (a). P[5]a successfully inhibited biofilms in resistant isolates, independent of the type or mechanism of action of the antibiotic. The colours of the antibiotics correspond to the antibiotic class. Only isolates marked as resistant respective to antibiotic treatment were included. Number of resistant isolates per type of antibiotic ranges from Piperacillin-tazobactam to Ciprofloxacin 7, 12, 35, 15, 13, 9, 35, 8, 9, 12, 12 and 11 respectively. Box plots show the median (centre line), the upper and lower quantiles (box), and the range of the data (whiskers). c) Effect of P[5]a on pyocyanin toxin suppression over a 14 day period. P[5]a successfully suppressed toxin levels throughout the 14 days, with no observable decrease in effectivity.
