  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance is currently considered one of the principal threats to global public health by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1], especially because of the global spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens. MDR pathogens can develop resistance to different antimicrobials via horizontal gene transfer and via gene mutations as a consequence of exposure to these drugs. Although the acquisition of resistance is a natural process, it is exacerbated by the misuse of antibiotics, inadequate surveillance, and the poorly controlled regulation of antibiotics in clinical medicine and in the livestock industry, which led to the appearance and spread of MDR bacteria all over the world [1,2,3].\nMortality caused by resistance to antibiotics is a major health problem, causing more than 23,000 deaths a year in the United States (US) alone (Center for Disease Control, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 (2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report)) and more than 33,000 in Europe [4]. Already alarming, the number of deaths is predicted to increase worldwide to more than 10 million by 2050, although predictions are difficult to make in this field [5,6].\nIn 2008, Rice and colleagues first referred to the six most frequent MDR bacterial pathogens, i.e., Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., as the \u201cESKAPE\u201d pathogens [7]. Some other opportunistic pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Burkholderia cepacia can also become MDR strains and are able to cause severe infections.\nBacteria can evade the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics via three different but related mechanisms: resistance, tolerance, and persistence [8]. Resistance is the ability of bacteria to grow in the presence of high concentrations of an antibiotic and is caused by inherited mutations, which affect the efflux pumps, the drug target, or the antibiotic molecule itself [8,9]. Resistant populations can be found in all types of environments: water, animals, inanimate surfaces, humans, plants, and food [10,11,12,13]. Moreover, resistant bacteria can grow under antibiotic pressure, their resistant phenotype is inheritable, and a significant increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics is required to effectively kill them [14].\nHowever, resistance phenotypes are not always due to the acquisition of resistance genes or mutations in the bacterial genome, and they can often explained by the appearance of a persistent phenotype, which includes tolerant populations of bacteria and/or the presence of persistent sub-populations (known as \u201cpersister cells\u201d or \u201cpersisters\u201d) within a population of susceptible cells (i.e., killed by an antibiotic at a concentration equal to or lower than the MIC). Bacteria exhibiting this persistent phenotype are able to overcome antibiotic treatment but do not affect the MICs of the drugs. As with resistance, tolerance and persistence were first observed shortly after the introduction of penicillin, as reviewed very recently by Windels and colleagues [15]. Antibiotics then become ineffective owing to the lack of cellular metabolism and to the effect on or interference in DNA replication, transcription, and translation, as well as cell-wall synthesis. \u201cPersisters\u201d are non-growing, metabolically inactive, dormant bacteria that exhibit transient high levels of tolerance to antibiotics and play a non-negligible role in chronic or recurrent infections [14], as they can survive both antibiotic therapy and host immune responses. The dormant bacteria can rapidly revert to the wild-type (WT) phenotype and regain their antibiotic susceptibility when drug pressure is removed and their metabolic activity is reactivated. The signaling pathways involved in this \u201cawaking\u201d process are being further investigated [16,17]. Persister cells can survive in immune-compromised patients but also in patients in whom antibiotics do not effectively kill pathogenic bacteria via immune-evasion strategies [16]. There is currently strong evidence suggesting that the ability of bacteria to live inside some cells (such as macrophages) and the formation of biofilms are both associated with persistent infections [18]. Furthermore, clinical isolates from chronic infections caused by Candida albicans [19], P. aeruginosa [20], or uropathogenic E. coli [21] exposed to antibiotic pressure during a long period of time are also associated with persistent infections, exhibiting increased persister levels relative to isolates from acute or early-stage infections.\nThe presence of persisters in common bacterial infections is reported in patients and linked to relapses of infection. Mulcahy and colleagues isolated clinical strains of P. aeruginosa from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and observed increasing persister levels during antibiotic treatment [20]. Schumacher and colleagues showed that high-persister hipA mutations in E. coli were selected in recurrent urinary infections over time and also observed the importance of the hipA7 mutation in persister formation in vitro [22].\nTolerant bacteria also exhibit an antibiotic-resistant phenotype. Tolerance is defined as the ability to survive transient exposure to high concentrations of antibiotics, and it can be inherited or not [9]. Unlike persistent subpopulations, tolerant bacteria are metabolically active, although their vital processes were shown to slow down [23].\nBoth tolerant and persistent cells are currently underestimated by the scientific community, despite evidence showing that they promote the evolution of resistance in bacteria. As early as 1988, Moreillon and Tomasz demonstrated that cyclic exposure of pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae) to high concentrations of penicillin selects for tolerant mutants, while resistant mutants evolve during exposure to low (but sustained) concentrations of penicillin [24]. One decade later, Novak and colleagues established that clinical isolates of vancomycin-tolerant pneumococcus had mutations in the vncS gene and that streptomycin- or penicillin-tolerant S. pneumoniae mutant showed greater efficiency in transformation with DNA compared to a WT S. pneumoniae strain [25]. This finding consolidated the idea of tolerant bacteria facilitating the acquisition of resistance genes via horizontal transfer, e.g., via transformation.\nIn 2017, two important studies shed some light on the mechanisms driving the evolution of resistance by persisters and tolerant bacteria. Firstly, in studies involving long exposure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to rifampin, Sebastian and colleagues concluded that persisters are a source of de novo resistant mutants [26]; secondly, Balaban and colleagues observed that the evolution of increased tolerance or persistence confer mutations in E. coli populations under intermittent ampicillin exposure [27]. In 2019, Windels and colleagues discovered a strong, positive correlation between persister levels and the probability of resistance evolving in natural isolates and laboratory strains of E. coli [28]. Although different types of antibiotics and different experimental conditions were used in these three studies, the results are consistent, strongly suggesting a widespread link between persistence/tolerance to antibiotics and the evolution of resistance to these drugs. Considerable efforts should hereafter be devoted to the development of strategies that can eliminate tolerant and persistent cells, which potentially favor the evolution of resistance [28].\nGiven the immense number of possible strategies for treating MDR and persistent bacteria, it is time to examine what was achieved so far by the different therapies available. Thus, the present review aims to gather the results of the most relevant studies, organized by type of drug administered or therapeutic strategy, in order to aid researchers in the fight against infectious diseases caused by MDR and persistent bacteria.\nThroughout this review, the most commonly studied strategies used against MDR bacteria and/or persisters are presented in two sections. In the first section, we present new therapies, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), anti-virulence compounds such as quorum sensing (QS) inhibitors, phages, and some new, chemically synthesized molecules, such as vitamin-A derivatives (retinoids). In the second section, we summarize the most important drug repurposing strategies (use of anti-inflammatories, anti-psychotics, anti-parasitics, anti-cancerous drugs, and statins) with potential antibacterial effects. These approaches are summarized in Figure 1.\nInterest in these therapies or strategies is increasing, as illustrated by the two new research topics in which we recently participated, which focus on the quorum network of MDR pathogens [29] and drug repurposing for bacterial and viral infections [30]. To shed further light on trends of concern to scientists around the globe, Figure 2 summarizes the number of annual publications available on the PubMed search engine per decade, from the 1940s until the present day.\n\n## 2. New Anti-Infectious Treatments against MDR and Persistent Bacteria\nIn this section, we highlight various new anti-infectious treatments against MDR and persistent bacteria.\n\n## 2.1. Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs)\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are currently being studied and developed for the treatment of recalcitrant bacterial infections, which are often caused by persistent bacteria. In relation to this relatively new therapy, the synergistic interactions between AMPs and antibiotics together with the anti-biofilm activity of AMPs are of great interest. Many AMPs are produced naturally by a broad range of organisms, while others are designed and chemically synthesized in the laboratory.\nIn a recent study, Yang and colleagues characterized nine fungal defensin-like peptides, i.e., peptides synthesized by neutrophils with antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties, and identified them as potent antibacterial compounds [31]. The peptides were expressed in Pichia pastoris, and their antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities against MDR and persistent S. aureus were evaluated. The study findings showed that a defensin-like peptide called P2 exhibited the highest activity and expression level with low toxicity, no resistance, high stability, and a MIC of <2 \u03bcg/mL. P2 bound to bacterial DNA, wrinkled the outer membrane, permeabilized the cytoplasmic membrane, and inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation. Importantly, P2 killed 99% of persistent bacteria, which were resistant to 100\u00d7 MIC of vancomycin. These data suggest that P2 may be a candidate in the development of novel antimicrobial agents against MDR and persistent staphylococcal infections.\nLi and colleagues characterized two novel peptides, P5 (YIRKIRRFFKKLKKILKK-NH2) and P9 (SYERKINRHFKTLKKNLKKK-NH2), which exhibit potent antimicrobial activities against both methicillin-sensitive S. aureus clinical isolates and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains [32]. As previously described for P2, these peptides did not cause significant hemolysis or cytotoxicity to renal epithelial cells. P5 and P9 significantly inhibited the S. aureus biofilm and disrupted the cell membrane, in addition to downregulating several virulence genes. P5 and P9 may, therefore, be promising antibacterial agents for the treatment of MRSA infections.\nIn 2019, Liu and colleagues investigated the potential applications of cationic peptides in the fight against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) [33] and found some peptides displaying moderate bactericidal activity against VRE, with MIC values of 2\u20138 \u03bcg/mL, as well as significant synergistic interactions between these peptides and vancomycin. The mechanism of action of these peptides is the inhibition of vanRS transcription, a key two-component system (TCS) in the resistance against vancomycin. These researchers showed that inhibition of vanRS transcription restored vancomycin activity. Consistent with in vitro results, the researchers observed higher survival rates in Galleria mellonella larvae treated with these cationic peptides plus vancomycin than in larvae treated with vancomycin alone. Together, these results suggest that cationic peptides show antibacterial activity against VRE and also reverse vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus, and they are, therefore, promising candidates for combating vancomycin-resistant pathogens.\n\n## 2.2. Anti-Virulence Compounds\nAnti-virulence compounds inhibit bacterial virulence factors, thus preventing the development of infection without affecting bacterial growth. In 2013, Pan and colleagues characterized a chemical compound called BF8 ((Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-methylfuran-2(5H)-one) that was able to reduce persistence of E. coli growth and revert the antibiotic tolerance of persisters [34]. BF8 is a QS inhibitor of E. coli which disrupts E. coli biofilms and renders associated cells more sensitive to ofloxacin. BF8 appeared safe to mammalian cells in vitro and showed no long-term cytotoxicity in vivo in a healthy mouse model.\nIn 2013, Conlon and colleagues developed an acyldepsipeptide antibiotic, called ADEP4, which can activate the ClpP protease and, thus, cause the death of persistent bacterial cells by degrading around 400 proteins [35]. In addition, this ADEP4 was also found to be active against persisters in both planktonic and biofilm states. A combination of ADEP4 with rifampicin completely killed S. aureus biofilms in vitro and in a chronic infection murine model in vivo.\nThe first compounds able to reduce the formation of antibiotic-tolerant persister cells of P. aeruginosa were identified by Starkey and colleagues [36]. Some of these compounds, such as M64, blocked the synthesis of both pro-persistence and pro-acute MvfR-dependent signaling molecules. MvfR, also referred to as PqsR, is the global virulence QS transcriptional regulator of P. aeruginosa. M64 was found to be active against MDR strains of P. aeruginosa that cause acute and persistent murine infections and it did not perturb bacterial growth, which limited selective resistance.\nRegarding E. coli, El Meouche and colleagues [37] demonstrated that the AcrAB\u2013TolC apparatus in E. coli increases the DNA mismatch repair system, promoting spontaneous mutations that can lead to high-level resistance to antibiotics. Thus, inhibitors of the AcrAB\u2013TolC efflux pump could not only re-activate the antibiotic sensitivity of E. coli cells but could also restore their mutation rates, potentially improving current treatments.\n\n## 2.3. Phage Therapy Alone or in Combination with Antibiotics to Treat MDR and Persistent Bacteria\nClearly some alternative antibacterial therapies must emerge in order to halt the spread of MDR organisms. In this context, phage therapy is an antibacterial approach that involves using natural bacterial viruses (known as bacteriophages or phages) that infect and lyse bacteria to treat or prevent infectious disease [38,39]. These viruses are natural predators of bacteria and, as recently reviewed by Divya and colleagues [40], phages were used as a primary treatment for bacterial diseases from their discovery in the 1900s for a period of 25 years, until they were absolutely eclipsed by antibiotics.\nOne of the advantages of phage therapy over broad-spectrum antibiotics is the high specificity toward target bacterial pathogens, with no adverse effects on the host itself or the host commensal microbiota [41], thus minimizing secondary effects. One interesting aspect of phage therapy is the synergistic interactions between phages and the host immune system [42]. Indeed, as it is not beneficial for phages to kill all of the host bacteria at the infection site (otherwise, they could not continue to replicate), they can be expected to control the bacterial pathogens and significantly reduce the population, thus providing the patient\u2019s immune system the chance to eliminate the remaining pathogens. Here, we cite a few examples of phage-based treatments of MDR and persistent infections.\nIn 2017, Schooley and colleagues reported that a 68-year-old diabetic patient with necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by an MDR A. baumannii infection was successfully treated with a personalized phage-based therapy consisting of nine lytic phages [43]. Five days after the bacteriophage-based therapy was started, once the infection was controlled, minocycline was administered, and infection was finally overcome.\nIn 2011, Khawaldeh et al. described the successful use of six lytic P. aeruginosa phages as an adjunctive therapy for a recurrent bladder infection in a 67-year-old woman, most likely caused by a persistent subpopulation of P. aeruginosa cells [44]. Antibiotics alone failed to overcome the infection, as is usually the case with recalcitrant, persistent bacteria. However, the combined use of meropenem and colistin and this phage cocktail led to the improvement of symptoms and a significant reduction in bacterial load, and the treatment was well-tolerated by the patient. The cocktail was applied every 12 h for 10 days and, from day eight onward, the bacterial count decreased until no viable bacteria were longer detected.\nStudies carried out by research teams led by Torres-Barcel\u00f3 [45] and Chaudhry [46] showed that the therapeutic effect was improved by starting treatment with antibiotic once the phages already started to fight infections caused by P. aeruginosa. Both of these studies highlight the importance of the sequential application of both treatments in order to achieve good results, as it appears that bacterial pathogens become more vulnerable to some antibiotics after phage treatment [47] and that the phages can even restore their sensitivity to antibiotics [48]. Importantly, phages can use bacterial efflux pumps as receptors, which would affect the clearance of antibiotics, one of the most widespread resistance mechanisms of bacteria [47].\nIn 2019, Blasco and colleagues described an engineered lysogenic phage (Ab105-2phi\u0394CI) in which repressor CI protein was deleted, thus becoming lytic [49]. These researchers used a sophisticated assay in the first study using a mutant lytic phage in combination with imipenem and meropenem antibiotics. The combination caused a significant decrease in A. baumannii MDR cells both in vitro and in vivo, with lower MICs needed for these carbapenems to be effective against the resistant pathogen.\nThe anti-biofilm activity of phage phi11 endolysin, which can kill staphylococcal biofilms via its two endopeptidase domains, was described for the first time in 2007 [50]. Research teams led by Fenton and Shen described lytic endolysins (CHAP(K) and PlyC) which successfully removed staphylococcal and streptococcal biofilms, respectively [51,52]. As biofilms are mainly composed of persistent cells, the use of phage-derived endolysins may represent an effective \u201canti-persister\u201d strategy. The lytic activity displayed by endolysin PlyE146 against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii [53] is important as these three bacteria are important nosocomial pathogens that represent a major risk to health. Finally, LysAB2 endolysin, described for the first time in 2011, showed activity against different bacterial species, such as MRSA, A. baumannii, and E. coli [54]. Interestingly, peptide-induced modification of endolysin LysAB2 broadened the range of lytic activity [54].\n\n## 2.4. New Molecules\nIn 2018, Kim and colleagues described the antibacterial activity of two synthetic retinoids (vitamin A analogues), named CD437 and CD1530 [55]. These compounds exhibited high in vivo killing rates of both growing and persister S. aureus cells, by disrupting lipid bilayers. The mechanism of action is as follows: the carboxylic acid and the phenolic groups anchor the retinoids to the surface of the bacterial membrane bilayer, by strongly binding to hydrophilic lipid heads. As a result, the retinoids penetrate the bilayers and become embedded orthogonally in the lipid molecules in the outer membrane leaflet, inducing substantial perturbations and permeabilizing the membranes of MRSA and persisters. In addition, both compounds displayed synergistic interactions with gentamicin, a low probability of resistance selection, and potent activity against a panel of clinical S. aureus and E. faecium strains. The major obstacle for developing retinoids as therapeutic agents is their potential cytotoxicity, which is a matter of considerable debate. However, none of the tested molecules exhibited cytotoxicity in vitro [55].\nThis discovery suggests the possibility of chemically changing these molecules to minimize their cytotoxicity and synthesizing more antimicrobial retinoid-based compounds. Indeed, approximately 4000 retinoid analogues were synthesized so far [56]. Deciphering the chemical properties and interactions between bacterial compounds and the candidate molecules will be essential in order to produce good antibacterial agents.\n\n## 3. Repurposing Treatments against MDR and Persistent Bacteria\nIn this era of MDR pathogens, during which the discovery and development of new antibiotics are limited and generally unsuccessful, new strategies must be employed to enhance the fight against infectious diseases. Thus, the use of non-antibiotic compounds, referred to as drug repurposing and \u201crepositioning\u201d, is of great interest. Focusing on drug repurposing strategies that were tested with MDR bacteria shows that resistance is rarely crossed, usually because the active molecule affects a different target from the antibiotic target. Moreover, time- and economic-related advantages of FDA-approved drugs must also be considered.\nIn this section, we describe various repurposing treatments against MDR and persistent bacteria.\n\n## 3.1. Anti-Inflammatories as Antibacterial Agents\nVijayashree and colleagues recently used in silico tools to study the antibacterial effects of acetaminophen and ibuprofen, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and analgesic drugs, against red-complex pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Tannerella forsythia), as these bacteria are associated with inflammatory conditions associated with periodontal disease [57]. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were found to interact by in silico approximations with bacterial cytoplasmic proteins involved in cellular processes, metabolism, and virulence. The authors claimed that bioinformatic prediction tools revealed multiple epitopes in the virulent proteins that should be targeted in in vitro assays.\nGlucocorticoids are a well-known class of anti-inflammatory drugs, but their use in patients with sepsis is highly controversial because of the immunosuppressive effects of these compounds [58]. Betamethasone is an anti-inflammatory steroid belonging to this class. Indeed, once in the nucleus, betamethasone stimulates the transcription and translation of lipocortin and vasocortin, two proteins that inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and histamine [59]. Although it may seem counterproductive to use these drugs in sepsis patients, as they mitigate the immune response, Emgard and colleagues showed that the topical steroid betamethasone was effective, by itself, for treating external otitis caused by P. aeruginosa and C. albicans [60]. These findings could be explained considering that inflammation is a major mechanism in the development of external otitis, similarly to what occurs in periodontal disease, as described above.\nFinally, we include here a cathelicidin-like antimicrobial peptide, Cbf-K16, characterized by Jiang and colleagues and proposed as an anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compound that can effectively kill clarithromycin- and amoxicillin-resistant Helicobacter pylori SS1, both in vitro and in a gastritis mouse model [61]. Cbf-K16 showed time-dependent killing kinetics, protection of H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells, and inhibition of interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion. Indeed, Cbf-K16 binds to genomic DNA, downregulating the expression of adhesion genes (alpA and alpB) and the virulence gene (cagA), thus indicating its potential use of the in the development of an anti-infective therapy.\n\n## 3.2. Anti-Psychotics\nA decade ago, Lieberman and Higgins screened the antibacterial activity of some compounds that affected neurological function, identifying 68 that disrupted infection of macrophages by Listeria monocytogenes [62]. After further examination of the compounds, these researchers indicated that thioridazine, an antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia during the last 40 years, and bepridil, a calcium channel blocker, decreased intracellular infection by L. monocytogenes in a dose-dependent manner by significantly inhibiting escape from vacuoles in vitro. Treatment of host cells with thioridazine or bepridil significantly decreased the ability of L. monocytogenes to escape the phagocytic vacuole, a step required to initiate intracellular replication. Although experiments were performed using the WT L. monocytogenes strain 10403S, this is an elegant example of a drug repurposing strategy, as calcium channel blockers can be used in the treatment of brain injury, as well as to combat bacterial pathogens. The effects of bepridil and thioridazine on persistent and resistant bacteria should be evaluated. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of thioridazine against other bacterial species, such as S. aureus [63] and M. tuberculosis, was also reported [64]. In the first case, the researchers observed that a dose of only 0.1 mg/L thioridazine completely inhibited the growth of S. aureus phagocytosed by macrophages, suggesting intracellular bactericidal activity. Nevertheless, thioridazine was withdrawn from use worldwide in 2005 because it caused severe cardiac arrhythmia in some patients (it binds to histamine receptors). However, some generic forms of this drug are still available in the US.\nIn 2016, Andersson and colleagues described the antibacterial effects of another antipsychotic drug, trifluoperazine [65]. Although trifluoperazine MIC values were too high to be reached in plasma and the drug did not affect the growth of Yersinia pestis cells or the expression/production of their type 3 secretion system (T3SS, an important virulent factor for this bacteria), use of this antipsychotic increased the survival of Y. pestis-infected macrophages in vitro and the survival of infected mice in vivo. Trifluoperazine was then tested in both Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Clostridium difficile infection murine models, where once again it significantly increased the survival of infected mice. Interestingly, although the antibacterial activity is yet to be described, a significantly higher survival rate of mice infected with Y. pestis, S. enterica, and C. difficile and treated with the drug was reported. It is, therefore, possible that the bactericidal activity is intracellular, as with thioridazine, another antipsychotic drug with a similar structure.\n\n## 3.3. Anti-Helminthic Drugs\nSalicylanilides are antiseptics that are used worldwide, and they are widely studied. These compounds are thought to act by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, thereby impairing the motility of parasites. Rajamuthiah and colleagues described the efficacy of niclosamide (a bacteriostatic agent included in the salicylanilide family) against methicillin-, vancomycin-, linezolid-, and daptomycin-resistant S. aureus isolates, and they concluded that they probably damage the bacterial membrane [66]. Niclosamide inhibits QS and virulence genes in P. aeruginosa [67], such as phospholipase C, LasA protease, pyocyanin, chitinase, and rhamnolipids. It also increases the negative charges on the cell walls of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, resulting in synergistic interaction with cationic colistin, resensitizing both pathogens to this antibiotic [68]. These studies show consistent results although they were performed with four different bacterial species and conditions.\nIn 2016, Gooyit and Janda reported that other members of the salicylanilide family, such as rafoxanide and closantel, presented greater bactericidal activity against the logarithmic and stationary phases of C. difficile than vancomycin [69]. Avermectins, a group of broad-spectrum anti-helminthics, demonstrated in vitro efficacy against M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium ulcerans, with MIC values ranging from 1 to 8 mg/L and 4 to 8 mg/L, respectively [70]. Ashraf and colleagues observed the bacteriostatic effect of ivermectin, an avermectin, against clinical isolates of S. aureus in vitro [71]. Ten years previously, Zhang and colleagues reported that ivermectin improved the survival of mice challenged by lethal doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), significantly reducing the levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1b, and IL-6 [72]. These researchers observed the same findings in vitro. Ivermectin also blocked the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-\u03baB) pathway and reduced endotoxemia (presence of endotoxins in the blood) and the associated inflammation.\n\n## 3.4. Anti-Cancerous Drugs as Antibacterials\nThe use of anti-cancer agents to treat bacterial pathogens may appear surprising. However, although cancer and infectious diseases differ in many aspects, drug-tolerant persisters also occur in cancer cell populations and are implicated in the recurrence of tumors.\nCheng and colleagues recently used an A. baumannii strain resistant to most antibiotics (AB5075) and reported that three antineoplastics (5-fluorouracil, 6-thioguanine, and pifithrin-\u03bc), an anti-rheumatic (auranofin), an antipsychotic (fluspirilene), an anti-inflammatory (Bay 11-7082) and an alcohol detergent (disulfiram) inhibited th",
