  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nWorldwide, prostate cancer (PC) is the second most frequent cancer among men and the fifth leading cause of death [1]. In the initial stage, PC can be asymptomatic or manifest itself through difficulty with urination and frequent urination, as well as nocturia. In more advanced cases, symptoms include urinary retention and, in cases of bone metastasis, back pain may occur [1].\nIn recent years, the concept of repurposed drugs has emerged, and it consists of identifying and developing new therapeutic indications for existing drugs [2,3,4]. Repurposing drugs has many advantages (Scheme 1), because these drugs have already been comprehensively studied and there is already a lot of information available about them, such as their safety, toxicity and side effects, therapeutic doses, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and drug production, which reduces investigation time and financial investments in pre-clinical trials and phase I and II clinical trials. The literature also reports that most repurposed drugs are well tolerated by oral administration, and as many of these drugs are already accessible on the generic drug market, they have become available to all people [5,6].\nTherefore, the number of repurposed drugs for several diseases has increased, just like in oncology, an area in which there is a particular interest in this topic, not only to prevent the significant side effects that are associated with chemotherapy, and which have high impact on cancer patients\u2019 life quality, but also to increase patients\u2019 survival and reverse resistance to antineoplastic drugs. Therefore, the objective of repurposing drugs in oncology is related to the identification of drugs whose original approval is not antineoplastic, but that present anticancer activity, taking into account that these drugs must not have significant side effects [2,4,6].\nOn the other hand, the literature mentions that the use of combined pharmacological therapies of two or three drugs with different mechanisms of action and signaling pathways can be useful, because they trigger a synergistic response that reduces the concentrations of individual drugs to optimize the therapy, increase the success rate and minimize/delay drug resistance. So, in combined therapy, a chemotherapeutic drug can be used with a repurposed drug, and particularly in PC, several drugs seem to be potential candidates for drug repurposing and combination therapy, with the advantage of being able to be used in other cancer types, because different tumors may have the same signaling pathways [2,7,8]. This study is extremely important, because it presents drugs organized by pharmacotherapeutic class that can be repurposed for PC treatment, distinguishing itself from other works by presenting not only drugs that are widely discussed in other literature reviews but also drugs that are very promising but less discussed, such as saquinavir, which shows good results when combined with conventional chemotherapy. Therefore, this review can open new doors in oncological treatments, supporting the repurposing of drugs instead of developing new molecules.\n\n## 2.1. Antidyslipidemic Drugs\nIn general, the severity of PC depends on the levels of circulating androgens, mainly testosterone, which, like other androgens, is a cholesterol derivative [9]. Thus, patients with PC generally have high cholesterol production because PC cells depend more on the endogenous production of cholesterol than dietary cholesterol. For that reason, men with high levels of serum cholesterol are at greater risk of developing PC, and it is known that cholesterol also plays an important role in the growth, proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells [10].\nSo, it is known that androgen deprivation therapy, the standard treatment for PC, inhibits androgen synthesis in testicles and, consequently, decreases the levels of systemic androgens, but despite the low availability of circulating androgens, tumor progression continues, because there is an intratumoral synthesis of androgens from the existing cholesterol [11]. Thus, statins are antidyslipidemic drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and block mevalonate production, which is a cholesterol precursor that allows for controlling the synthesis of androgens from cholesterol, which could explain the synergistic effect of statins in androgen deprivation therapy [2,5,10,11]. On the other hand, it is known that the metabolic pathway of mevalonate is associated with Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and Tafazzin protein (TAZ), which are related to tumor growth and tumor progression. Thus, statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, blocking mevalonate production and inhibiting YAP/TAZ [12].\nTherefore, statins reduce serum cholesterol levels, and in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that they reduce PC progression and the incidence of lethal PC, improve prognosis and survival rates and decrease the tumor volume and serum levels of the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA), and they are also radiosensitizing agents (Table 1). Radiotherapy is one of several standard PC treatments [2,5,10,12]. In addition to this, statins have demonstrated antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, antitumor effects, an ability to suppress the production of essential metabolites for different cellular functions and for post-translational modification of cell signaling proteins and the capability to inhibit angiogenesis, metastases and tumor proliferation [12].\nIt is also known that statins reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (30 to 60%), total cholesterol (23 to 28%) and triglycerides (25 to 45%), which is extremely useful in PC treatment, since in this tumor, there is a deregulation of lipid metabolism that results in excessive lipid accumulation. Thus, statins will eventually act on both serum cholesterol and intratumoral cholesterol, which is an advantage, because men with high serum cholesterol seem to have a higher risk of developing more aggressive PC and higher mortality rates. On the other hand, significant amounts of statins were detected in the prostate tissue of several patients, which allows us to conclude that statins have a direct effect on prostate cells, and after a four-week treatment with statins, it is already possible to detect them in prostatic tissue [11].\nSome of the most important statins that can be repurposed for PC treatment are atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin mevastatin, lovastatin and rosuvastatin, which can be administered in monotherapy or in combination with other drugs, although recent studies indicate that the main focus is currently on atorvastatin and simvastatin [12]. In a clinical trial with men with advanced PC, atorvastatin reduced serum PSA levels when compared to the placebo and after 27 days of administration, it decreased the tumor proliferation. In another study, after the administration of 80 mg of atorvastatin for 27 days before prostatectomy, it was possible to detect the drug in the prostatic tissue of 50% of the evaluated men. On the other hand, atorvastatin also presents benefits when combined with radiotherapy, since it increases the radiosensitivity of hypoxia-induced PC cells by decreasing the HIF-1\u03b1 expression. Other studies have shown that when prostatectomy is preceded by the administration of fluvastatin, significant apoptosis occurs, and after 4 to 12 weeks of the administration of 80 mg of fluvastatin, this drug was detected in the prostate tissue of 10 of the 28 patients evaluated with localized PC. Moreover, dipyridamole, an antiplatelet agent, when administered in combination with fluvastatin, reduces the amount of fluvastatin needed to induce the death of PC cells. Concerning simvastatin, it is known that it can resensitize PC cell lines that have developed resistance to enzalutamide (a second-generation non-steroidal antiandrogen that competes with androgens for binding sites in the prostate) and that acts through apoptosis caused by cholesterol depletion and inhibition of the Protein Kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway [5,10,11,12,13,14]. On the other hand, it also prevents tumor growth, reduces PSA levels and, when administered in combination with irinotecan, suppression of tumor growth and induction of apoptosis caused by inhibition of the MCL-1 protein occur [12].\nRegarding lovastatin and simvastatin, they inhibit the activity of RhoA protein, activate caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9, induce apoptosis, reduce the expression of Retinoblastoma Protein (Rb), phosphorylate Rb, D1 and D3 cyclins and CDK4 and CDK6, and increase the expression of p21 and p27 in PC cells [12]. Atorvastatin, mevastatin, simvastatin and rosuvastatin decrease the colonies of PC cells and reduce their migration due to the inhibition of Geranylgeranyl Pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthesis [12]. Furthermore, a recent study showed that statins, particularly fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin, when administered at a high cumulative defined daily dose (CDDD), were associated with a lower risk of PC, and its use for more than five years can reduce the incidence of PC, which leads to the conclusion that high and long-term DDCDs are associated with a lower risk and lower incidence of PC and that they can be used to prevent its onset [18].\nAdditionally, despite not belonging to the statin group, fenofibrate is also an antidyslipidemic drug that activates Peroxisome-Proliferator-Activated Receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), which plays a key role in lipid metabolism, having the ability to increase lipolysis. Therefore, at the PC level, fenofibrate induces apoptosis in tumor cells, reduces their dissemination and complicates the metastasis process due to cyclin D1 and E2F1 protein inhibition and the increase in the pro-apoptotic protein Bax [12,19]. Fenofibrate also decreases androgen receptors\u2019 expression and their target genes by decreasing the levels of phosphorylated Akt and induces apoptosis by producing oxidative stress, including Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) inhibition [12].\nSo, both statins and fenofibrate have antiproliferative, antimetastatic and apoptotic properties in PC cells and also in other types of cancers, such as melanomas, neuroblastomas and gastric and hepatic cancer, among others [2,19].\n\n## 2.2. Antidiabetic Drugs\nType 2 diabetes mellitus represents about 90% of diabetes cases and is one of the risk factors for the development of several cancers, such as liver, pancreas, colorectal, kidney, bladder, endometrium and breast cancer. In addition, diabetes is also associated with high levels of mortality in oncological situations, namely in PC, but several studies have shown that diabetes mellitus seems to reduce the risk of PC incidence, which appears to be related to the low plasma levels of Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in diabetic people compared to in non-diabetic people [20].\nMetformin is an antidiabetic drug that belongs to the biguanide group and decreases insulin tissue resistance and hepatic glucose production and, consequently, reduces serum glucose levels. In addition, metformin has also shown good results in PC treatment because it promotes apoptosis in PC cells since it deregulates the Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway and minimizes growth, proliferation and tumor cell differentiation. Metformin is also associated with a reduction in the incidence and mortality of PC, showing good results when combined with chemotherapy [2,5,20].\nIn addition to this, metformin inhibits PC growth, which is related to Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) activation, since AMPK blocks the cell cycle and, consequently, prevents cell growth. AMPK activation by metformin leads to Akt, p70S6 kinase and the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inactivation, resulting in Akt/mTOR signaling pathway inhibition. mTOR and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibition blocks protein synthesis and fatty acid synthesis, respectively. Metformin also acts at the level of REDD1 (mTOR and cyclin D1 inhibitor) and inhibits GTPase Rac1, which leads to a reduction in PC metastases; inhibits the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transformation (EMT) process; decreases the expression c-MYC oncogene, SOX4 transcription factor and FoxM1 transcription factor, the latter two of which are associated with PC cell migration; increases miR30a expression (tumor suppressor); inhibits Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) phosphorylation and oxidation; and decreases the incidence of prostate intraepithelial lesions [21,22].\nMetformin reduces Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2), Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and STAT3 expression, which is an advantage since the COX-2/PGE2/STAT3 axis is responsible for drug resistance, metastasis and tumor relapse. Another mechanism associated with metformin is a reduction in androgen receptor signaling, which may also be related to AMPK activation. The inhibition of IGF-1 by metformin is also essential, since IGF-1 is associated with PC cell growth [21,22].\nAdditionally, in the group of sulfonylureas, glipizide stands out, because it increases insulin secretion from the pancreatic \u03b2 cells, which occurs due to the blocking of potassium channels in these cells\u2019 membrane, leading to their depolarization and subsequent opening of the calcium channels, which leads to the entry of calcium ions and insulin exiting [20]. In this way, glipizide inhibits angiogenesis in in vivo models with PC, although it does not block cell proliferation [5,20].\n\n## 2.3. Antiparasitic Drugs\nIn this group, both anthelmintics and antimalarial drugs seem to be useful in PC treatment. Regarding anthelmintics, mebendazole was originally used to treat parasite infections, but due to its ability to inhibit microtubule polymerization and, consequently, trigger the apoptotic process, it can be used in PC treatment, namely in combination with docetaxel, because of their combined synergistic effect in terms of apoptosis and blocking tumor growth in PC, which has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo [5,23]. This therapeutic combination shows good synergistic results, since docetaxel binds to tubulin, promotes its polymerization and, consequently, the stabilization of microtubules, instead of mebendazole, which inhibits microtubule polymerization, which affects the dynamics of microtubules and causes aberrant mitoses, namely, problems in achromatic spindle formation, multipolar divisions and aneuploidies [23].\nOn the other hand, niclosamide decreases the expression of a specific group of androgen receptors, the V7 receptors, which are extremely important in castration-resistant PC, and which are associated with enzalutamide resistance, and for this reason, niclosamide has become useful to sensitize patients to enzalutamide treatment [2,5,24]. In addition, niclosamide acts via the inhibition of signaling pathways that are related to oncogenesis and prostate tumor progression, such as Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-\u03baB), Notch, mTORC1, STAT3 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, where it acts on the LRP6 coreceptor, degrading it [2,12].\nIvermectin, which is also in the anthelmintic group, acts on PC via cell cycle arrest, inducing apoptosis and a decrease in androgen receptor expression, and these are associated with a Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and a decrease in cyclins D and E and an increase in p21. Ivermectin also acts on the FOXA1 protein and Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, inhibiting them and blocking androgen receptor signaling, E2F1 expression and DNA damage repair, resulting in cell cycle arrest [25,26].\nIn addition to this, ivermectin causes a synergistic effect in combination with docetaxel, reduces cancer cells\u2019 viability, causing their apoptosis and, consequently, decreases the tumor size. Although the synergic mechanism of these two drugs is still not well understood, it may be related to the inhibition of multidrug resistance (MDR) caused by ivermectin [25].\nThe literature also presents evidence of antimalarial drug benefits arising from PC treatments such as artemisinin, since both artemisinin and several of its metabolites (dihydroartemisinin) and derivatives (artesunate) induce cell death. Therefore, the anticancer activity of dihydroartemisinin is due to its capacity to inhibit translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) expression, while artesunate causes cell cycle arrest, autophagy and angiogenesis inhibition and decreases tumor invasion and metastases and accumulates in lysosomes, promoting ferritin degradation in cancer cells and increasing reactive oxygen species production, which leads to cell death [5,27,28].\nIn addition to these drugs, chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine have also demonstrated an ability to interact with nucleotides and induce apoptosis, having shown antitumor, antiproliferative and antimutagenic properties, since they are autophagy inhibitors and, therefore, prevent cancer cells from using autophagy to acquire energy and nutrients [5,17].\nChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine permeabilize the lysosome membrane, resulting in the release of lysosomal enzymes that permeabilize the mitochondrial membrane, producing an apoptosome and, consequently, leading to apoptosis. In the specific case of chloroquine, it induces p53, inhibits anti-apoptotic and survival processes, promotes chromatin folding and, consequently, reduces DNA repair mechanisms [17].\nThus, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seem to be good candidates for administration in radiotherapy (Table 1) and chemotherapy either in neoadjuvant or adjuvant regimens or even concomitantly, but never in monotherapy, because extremely high doses are needed to inhibit tumor growth. Despite this, their synergistic effects would be beneficial because they can act as a chemotherapy in neoplastic cells. However, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine modulate the patient\u2019s immune response and, for this reason, have the disadvantage of suppressing the immune response against the tumor when administered for long periods, because of their immunosuppressive activity [17]. Quinacrine, another antimalarial drug, also shows favorable results because it activates p53, a tumor suppressor gene [5].\nFinally, another antiparasitic drug that can be repurposed is suramin, which reduces serum PSA levels and it has been tested in patients with castration-resistant PC; however, quinacrine\u2019s and suramin\u2019s anticancer mechanisms of action are still unknown [5,29].\n\n## 2.4. Antiarrhythmic Drugs\nDigoxin and ouabain are cardiac glycosides in the antiarrhythmic drug class that inhibit the sodium\u2013potassium pump, leading to the intracellular accumulation of calcium and, finally, to PC cell apoptosis, and they also induce cell cycle arrest and autophagy and have antiproliferative properties [2,5,12].\nThe literature indicates that the sodium\u2013potassium pump has the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits; the \u03b1 subunit is downregulated in oncological situations and the glycosylated \u03b2 subunit is involved in the metastasis process of tumor cells. Thus, these drugs have potential to be repurposed for PC treatment, but more studies are needed to prove their effectiveness, since the existing results are limited due to the small samples used [12].\nThus, digoxin inhibits the topoisomerase II enzyme, produces interleukin 8 and decreases PSA serum levels and tumor growth. This drug also has an inhibitory effect on PC and, when administered in nanomolar concentrations, inhibits HIF-1\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2, although little is known about this possible candidate [2,5,12]. With regard to ouabain, it sensitizes PC cells to apoptosis, due to the inhibition of survivin, which blocks the apoptotic process; decreases STAT3 expression, which is overexpressed in PC; increases PAR-4 expression; leads to mitochondrial membrane potential loss; and inhibits expression of the HOXB-13 gene, which is overexpressed in the PC and is associated with PC and its metastases, because it is related to the migration and invasion of tumor cells, with ouabain triggering apoptosis via HOXB-13 expression inhibition. Finally, ouabain also inhibits topoisomerase I and II, showing anticancer activity in castration-resistant PC when administered in nanomolar concentrations [2,5,12].\n\n## 2.5. Anti-Inflammatory Drugs\nThe mechanism of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is related to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition, which leads to decreased prostaglandin production, although these drugs also act via blocking cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, and have shown good results in PC treatment, namely in patients who developed resistance to therapy [2,5]. Within the NSAIDs group, selective COX-2 inhibitors stand out, since COX-2 is expressed in PC cells and in the vasculature that feeds them; therefore, drugs such as celecoxib seem to be beneficial, and in addition to this, they also block Akt phosphorylation and activation and inhibit the activity of NF-\u03baB, among other mechanisms that lead to PC cell apoptosis [1,2,5]. On the other hand, the combination of atorvastatin with celecoxib in in vivo studies seems to block tumor growth and tumor progression because of the inhibition of Akt, Erk1/2 and NF-\u03baB, and in vitro, this combination induces autophagy in PC cells [12,30].\nHowever, there are other NSAIDs that are non-selective COX inhibitors and that also have antineoplastic potential, such as indomethacin, which inhibits angiogenesis and the growth of cancer cells through COX-1, COX-2, MAPK and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibition and PKC-p38-DRP1-dependent mitochondrial dynamic impairment, and may be effective when used in combination with enzalutamide due to decreased production or utilization of androgens by cancer cells [5]. Diclofenac is another promising drug that inhibits COX, prostaglandin synthesis and the MYC gene family, which is overexpressed in several types of tumors, and seems to interfere with glucose metabolism and its uptake by PC cells, which occurs because the overexpression of MYC is associated with Glucose Transporters-1 (GLUT1) and Lactate Dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) upregulation, culminating in high rates of glucose uptake and glycolysis. By inhibiting MYC through the administration of diclofenac, glucose metabolism is regulated through a decrease in the expression of GLUT1 and LDHA. Diclofenac may also be useful in combination with radiotherapy, because it also has radiosensitizing properties (Table 1) [2].\nSimilarly to what has already been discussed, acetylsalicylic acid also inhibits COX and prostaglandin synthesis and inhibits NF-\u03baB induced by the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), helping in the overexpression of tumor suppressor genes and in the decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, making it a candidate for drug repurposing in PC; it is also being evaluated for its efficacy in combination with statins to reduce the levels of the cyclin D1 protein, whose overexpression is associated with tumor development [5]. Furthermore, several studies indicate that NSAIDs can reduce the probability of developing PC through their possible prophylactic effect and also reducing the levels of mortality associated with PC [1,10].\nRegarding the steroid anti-inflammatory drug group, also called corticosteroids, dexamethasone stood out in in silico studies for inhibiting the ERG oncogene of PC cells [2,5]. However, currently, dexamethasone is already used in several conventional protocols of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for different tumors types; in the first case, it is administered with the aim of preventing emesis induced by chemotherapy, and in the second case it is given as a prophylactic medicine to treat pain induced by radiotherapy [2,31,32].\n\n## 2.6. Antibacterial Drugs\nMonoamine Oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitors gained visibility in the topic of repurposing PC drugs after the discovery that high levels of MAO-A were associated with the severity of this cancer, due to the production of reactive oxygen species, and these drugs have demonstrated the ability to reduce metastasis and increase survival in in vivo tests, particularly isoniazid, which is an irreversible MAO-A inhibitor. Therefore, isoniazid may have particular potential in metastatic PC and in more advanced stages in which there is resistance to chemotherapy treatment because MAO-A expression also increases after treatments with docetaxel, resulting in resistance to chemotherapy treatment [33].\nMinocycline is a tetracycline derivative that inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines and metalloproteinases that are associated with tumor invasion and metastasis development, and, for this reason, this drug is in clinical trials to be repurposed for PC treatment, in which it has been found that minocycline inhibits LYN kinase and STAT3, suppresses EMT and consequently blocks metastases [2,34]. On the other hand, the chemical modification of tetracyclines (CMT-3) by activating caspase-3 and caspase-9 and by inhibiting metalloproteinases induces apoptosis in PC cells [2,5].\nThrough in silico studies, it was concluded that sulfamethoxypyridazine and azlocilline may also be administered in the treatment of PC, because they act in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR), which, in the specific case of PC, is associated with angiogenesis and tumor progression; however, there is still a lack of information about the effect of these two drugs in PC treatment [35]. Clofoctol inhibits the translation of proteins from PC cells, inhibiting the growth of the PC itself, which is due to the stress induction in the endoplasmic reticulum and mechanisms of protection against the unfolded protein response (UPR), which suppresses protein translation, and in addition to this, it also inhibits cyclins and promotes cell cycle arrest [2,5]. Finally, nitroxoline inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, limits angiogenesis, induces cell cycle arrest through inhibition of the cyclin D1-Rb-Cdc25A axis and induces apoptosis in tumor cells, because it activates AMPK and inhibits mTOR, which is a fundamental kinase in the cell proliferation process. It further decreases Cdc25A protein expression, which is essential for the proper functioning of the cell cycle, decreases cyclins D1, E, A and B1 levels and inhibits Rb phosphorylation [2,5,36].\n\n## 2.7. Antiviral Drugs\nRegarding the antiviral drugs group, nelfinavir proved to be a good candidate for PC treatment, both in monotherapy and in combination with radiotherapy (Table 1) or chemotherapy, since it inhibits regulated intramembrane proteolysis, STAT3 and Akt, induces apoptosis and autophagy, activates both caspase-9 and caspase-6 and inhibits angiogenesis and androgen receptor activation [2,5,15]. So, nelfinavir prevents the cleavage of S2P endopeptidase and promotes SREBP-1 and ATF6 accumulation, which induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and triggers the UPR mechanism, which, after being exceeded, leads to apoptosis [15]. Nelfinavir also inhibits the activation and expression of FASN, which catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and is overexpressed in several tumors. It has been classified as an oncogene, so its inhibition leads to the repression of tumor growth and survival [15].\nSaquinavir also demonstrated good results in vitro, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Fluorouracil (5-FU), which may reduce the toxicity associated with chemotherapy [16]. Thus, saquinavir decreases cell proliferation and invasion, has antitumor and anti-angiogenic properties and induces apoptosis, more specifically through the inhibition of the 20s and 26s proteasome and NF-\u03baB and PI3K/Akt inactivation. More than that, saquinavir also showed radiosensitizing properties in PC cells (Table 1), due to its ability to inhibit proteasome function [16].\nThe drugs didanosine, entecavir, acyclovir, valganciclovir, penciclovir, ganciclovir and valacyclovir have shown in in silico studies that they may be good candidates for PC treatment, as they inhibit the enzyme Poly [ADP-ribose] Polymerase 1 (PARP-1), which plays a fundamental role in the signaling and repair of DNA errors; therefore, by inhibiting PARP in cancer cells, an accumulation of errors that are not repaired and that will lead to cell death can be induced, and PARP is expressed in breast, ovary and prostate tumors [37,38]. On the other hand, glecaprevir and simeprevir are also strong candidates to be repurposed for PC treatment, as they act at GPR 160 and CRHR2, which are part of the G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that regulate growth and cell metabolism and are involved in the tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and apoptosis of cancer cells. Therefore, certain GPCR members, namely GPR 160 and CRHR2, are overexpressed in several types of cancer, including PC, being promising targets in PC treatment [39].\n\n## 2.8. Antidepressant Drugs\nRegarding tricyclic antidepressants, nortriptyline has shown anticancer effects, particularly in PC, because it inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis due to increased intracellular calcium in PC cells and induces cytotoxicity through cell cycle interruption by inhibition of CDK1 and by inhibiting Rb expression, affecting the Rb/E2F complex and, consequently, inhibiting the expression of E2F target genes, since Rb phosphorylation must occur for E2F to be separated from the Rb/E2F complex and activate the expression of genes required for the S-phase transition [40,41,42].\nIn the group of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sertraline reduces the proliferation of PC cells both in vivo and in vitro, as it also increases calcium intracellular concentration in PC cells and can stop the cell cycle, induces apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction and by the production of reactive oxygen species, increasing hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels and decreasing glutathione, inhibiting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis and reducing the metastatic potential of PC [6,28]. Sertraline decreases the levels of TCTP, a pro",
