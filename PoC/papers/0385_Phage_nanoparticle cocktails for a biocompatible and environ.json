  "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance continues to rise, necessitating alternative strategies. Bacteriophages have emerged as promising natural antibacterial agents, offering a targeted approach to combating bacterial infections. Combining bacteriophages with nanoparticles presents a novel approach that could enhance antibacterial potency while reducing the risk of resistance. While phage/antibiotic cocktails are widely explored to enhance antibacterial efficacy and prevent resistance, research on phage/nanoparticle combinations remains limited. We explore the synergy between green tea extract-capped silver nanoparticles (G-TeaNPs) and bacteriophages in combating pathogenic bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica). G-TeaNPs show minimal antiphage activity, ensuring compatibility in phage-NP formulations. These combinations significantly reduce bacterial counts in a short time (only 3\u00a0h), e.g., S. aureus survival is around 30% after incubation with just 0.001\u00a0mg/mL of G-TeaNPs, while G-TeaNPs and phages alone result in around 80% and 70% survival, respectively. Cytotoxicity tests against eukaryotic 3T3 NIH fibroblast cells confirm biocompatibility at effective concentrations. Additionally, we examine G-TeaNPs' impact on the free-living protist Acanthamoeba castellanii. Both green tea extract and G-TeaNPs can reduce A. castellanii cell counts by 80%, but only at high concentrations. Microscopy revealed nanoparticle uptake by amoebae, causing intracellular accumulation and vacuolization, while green tea extract induced similar changes without uptake. Our findings highlight G-TeaNPs as safe, effective agents in phage/nanoparticle antibacterial formulations with dual antimicrobial and amoebicidal properties for therapeutic and environmental applications. KEYPOINTS: \u2022 Silver nanoparticles synthesized with tea extracts (G-TeaNPs) have a minimal effect on the tested viruses. \u2022 Combining G-TeaNP with bacteriophages offers new-generation antibacterial cocktails. \u2022 Green tea extracts and AgNPs present concentration-dependent anti-amoebic activity.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nPhages eliminate approximately 40% of bacterial biomass daily (Ranveer et al. 2024). However, research on the effects of phages on cohabiting microorganisms remains limited and is often overlooked, even in complex ecosystems (Czajkowski et al. 2019). While phages have been a focal point of studies in environments such as food processing, the human gut, and plant crops, much remains unknown about the role of environmental phages and their impact across different contexts (Ranveer et al. 2024). Although the use of lytic phages to control bacterial pathogens (phage therapy) for nearly a century, the recent rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has sparked renewed interest in phage research. Phage therapy, particularly in clinical and veterinary settings, has gained attention for its therapeutic and antibacterial potential (Rai et al. 2024). More broadly, phages have been used as biological control agents to reduce bacterial loads in various contexts, such as targeting Listeria monocytogenes in food processing, controlling zoonotic pathogens in food animals, and treating crops for plant pathogenic bacteria (Abedon et al. 2017). Since the twenty-first century, research has significantly advanced our understanding of phage biology and immunology, ensuring the safety of phage therapy through modern technologies like whole-genome sequencing and automation (Kortright et al. 2019). Phage therapy is now used to treat various infections, with FDA-approved clinical trials showing no safety concerns. Renewed research and ongoing trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of phage therapy, offering a promising solution to the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant infections (Massoud et al. 2015; Maimaiti et al. 2023). The main disadvantage concerns identifying appropriate lytic phages with high virulence and a broad-spectrum of bacterial hosts to suit different patients (Zalewska-Pi\u0105tek 2023). Several other factors contribute to the infrequent commercialization of phage preparations, including high costs, challenges in patenting (Lin et al. 2021), and the absence of regulatory approval for large-scale use (Jault et al. 2018).\nWhile, despite its promising potential, phage therapy has not received widespread regulatory approval for human use, nanotechnology offers a more favorable approach to overcoming several challenges associated with phage preparations. Advances in nanotechnology, such as nano-encapsulation, provide solutions to pharmacological and clinical obstacles by shielding phages from the host immune system and environmental factors, ensuring controlled release, and enhancing delivery efficiency (Kaur et al. 2021). Encapsulation can form nanovesicles that shield phages and provide a controlled release (Gonz\u00e1lez-Men\u00e9ndez et al. 2018). Nanofibers produced through electro-spinning offer another method to enhance phage therapy outcomes (Kaur et al. 2021). Integrating nanotechnology with phage therapy optimizes the pharmacokinetic profile of phages, ensuring better therapeutic efficacy and overcoming the limitations of phage-only formulations.\nPhages are often tested as cocktails with antibiotics (Kim et al. 2024). By combining the precision of bacteriophages, which selectively target and lyse specific bacterial strains, with the broad-spectrum efficacy of antibiotics, these cocktails enhance bacterial eradication while reducing the likelihood of resistance development. Phages can disrupt bacterial biofilms, increasing antibiotic penetration and effectiveness (Kebriaei et al. 2023), while antibiotics can weaken bacterial defenses, making them more susceptible to phage attacks (Akturk et al. 2023). There are also attempts to mix phages with other adjuvants, e.g., essential oils (Elafify et al. 2025).\nNot many reports show the simultaneous action of phages and nanoparticles. For example, a combination of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and bacteriophage ZCSE2 demonstrated enhanced antibacterial properties against Salmonella, with effective MIC and MBC values at 23 \u03bcg/mL (Abdelsattar et al. 2021). Similarly, gold nanorods conjugated with chimeric M13 phages, forming \u201cphanorods,\u201d effectively targeted P. aeruginosa biofilms in wound infections, highlighting their potential for treating superficial infections (Pardo-Freire and Domingo-Calap 2023). Another study synthesized Ag-CS nanoparticles with phages, achieving significant bactericidal and inhibitory effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and biofilm production with MIC values between 31.2 and 62.2 \u03bcg/mL and MBC values between 15.6 and 500 \u03bcg/mL (Abdelsattar et al. 2023). Additionally, T7 phages armed with silver nanoparticles efficiently eradicated bacterial biofilms and were non-toxic to eukaryotic cells, indicating a synergistic and safe strategy for biofilm treatment (Szymczak et al. 2024; Szymczak and Golec 2024). Beyond bacterial infections, the integration of therapeutic viruses and nanomaterials has also revolutionized cancer therapy, enabled precision targeting, and reduced side effects, thus presenting a novel approach to overcoming the limitations of traditional treatments (Li et al. 2023). These examples underscore the potential of phage/nanoparticle combinations as potent antimicrobial and therapeutic agents.\nAs described in our previous study tea extracts, with emphasis on green tea, are characterized by a rich composition of flavanols and polyphenols, including catechins as one of the major classes of polyphenolic compounds. Polyphenols serve as both reducing and capping agents during nanoparticle synthesis. In the presence of metal ions, the hydroxyl groups of catechin molecules act as electron donors, reducing silver ions (Ag+) to metallic silver (Ag0). Subsequent interactions between polyphenols and the resulting silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) facilitate surface capping, which prohibits agglomeration and contributes to the overall stability of the preparation (Rolim et al. 2019; Raza et al. 2023). Additionally, tea extracts-capped nanoparticles are recognized for their superior antimicrobial activity compared to \u201ctraditional\u201d silver nanoparticles (Xin et al. 2022; Fahim et al. 2024; Shahzadi et al. 2025).\nIn this study, we verified whether metal NPs could be effectively used against viruses. We confirmed that AgNPs, including NPs synthesized using green tea extracts, had no significant \u201cantiphagent\u201d activity towards the examined viruses. This observation allowed us to prepare phage/NP cocktails of superior activity toward bacterial pathogens. These formulations presented improved antibacterial activity compared to frequently used phage/antibiotic cocktails. Finally, using mammalian cells and the free-living unicellular organism A. castellanii, we proved that our nanoparticles were safe at dedicated concentrations for both humans and aquatic protists. Additionally, we explained the potential amoebicidal activity of green tea extracts and G-TeaNPs.\n\n## Synthesis of C-AgNPs and G-TeaNPs\nAll commercially available reagents were used as received without further purification. According to the product specifications provided by the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich), reagent purity exceeded 98%, as determined by gas chromatography (GC) analysis or titration with appropriate reagents. A control batch of silver nanoparticles was synthesized following a modified version of the method by Agnihotri et al. (Agnihotri et al. 2014). In short, an aqueous solution (48 mL) containing 2\u00a0mM NaBH4 and 2\u00a0mM trisodium citrate (TSC) was heated to 60 \u00b0C and stirred for 30 min. Next, the AgNO3 solution (2 mL, 11.7 mM) was added dropwise. The mixture was heated to 90 \u00b0C, and the pH was adjusted to 10.5 using 0.1 M NaOH. Finally, the reaction was stirred further at 90 \u00b0C for 20 min until an evident color change was observed.\nGreen tea silver nanoparticles (G-TeaNPs) were synthesized using a slightly modified method by Nakhjavani et al. (Nakhjavani et al. 2017), according to the protocol described in our previous study (Raza et al. 2023). In short, green tea leaves (Loyd, Mokate, Poland) were frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. To prepare the extract, 10 g of the ground tea leaves were brewed in 100 mL of hot distilled water (60 \u00b0C) for 15 min. The extract was then cooled to room temperature, centrifuged twice (9000 rpm for 10 min, followed by 15,000 rpm for 10 min) to remove debris, and filtered using a 0.22 \u03bcm syringe filter. For nanoparticle synthesis, 12 mL of the filtered extract was mixed with 13 mL of ultrapure water and stirred in an Erlenmeyer flask while 750 \u03bcL of 10 mM AgNO3 was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2\u00a0h, during which the solution\u2019s color turned yellow\u2013brown with a silver shine, indicating nanoparticle formation. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was redispersed in distilled water. This purification step was repeated six times. Finally, the nanoparticles were suspended TM buffer solution at a concentration of 1\u00a0mg/mL and stored at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for later use.\n\n## DLS and zeta potential\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements were determined using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) equipped with a DLS module (He\u2013Ne laser 633 nm, max 4 mW, allowing for measuring backscattered (175\u00b0) and forward-scattered (12.8\u00b0) light). Quasi-backscattered light was used for the measurements. One centimeter quartz cuvettes (Hellma, Germany) were used.\n\n## Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)\nScanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging was performed using a Nova NanoSEM 450 under high vacuum conditions (~ 10\u22127\u00a0mbar). Samples were deposited onto a silicon substrate, air-dried, and affixed to a standard SEM stub using carbon tape. Imaging was conducted with the Through-Lens Detector (TLD) in secondary electron mode at a primary beam energy of 10 kV and a working distance of 4.8 mm. Nanoparticle (NP) diameters were quantified from SEM images using ImageJ software, with measurements obtained from a minimum of 100 particles per sample. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was executed simultaneously with SEM observations for chosen regions of the samples.\n\n## Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)\nFourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was performed using a Vertex 80 V FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, USA) equipped with a Platinum ATR module (Bruker, USA). Tea extracts were dried by rotary evaporation at 65 \u00b0C to remove water, while G-TeaNPs were centrifuged to eliminate residual water and subsequently dried in an oven at 65 \u00b0C. The dried powder samples were placed onto a diamond prism (1 mm \u00d7\u20091 mm) to ensure complete coverage. Spectral measurements were conducted at a resolution of 2\u00a0cm\u22121, with a total of 64 scans collected per sample.\n\n## PXRD\nX-ray diffraction analysis was performed with a Malvern PANalytical Empyrean range diffractometer at room temperature, with a wavelength \u03bb\u2009= 0.154 nm.\n\n## Bacteriophage-AgNP cocktails against bacterial pathogens\nThe bacteria were cultured according to the plating method protocol. The overnight cultures were refreshed by adding 7.5 mL of fresh LB medium to 2.5 mL of overnight culture and incubated for one hour at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the refreshed cultures were both diluted with LB to reach an optical density of around OD600\u2009= 1.0 for Salmonella enterica DSM 18552 (about 8.0 \u00d7\u2009108\u00a0CFU/mL) (colony-forming units per mL), OD600\u2009= 1.0 for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 (about 5.0 \u00d7\u2009109\u00a0CFU/mL). Afterward, the bacteria were centrifuged (10 min, 8200 RPM) and suspended in a PBS buffer solution to reach the initial concentration of 105\u00a0CFU/mL. Then, bacteria were exposed to varying rates of infection (ROI) of adequate phages (P22, vB_SauS_CS1) of 1, 10, and 100, and concentrations of G-TeaNPs ranging from 0.1 to 0.0001 mg/mL. Both P22 and vB_SauS_CS1 were purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures.\nThe survival rate was evaluated after 3\u00a0h of incubation with mixing (220 RPM, 37 \u00b0C). After the incubation, 100 mL of each sample was placed onto the fresh LB agar plates. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the number of bacteria was calculated based on the colony number, according to the equation CFU per mL =\u2009N \u00d7\u2009D \u00d7\u200910 (N \u2013 number of colonies; D \u2013 dilution).\n\n## Toxicity assay on Acanthamoeba castellanii\nThe cytotoxic effect of reagents such as AgNPs, G-TeaNPs, and green tea extract was tested in vitro on strain 309 of A. castellanii T4 genotype (isolated from the environment (Kasprzak and Mazur 1978)). Amoeba strains were cultured axenically on Bacto-Casitone liquid medium +\u2009horse serum as described by \u010cerv (L. 1969). Amoeba cultures were established on polystyrene plates (Nest Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Non-Pyrogenic) with 24 wells. One milliliter of cell suspension was added to the wells, and 1\u00a0mL of reagent containing a concentration of AgNPs, green tea extract, and G-TeaNPs to achieve the target dilution. Reagents were added to the axenic amoeba culture (5 \u00d7\u2009104 cells/mL) in the following concentrations: 0.05, 0.1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/mL. The increase or decrease in the number of amoebae was checked at 48-h intervals using Thom\u2019s hemocytometer chamber. The control group was a culture of amoebae without reagents (Derda et al. 2016). The minimum concentration of reagents that inhibited the growth of the amoeba culture was determined. The test was performed in 3 replicates for the same batch of particles, up to 7\u00a0days, of cultures stored at 28 \u00b0C in a humid and dark chamber.\n\n## Transmission electron microscope (TEM) imaging\nThe cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, overnight at room temperature. Samples were washed in cacodylate buffer thrice and stained with 1% osmium tetroxide in ddH2O overnight at room temperature. Samples were then washed in ddH2O and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 96%, absolute ethanol, and acetone). Samples were embedded in epon resin (SERVA) and polymerized for 24 h at 60 \u00b0C in an incubator (Agar Scientific, England). Next, 70 nm sections were cut with a diamond knife on RMC MTXL ultramicrotome (RMC Boeckeler Instruments, USA). The sections on copper grids were not contrasted. Samples were analyzed using a LIBRA 120 transmission electron microscope produced by Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) at 120 keV. Photographs were made with a Slow-Scan CCD camera (ProScan, Germany) using the EsiVision Pro 3.2 software.\n\n## Cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells\nThe biocompatibility of modified gold nanoparticles was assessed using the Alamar Blue assay using 3\u2009T3 NIH fibroblast cells. All reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers: AlamarBlue reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific), Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), and Trypan Blue (ThermoFisher Scientific). 3\u2009T3 NIH fibroblast cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured upon reaching 70\u201380% confluency and harvested for experiments during the log phase of growth. Cells were harvested and counted using Trypan Blue exclusion to ensure viable cell counts. Cells were diluted to a concentration of 7.5 \u00d7\u200910 cells/mL, and 200 \u03bcL of cell suspension (equivalent to 1.5 \u00d7\u2009104 cells) was seeded into each well of a 96-well tissue culture-treated plate. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 to allow for surface attachment. Cells were treated with nanoparticles at a 0.1 mg/mL concentration the following day. The cells were incubated with the nanoparticles for 24 and 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. After each incubation period, the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh medium containing 10% (v/v) Alamar Blue solution. The cells were incubated with the AlamarBlue mixture for 4\u00a0h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. After incubation, 150 \u03bcL of the medium from each well was transferred to a new 96-well plate, and fluorescence was measured using a plate reader with excitation at 530\u2014570 nm and emission at 580\u2013620 nm. The blank value (from wells without cells) was subtracted from each reading to ensure accuracy. Cell viability was calculated based on metabolic activity, which was directly proportional to the Alamar Blue fluorescence intensity.\nCytotoxicity tests were also performed using MTT proliferation/metabolic activity assays, as described in the Supplementary Information.\n\n## Analysis of the data\nAll the experiments were performed in triplicate (n\u2009= 3). The error bars were plotted as the standard error of measurement (SEM). The statistical analysis was performed using a t-test, with statistical significance marked as follows: ***p\u2009< 0.001, **p\u2009< 0.01, *p\u2009< 0.05. Otherwise, the differences were not significant (ns). In the Alamar blue cytotoxicity assay, where two independent variables (nanoparticle type and concentration) were involved, we employed a two-way ANOVA analysis; statistical significance was marked similarly as in the case of the t-test.\n\n## Characterization of G-TeaNPs\nThe SEM image of the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) capped with green tea extract (G-TeaNPs) revealed their morphology, with agglomerates bound by a thin layer likely originating from the tea extract coating (Fig.\u00a01a). The size distribution of the nanoparticles (Fig.\u00a01a, insert) showed that most particles fell within the 40\u201350-nm range. However, a noticeable deviation from a normal distribution was observed due to an overrepresentation of particles around ~\u200920 nm. The average particle diameter was calculated to be 45.6 \u00b1\u200915.6 nm. This irregular size distribution was consistent with findings from our previous study, where G-TeaNPs\u2019 efficacy against bacteria was evaluated (Raza et al. 2023). DLS measurements revealed the hydrodynamic diameter to be around 60\u201370 nm, which is in line with SEM. Zeta potential was negative. Detailed distributions of hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potentials are provided in the Supplementary Information (Figure S4).Fig. 1a SEM image of G-TeaNPs (silver nanoparticles synthesized using green tea extract), inset: size distribution (diameter), line\u2014kernel density. b Diffractogram of AgNPs capped with green tea extract. c FTIR spectra of G-TeaNPs and d green tea extract\nThe nanoparticles were further analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), revealing spectral features consistent with those reported in our previous study (Fig.\u00a01c and d). A broad band in the 3000\u20133600 cm\u22121 range, characteristic of O\u2013H stretching, was observed. This band is typical of alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids commonly found in tea extract components, and possibly due to adsorbed water molecules. Additional prominent bands included C\u2013H stretching (2850\u20132950 cm\u22121), C\u2009= O stretching (1700\u20131750 cm\u22121), C\u2009= C stretching (1620\u20131680 cm\u22121), N\u2013H bending (1500\u20131600 cm\u22121), and C\u2013O stretching (1050\u20131300 cm\u22121). These bands corresponded to functional groups commonly found in tea extract constituents, such as catechins, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and amino acids. Notably, except for the broad O\u2013H stretching band, the same characteristic peaks were observed in the FTIR spectrum of the G-TeaNPs, confirming the successful capping of nanoparticles by the tea extract components.\nEnergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed on the AgNPs sample, with the Si substrate used as a reference background. The analysis confirmed the presence of silver in the sample (Figure S1). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the sample displayed a characteristic diffractogram of AgNPs, i.e., the face-centered cubic crystalline structure of metallic silver (JCPDS 01\u2013071\u20134613) (Fig.\u00a01b). Using Scherrer\u2019s equation, the crystallite size was calculated from the four prominent diffraction peaks (with a shape factor of 0.94), yielding an average size of 19.8 \u00b1\u20093.4 nm. This suggests that a significant portion of the nanoparticles were not single crystals, which might also account for the overrepresentation of ~\u200920 nm particles observed in the size distribution analysis. We also analyzed two peaks at 32.0\u00b0 and 35.9\u00b0 of low intensity. They were associated with the highly intense peaks of silver oxide species, such as Ag2O, AgO, and Ag2O3 (Ando et al. 2012). These findings indicated that the oxidation of the silver nanoparticles during synthesis or storage was minimal.\n\n## Antimicrobial activity of G-TeaNPs\nBefore testing phage/nanoparticle cocktails against pathogenic bacteria, evaluating the potential effects of the nanoparticles (NPs) on phages is essential. Figure S2 confirmed that our nanoparticles exhibited no significant inactivation effects on the tested phages. Taking into account \u201cthe experimental effect,\u201d we subjectively acknowledged the decrease in phage titer >\u20091 log as the antiviral activity. While LR1_PAO1 showed a minor reduction of approximately 0.5 log compared to the control group containing only phages, there was no observable difference between the effects of citrate-capped nanoparticles and tea-based nanoparticles on LR1_PAO1. This suggested that any slight reduction in PFU/mL was not attributable to the functionalization of the tea extract. For T4 and Phi6, no measurable decrease in phage activity was observed for any of the tested nanoparticles, indicating the lack of antiviral activity of AgNPs, including the G-TeaNPs, against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. These results indicated that the nanoparticles, whether citrate-capped or tea-capped, did not possess phage-inactivating properties, supporting their compatibility for further testing in phage/nanoparticle combinations targeting pathogenic bacteria. We proceeded to test phage/nanoparticle cocktails using green tea silver nanoparticles. G-TeaNPs were previously identified as the most effective against bacteria and fungi among a series of silver particles prepared with extracts from various teas (Raza et al. 2023).\nFor the novel phage/NP cocktails, we selected S. enterica, one of the most frequently occurring foodborne pathogens (a gram-negative bacterium), and a methicillin-resistant strain of S. aureus (MRSA; a gram-positive bacterium). The efficacy of these combinations was assessed across a range of rates of infection (ROI, representing the ratio of phages to bacterial cells) and concentrations. In Fig.\u00a02a, ROI =\u20091 was kept constant, but the concentration of G-TeaNPs varied from 0.1 mg/mL to 0.0001 mg/mL. Figure\u00a02 b shows the results of experiments where the concentration of G-TeaNPs was constant (0.001 mg/mL), but ROIs varied from 1 to 100.Fig. 2Antibacterial activity of phage/nanoparticle (phage/NP) cocktails and phage/antibiotic combinations against S. aureus (gram-positive) and S. enterica (gram-negative). a Bacterial survival after treatment with G-TeaNPs (0.1 mg/mL to 0.0001 mg/mL) combined with P22 (S. enterica) or vB_SauS_CS1 (S. aureus) bacteriophages (ROI =\u20091). b Effect of phage/NP cocktails ([G-TeaNPs] =\u20090.001 mg/mL) at different rates of infection (ROI =\u20091 to 100). c Comparison of bacterial survival following treatment with ampicillin (AMP) alone or in combination with bacteriophages at varying ROIs\nAdding phages at an ROI =\u200910 or higher significantly enhanced antibacterial effects, allowing for a substantial reduction in the required working concentrations of G-TeaNPs. Specifically, with phages at ROI =\u200910, the bacterial survival rate decreased to 10\u201320%, depending on the species, even when the concentration of G-TeaNPs was as low as 0.001 mg/mL (1 \u03bcg/mL). In contrast, a similar efficacy with G-TeaNPs alone required a 100 times higher concentration (0.1 mg/mL).\nFor comparison with commonly used phage/antibiotic cocktails, we tested the combined effects of bacteriophages and ampicillin (AMP) against S. aureus and S. enterica across various rates of infection (ROIs). The results showed that the AMP-phage combination was more effective against S. aureus (Fig.\u00a02d) compared to S. enterica. Specifically, AMP alone reduced S. aureus survival to approximately 60%, while adding phages further reduced survival to around 30% at ROI 10 and 25% at ROI 100. In the case of S. enterica, the impact of the AMP-phage combination was less pronounced but still significant. AMP alone decreased bacterial survival to approximately 75%. Adding phages reduced survival to around 70% (AMP +\u2009ROI 1) and 58% (AMP +\u2009ROI 100). Notably, the phage/NP cocktails at ROIs 10 and 100 achieved far greater reductions in survival, with bacterial survival rates dropping to approximately 10%.\nThe overall efficacy of the AMP-phage combination was similar to or worse than that of the phage/NP cocktails. This might be crucial when fighting multidrug-resistant bacteria, where antibiotics are inefficient and novel agents are needed. We also underline that these results were obtained after only 3\u00a0h of incubation.\n\n## Cytotoxicity towards amoebae and mammalian cells\nTo assess potential environmental impacts and effects on free-living unicellular organisms, Acanthamoeba castellanii was used as a model organism. Amoebae were exposed to tea extracts, citrate-capped AgNPs, and G-TeaNPs for seven days, with live amoebae counts taken every two days (Fig.\u00a03d). The experiments revealed that G-TeaNPs were ineffective against A. castellanii at low concentrations. Depending on the batch of particles, up to 5\u00a0mg/mL did not affect amoebae. In the case of the specific batch shown here, the lowest concentration inhibiting the growth was 10 mg/mL, a dose approximately 16 times higher than the cytotoxic threshold for mammalian cells. Interestingly, no clear correlation was observed between G-TeaNP concentration and the formation of amoebae cysts. Surprisingly, green tea extracts alone were as effective in inhibiting amoebae growth as G-TeaNPs, a phenomenon not observed in antibacterial assays.Fig. 3a Control cells of A. castellanii, non-exposed to G-TeaNPs. b\nA. castellanii exposed to G-TeaNPs, showing nanoparticle uptake and accumulation within intracellular vacuoles, compared to control cells. c Cells exposed to G-TeaNPs exhibit increased vacuolization and morphological changes: (1) trophozoites, (2) trophozoite vacuoles filled with AgNPs, and (3) cysts containing AgNPs. Similar vacuolization and size/shape reduction were observed in cells treated with green tea extract but without nanoparticle accumulation. These findings highlight the cellular uptake of nanoparticles and their potential influence on A. castellanii morphology. d Cytotoxic effects of citrate-capped C-AgNPs, G-TeaNPs, and green tea extract (GT) on A. castellanii over 7\u00a0days. G-TeaNPs inhibited amoebae growth only at high concentrations, while lower concentrations (i.e., 0.1 mg/mL as used in the other assays) were ineffective. GT alone was as effective as G-TeaNPs in reducing amoebae counts\nTransmission electron microscopy confirmed that A. castellanii actively phagocytosed the nanoparticles, accumulating within intracellular vacuoles (Fig.\u00a03b). Light microscopy further revealed distinct morphological changes in both live amoebae and cysts after exposure to G-TeaNPs (Fig.\u00a03c). Specifically, trophozoites and cysts were visibly filled with AgNPs within their vacuoles after five days of exposure. Exposure to green tea extract alone also induced noticeable reductions in cell size and shape and increased vacuolization, similar to what was observed in cells treated with G-TeaNPs. However, no nanoparticle accumulation was observed in the case of green tea extract.\nThe control sample showed normal A. castellanii forms, including moving trophozoites, resting trophozoites, and cysts, while cells exposed to G-TeaNPs display increased vacuolization, with AgNPs accumulating inside trophozoites and cysts. Similar vacuolization and morphological changes were observed in cells treated with green tea extract, although without the visible presence of nanoparticles.\nThese findings highlight the cellular uptake of nanoparticles by A. castellanii and their potential influence on amoebae morphology. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of green tea extract on A. castellanii raises questions about its mechanism of action, independent of nanoparticles, and its broader implications for environmental and biological systems. Importantly, these results also underscore the species-specific effects of G-TeaNPs, with significant differences in cytotoxicity between mammalian cells and amoebae.\nTo evaluate the biocompatibility of G-TeaNPs nanoparticles, an Alamar Blue assay was conducted using the 3\u2009T3 NIH fibroblast cell line. Two types of nanoparticles were tested: citrate-capped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and G-TeaNPs. The chosen concentrations were 1\u00a0mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL, based on their effective antibacterial activity.\n3 T3 NIH cells were treated with different nanoparticle formulations, including AgNPs and G-TeaNPs, for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using the Alamar Blue assay, which measured the conversion of resazurin to its fluorescent product, resorufin. The quantitative results in Fig.\u00a04f demonstrate that cell viability exceeded 80% for G-TeaNPs at 0.1 mg/mL, while that of AgNPs remained below 60%. At 1\u00a0mg/mL, both the nanoparticles showed cell viability below 5%.Fig. 4Optical microscopic images of 3\u2009T3 NIH fibroblast cells after 24 h of incubation with different nanoparticle treatments: a untreated control cells. b Cells treated with 1% Triton X as a negative control. c Cells treated with only AlamarBlue (positive control). d Cells treated with control silver nanoparticles (C-AgNPs, 0.1 mg/mL), d) Cells treated with G-TeaNPs (0.1 mg/mL). e Viability of cells treated with AgNPs and G-TeaNPs after 24 h of incubation at 1\u00a0mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL. f The survival of the fibroblasts after exposure to control AgNPs and G-TeaNPs at the",
