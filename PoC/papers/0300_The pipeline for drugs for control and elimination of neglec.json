  "title": "The pipeline for drugs for control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases: 2. Oral anti-infective drugs and drug combinations for off-label use.",
  "abstract": "In its 'Road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021-2030', the World Health Organization outlined its targets for control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and research needed to achieve them. For many NTDs, this includes research for new treatment options for case management and/or preventive chemotherapy. Our review of small-molecule anti-infective drugs recently approved by a stringent regulatory authority (SRA) or in at least Phase 2 clinical development for regulatory approval showed that this pipeline cannot deliver all new treatments needed. WHO guidelines and country policies show that drugs may be recommended for control and elimination for NTDs for which they are not SRA approved (i.e. for 'off-label' use) if efficacy and safety data for the relevant NTD are considered sufficient by WHO and country authorities. Here, we are providing an overview of clinical research in the past 10 years evaluating the anti-infective efficacy of oral small-molecule drugs for NTD(s) for which they are neither SRA approved, nor included in current WHO strategies nor, considering the research sponsors, likely to be registered with a SRA for that NTD, if found to be effective and safe. No such research has been done for yaws, guinea worm, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), rabies, trachoma, visceral leishmaniasis, mycetoma, T. b. rhodesiense HAT, echinococcosis, taeniasis/cysticercosis or scabies. Oral drugs evaluated include sparfloxacin and acedapsone for leprosy; rifampicin, rifapentin and moxifloxacin for onchocerciasis; imatinib and levamisole for loiasis; itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole and disulfiram for Chagas disease, doxycycline and rifampicin for lymphatic filariasis; arterolane, piperaquine, artesunate, artemether, lumefantrine and mefloquine for schistosomiasis; ivermectin, tribendimidine, pyrantel, oxantel and nitazoxanide for soil-transmitted helminths including strongyloidiasis; chloroquine, ivermectin, balapiravir, ribavirin, celgosivir, UV-4B, ivermectin and doxycycline for dengue; streptomycin, amoxicillin, clavulanate for Buruli ulcer; fluconazole and isavuconazonium for mycoses; clarithromycin and dapsone for cutaneous leishmaniasis; and tribendimidine, albendazole, mebendazole and nitazoxanide for foodborne trematodiasis. Additional paths to identification of new treatment options are needed. One promising path is exploitation of the worldwide experience with 'off-label' treatment of diseases with insufficient treatment options as pursued by the 'CURE ID' initiative.",

  "full_text": "## Background\nAround 1 billion people, primarily in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), are affected by Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) [1]. In 2020, WHO provided an overview of current strategic interventions and new tools and approaches needed to achieve the targets laid out in its 2021\u20132030 roadmap for NTDs (the \u2018Roadmap\u2019) [1]. New tools needed include, but are not limited to, new drugs, optimized drug regimens and/or new formulations.\nWe have previously provided an overview of new small-molecule anti-infective molecular entities (drugs) in the pipeline for NTD control and elimination strategies which have recently been approved by a regulatory authority for treatment of an NTD or are in at least Phase 2 clinical development for regulatory approval for an NTD [2]. Research and development (R&D) of new drugs comes with a significant risk of failure and it takes many years even from initiation of Phase 2 clinical development to the first regulatory agency approval (registration). R&D for new drugs also requires significant financial resources to achieve regulatory registration and further resources to maintain the registration [3]. Furthermore, studies beyond those that supported regulatory approval may be needed to provide the basis for inclusion of the new drug in WHO guidelines, country policies and practice [2].\nRepurposing (also referred to as \u2018reprofiling\u2019 or \u2018repositioning\u2019) drugs already registered provides a cheaper, less risky and faster path to new treatment options. Repurposing of registered veterinary drugs for human use led to a number of drugs used today for NTDs [2]. Repurposing of drugs registered for one indication in humans for another indication can provide an even cheaper, less risky and faster pathway to new treatment options: the pre-clinical toxicology profile is known, a formulation for human use is available, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of the drug in healthy volunteers and the potential for drug-drug interactions have been characterized and data are available on the safety profile of the drug in the approved indication(s) with the approved formulation(s) and dosing regimen(s). Therefore, repurposing drugs approved for indication(s) in humans can, in most cases, be initiated with Phase 2 studies with the available formulation to obtain proof of concept for efficacy in the new indication and identify a dose regimen to be evaluated in Phase 3 studies. The Phase 3 studies will be designed to establish the efficacy with acceptable statistical significance and to better characterize the safety profile of the chosen regimen in the targeted indication. Depending on the intended use context, these studies may have to be followed by additional larger scale studies to support guidelines and policies and by implementation research as is often necessary for new drugs [2].\nAvailability of efficacy and safety data for an indication may qualify the drug for inclusion in guidelines and policies even if the drug is not registered for the new indication, i.e. will be used \u2018off-label\u2019. Some WHO guidelines for \u2018Preventive Chemotherapy\u2019 (PC, i.e. drug administration to specified populations irrespective of the presence of symptoms or infection; for an overview of WHO guidelines see supplementary information in [2]) include drugs and drug combinations which have not been registered for the disease for which WHO recommends their use during PC. An example is PC for elimination of LF as a public health problem: in onchocerciasis co-endemic countries albendazole combined with ivermectin is recommended, in countries where onchocerciasis is not co-endemic albendazole combined with diethylcarbamazine or with diethylcarbamazine and ivermectin is recommended and in Loa loa co-endemic areas PC with albendazole alone is recommended [1, 2, 4, 5]. The basis for the introduction of albendazole\u2009+\u2009ivermectin and albendazole\u2009+\u2009diethylcarbamazine for PC of LF was studies on the effect of ivermectin on LF microfilaraemia as well as large-scale studies on the safety of the combination treatments conducted to support a potential WHO guideline as per WHO expert consultations [6\u20138]. LF is an indication for ivermectin (under the brand name Mectizan) in the prescribing information (label) authorized by the French Regulatory Authority (Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament et des produits de sant\u00e9) [9] but not in the prescribing information authorized for ivermectin (under the brandname Stromectol) by the US FDA. To our knowledge, indications for albendazole by national regulatory authorities may include strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis and infections with Echinococcus granulosus, Enterobius vermicularis, Giardia intestinalis, G. duodenalis, Taenia solium, T. saginata, Trichinella spiralis or hookworm infections but not LF. LF was recently included among ivermectin and albendazole indications for products prequalified by the WHO Prequalification Programme [10, 11]. For another ivermectin product, prequalified via the abbreviated prequalification process for products approved by stringent regulatory authorities (SRA [12]) in this case the US FDA [13, 14]), the prescribing information is that approved by the US FDA, i.e. does not include LF. However, the WHO Prequalification Programme specifies in Part 1 of the documentation that WHO recommended uses include LF, scabies, strongyloidiasis and, when administered with albendazole, soil-transmitted intestinal worm infections [15].\nHere, we provide an overview of clinical studies for repurposing small-molecule anti-infective drugs, as mono- or combination treatment, for an NTD. This research is driven primarily by two concerns: (1) potential development of resistance when current strategies are based on the use of a single drug and (2) inadequate efficacy or safety of available drugs/drug combinations. Both could be addressed by new treatment options with repurposed drugs including combination treatment.\nWe included clinical research which meets the following criteria:The drugs evaluated are approved for human use and administered orally;The drugs have not received regulatory approval for the NTD for which they are being clinically evaluated and/or are not included in current NTD control and elimination strategies as per the Roadmap for the NTD for which their efficacy was evaluated [1, 2];Based on the study sponsors, submission of an application for regulatory registration for the NTD should the research show that the drug is efficacious and safe for the new NTD indication appears unlikely, i.e. potential use would be off-label;The anti-infective effect was evaluated.\nWe did not consider co-administration of different drugs in view of integration of current strategies for different diseases as \u2018combination treatment\u2019; consequently, relevant studies are not included. Unless previously provided by us [2] or in recent reviews by others, we are summarizing basic information on the drugs, prior research that motivated repurposing and the main conclusions to date.\nFor information on regulatory approval, we searched first for registration in the US for the following reasons: (1) given the characteristics of the US market, the probability of registration for indications present in the US population is highest, and even drugs for indications not endemic in the US may be registered in the US (e.g. ivermectin for onchocerciasis), (2) the US FDA website provides an excellent, easy-to-search data base on approved drugs [16]. The data base includes current US FDA approved labelling (prescribing information), past labelling and for many drugs the very informative assessment of the US FDA reviewers at the time of the original registration. When needed, we also searched the websites of other SRAs that provide detailed product information with reviewer assessment (European Medicines Agency, the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). Search of the websites of other SRAs (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, Swissmedic, Health Canada, Australia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway [12]) was not necessary.\nClinical studies were identified through search of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for studies registered in a clinical trials platform in the past approximately 10 years. Additional file 1: Table S1 shows the ICTRP source registries and last data file import date into the ICTRP as of the search date of 8 February 2023. For studies for which the literature search identified no publications, we accessed the source registry file for any update on the study status. We excluded studies with records that had not been updated for 2 years after the study completion date (as provided in the record or estimated based on recruitment start and study duration) or for 3 years if the information in the record was insufficient to estimate the study completion date. Studies completed as per the source registry but for which we could not identify a publication as well as ongoing and planned studies are included in Table 1. Table 2 provides an overview of the drugs meeting our inclusion for this manuscript combined with those we reviewed previously [2] together with the drugs in current WHO-recommended strategies and the needs for improved treatment options WHO identified in the Roadmap.Table 1Planned, ongoing or unpublished completed studies in the ICTRP as of 8 February 2023 evaluating small-molecule anti-infective

Given the contribution of traditional medicines to drugs in use today (e.g. the artemisinins for malaria [17]) and WHO initiatives to harness such knowledge [18, 19], following the literature for results of these studies will be interesting. For some plant extracts/traditional medicines being evaluated, we included information in Additional file 1.\nAs for our previous review of drugs in the pipeline for regulatory approval [2], we wanted to ensure to the best of our ability that readers in LMIC can access all references. Therefore, all references are either openly accessible (open access or accessible as author manuscripts e.g. via the US National Institutes of Health\u2019s National Library of Medicine platform (Pubmed Central, PMC), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory European Bioinformatics Institute platform (Europe PMC) or institutional websites, or publications in the WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (WHO IRIS)) or were accessible via HINARI to the WHO staff co-author (ACK). HINARI is a WHO initiative through which not-for-profit institutions in LMIC can obtain free or low cost online access to major journals in the biomedical and related social sciences [20]. Publishers do not provide the same access to the publications in HINARI to all eligible institutions. WHO has a relatively limited level of access and we used WHO staff (ACK) access as the criterion for \u2018accessible via HINARI\u2019. Our objective to minimize differences in access to references between readers from rich institutions in high income countries and all other readers has resulted in some relevant literature not being referenced. Hopefully, in the context of increasing attention to Open Access, all journals will, at a minimum, make all content more than 2\u00a0years old accessible to all HINARI eligible institutions.\n\n## NTDs targeted for eradication\nIn the Roadmap, WHO defines eradication as: \u2018Permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific pathogen, as a result of deliberate efforts, with no risk of reintroduction\u2019. Documentation of eradication is termed certification [1].\n\n## Yaws\nThe current strategy is based on PC with azithromycin. For case management, azithromycin is the preferred treatment and benzathine benzylpenicillin the treatment for patients who are suspected to have failed azithromycin treatment and those who cannot be treated with azithromycin [1, 2].\nNo drugs not already part of current strategies have been evaluated for efficacy against yaws in the past 10\u00a0years, and no trials\u00a0are ongoing or planned as of the records in the ICTRP on 8 February 2023.\n\n## Guinea worm\nThe current strategy for guinea worm eradication is based on safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) [1, 2].\nNo drugs have been clinically evaluated for guinea worm in the past 10\u00a0years and no trials are planned as per the records in the ICTRP on 8 February 2023.\n\n## NTDs targeted for elimination (interruption of transmission)\nIn the Roadmap, WHO defines \u2018Elimination (interruption of transmission)\u2019 as \u2018Reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific pathogen in a defined geographical area, with minimal risk of reintroduction, as a result of deliberate efforts; continued action to prevent re-establishment of transmission may be required\u2019. Documentation of elimination of transmission is termed verification [1].\n\n## Leprosy\nDrugs currently recommended for case management include rifampicin, dapsone, clofazimine, clarithromycin, minocycline or a quinolone (ofloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin). Rifampicin is recommended for chemoprophylaxis [1, 2].\nA recent systematic review identified no regimens better than the WHO recommended regimens. With the exception of regimens including sparfloxacin or acedapsone, all regimens evaluated were based on drugs already recommended by WHO [21]. Our ICTRP search on 8 February 2023 did not identify studies with other drugs for potential off-label use.\n\n## Human African trypanosomiasis due to \nThe drugs currently recommended for case management include fexinidazole, eflornithine-nifurtimox combination and pentamidine [1, 2].\nNo trials with other drugs or not conducted in view of regulatory registration [2] have been conducted in the past 10\u00a0years, are currently ongoing or planned as per the records in the ICTRP on 8 February 2023.\n\n## Onchocerciasis\nThe current strategy for elimination of transmission of Onchocerca volvulus is based on PC with ivermectin [1, 2].\n\n## Ivermectin-albendazole and ivermectin-diethylcarbamazine-albendazole combination\nAddition of albendazole to bi-annual or annual single-dose ivermectin treatment did not significantly affect the proportion of adult female worms with normal embryogenesis, dead macrofilariae or of individuals with detectable skin microfilariae levels (ISRCTN50035143, Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT03238131) [29].\nThe superiority of ivermectin-diethylcarbamazine-albendazole over diethylcarbamazine-albendazole for LF resulted in a conditional WHO recommendation for use of this combination for LF elimination in specified situations and where neither onchocerciasis nor loiasis is endemic [4]. A pilot-study evaluating ivermectin-diethylcarbamazine-albendazole treatment of O. volvulus-infected individuals completed collection of the data for the primary outcome (rates of severe adverse events (AEs) and percentage of worms killed/sterilized) in January 2022. Macrofilariae evaluation is ongoing (NCT04188301, Pan African Clinical Trials Registry identifier (PACTRI) PACTR201906665550709) [30]. Eligible individuals were treated 6\u00a0months earlier with ivermectin to reduce microfilariae levels and thus the probability of adverse reactions to diethylcarbamazine [31]. The severity of such reactions is a function of pre-treatment microfilaria levels and diethylcarbamazine dose [32\u201334].\n\n## Antibiotics targeting the \nResearch into the role of endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria in development of filarial parasites (O. volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, B. timori, Mansonella perstans) and the effect of antibiotics on their fertility and viability dates back to the 1990s [35]. Clinical proof of concept for the utility of targeting Wolbachia for treatment of filarial infections was obtained with doxycycline for O. volvulus: Wolbachia depletion 6\u00a0months after 4 or 6 weeks of treatment with 200 mg or 100\u00a0mg doxycycline/day was a predictor of female O. volvulus worm death or sterility [36\u201341].\nThe long doxycycline treatment duration required is a challenge for large-scale use outside clinical or pilot implementation studies. Furthermore, neither onchocerciasis nor LF meets current doxycycline labelling criteria for use in children\u2009<\u20099\u00a0years, pregnant or breastfeeding women which\u00a0have been questioned for young children and pregnant women [42]. These factors continue to drive evaluation of other antibiotics already approved for human use including minocycline [43, 44] and rifapentine-moxifloxacin combination treatment [45] as well as discovery of new antibiotics and preclinical and clinical development of emerging drug candidates. This research has recently been reviewed [2, 22].\nRifampicin and rifapentine are rifamycins and ansamycins developed in the 1960s. They are active against gram-positive and, to a lesser extent, gram-negative bacteria and are an important element of multi-drug tuberculosis treatment. Rifamycins block the early stages of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis [46].\nRifapentine-moxifloxacin combination: Based on animal model results [47], an open label, proof-of-concept phase 2 trial evaluated the Wolbachia depleting effect of 7 or 14\u00a0days of moxifloxacin 400\u00a0mg/day\u2009+\u2009rifapentine 900\u00a0mg/day in Ghana (ISRCTN43697583).\nRifampicin: In a proof-of-concept study, 10\u00a0mg/kg/day rifampicin for 2 (n\u2009=\u200912) or 4 (n\u2009=\u200916) weeks resulted in 0% (0/23) and 18% (2/11) live macrofilariae without Wolbachia 18\u00a0months after treatment compared to 1% (1/88) in the concurrent untreated control and 82% (9/11) in a historical 6-week 100\u00a0mg/day doxycycline control [48]. Considering the dose-response relationship in animal models [49] and the tolerability of rifampicin up to 35\u00a0mg/kg [50], two trials evaluating the efficacy of rifampicin in combination with albendazole for both onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis were initiated (Table 1).\n\n## Drugs for safe reduction of \nIvermectin mass drug administration is currently the main strategy for control and elimination of onchocerciasis and ivermectin is also a component of the strategy for control and elimination of LF. Since ivermectin can result in severe and potentially deadly adverse reactions in individuals with high Loa loa microfilaraemia [51], loiasis co-endemicity is a significant obstacle to elimination of O. volvulus transmission and elimination of LF as a public health problem in loiasis co-endemic areas in Africa [52].
