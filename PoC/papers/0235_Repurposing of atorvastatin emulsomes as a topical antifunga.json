  "title": "Repurposing of atorvastatin emulsomes as a topical antifungal agent.",
  "abstract": "Cutaneous fungal infection therapy confronts several issues concerning skin permeation in addition to drug resistance and adverse effects of conventional drugs. The repurposing strategy is supposed to overcome some of those therapeutic obstacles. Recently, atorvastatin (ATO) revealed antifungal activity. ATO is an antihyperlipidemic drug with pH-dependent solubility, which limits skin permeation. This study aims to improve ATO antifungal activity by encapsulation in an emulsomes (EMLs) system, which seeks to ameliorate skin penetration. Therefore, multiple factors were investigated according to the One-Factor-at-a-Time (OFAT) design to achieve the optimum formula with targeted characteristics. Minimizing particle-size and polydispersity-index, besides elevating zeta-potential (ZP) and entrapment-efficiency were the desirable responses during assessing 11 factors. The selected ATO-EMLs formula (E21) recorded 250.5\u2009nm in particle size, polydispersity index of 0.4, ZP of -25.93\u2009mV, and 83.12% of drug entrapped. Morphological study of E21 revealed spherical core-shell vesicles in nanosize. DSC, XRD, and FTIR were conducted to discover the physicochemical properties and confirm emulsomes formation. Optimized ATO-EMLs slowed drug release rate as only 75% of ATO was released after 72\u2009h. Stability study recommended storage between 2 and 8\u2009\u00b0C. The in vivo permeation study remarked a homogeneous penetration of EMLs in different skin layers. The in vivo skin irritation test revealed limited histopathological changes. The in vitro and in vivo microbiological studies demonstrated a good antifungal activity of ATO-EMLs. ATO-EMLs system improved antifungal activity as the MIC values reduced from 650\u2009\u00b5g/mL for free ATO to 550\u2009\u00b5g/mL for ATO-EMLs. These findings may shed light on ATO as an antifungal drug and nanosystems as a tool to support drug repurposing.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nFungal infections are one of the highly insecure health issues faced by healthcare professionals. Statistics recorded about 13 million infections and \u223c1.5 million deaths worldwide yearly. One of the main causes of this alarming rate is the noticeable elevation in the immunocompromised patient population (Rayens & Norris, 2022). Candidiasis is one of the most prevalent diseases affecting patients globally, including various types such as mucosal candidiasis, systemic candidiasis, vaginal candidiasis, and cutaneous candidiasis (Kauffman et\u00a0al., 2011). Cutaneous candidiasis can be treated with several antifungal classes such as azole, allylamine, and polyene antifungals. Nowadays drug resistance and adverse effects are revealed as an obvious challenge for those conventional antifungal drugs. Therefore, prospective studies and drug development are in demand (de Oliveira Santos et\u00a0al., 2018).\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, establishing a new drug is a complicated, costly, and time-consuming process. According to the food and drug administration (FDA), the drug development process generally undergoes four stages before marketing including discovery and development, preclinical, and clinical research. FDA reviews all those stages over 12\u201315\u2009years (Hughes et\u00a0al., 2011). A new strategy termed drug repurposing \u2018repositioning\u2019 was useful to overcome the lengthy drug discovery process. Repurposing implies the ability to investigate new therapeutic uses for previously approved drugs with different utilization scopes (Pushpakom et\u00a0al., 2019). Recently, this strategy is widely used effectively in oncology, cardiology, mycology, and other diseases (Peyclit et\u00a0al., 2021). Many drug classes were investigated for antifungal efficacy, and chosen as useful alternative common drugs (Mir\u00f3-Canturri et\u00a0al., 2019; Kim et\u00a0al., 2020).\nStatins are a recognized group of drugs that are primarily used as plasma cholesterol-lowering agents upon inhibiting the hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme (Sirtori, 2014). New studies on statins realized new therapeutic fields such as cancer therapy (Jiang et\u00a0al., 2021), antibacterial (Ko et\u00a0al., 2018), and antifungal treatment. Tavakkoli et\u00a0al. showed the antifungal effects of statins against wide pathogenic species and reported that the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme was also revealed as a fungal enzyme; so, it will expose to inhibition by statins, which leads to fungal growth suppression due to ergosterol level decline (Tavakkoli et\u00a0al., 2020). Atorvastatin (ATO) was reported as one of the statin categories effectively involved in antifungal therapeutic studies as it was investigated previously against Candida albicans (Nasr Esfahani et\u00a0al., 2019). ATO-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles were reported to promote drug permeation through skin layers for anti-inflammatory activity (Shahraeini et\u00a0al., 2020).\nVesicle nanocarriers possess distinctive features as topical drug delivery. Vesicle size allows drug penetration through skin layers and provides a controlled drug release (Sinico & Fadda, 2009). Liposomes are the first established system that was developed for topical and transdermal drug delivery. However, different modifications were investigated to improve its stability and delivery efficiency. Over the past decade, several generations of vesicle systems were reported such as niosomes, transfersomes, and emulsomes (Alhakamy et\u00a0al., 2020). The emulsome system acquired a favorable environment for loading lipophilic drugs as it consists of a lipid core surrounded by a phospholipid (PL) bilayer that can retain higher lipophilic drug amounts. Moreover, water-soluble drugs can be encapsulated in the aqueous site of the outer shell layer (Bolat et\u00a0al., 2020). Subsequently, emulsome is noticed as a reliable drug delivery system due to proper drug entrapment efficiency, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and controlled drug release (Zhou & Chen, 2015).\nThis study aims to improve ATO potential as an antifungal drug by encapsulation into an emulsome (EML) vesicle system. EMLs were selected to allow deep penetration into the skin layers and improve drug activity. ATO-loaded EMLs were optimized by studying different factors. The optimum formula was subjected to in vivo permeability and skin irritation studies besides in vitro and in vivo microbiology studies. These studies were conducted to estimate the effectiveness of ATO against deep skin fungus infection. The study design is summarized in Scheme 1.\n\n## Materials\nAtorvastatin calcium was kindly gifted by EIPICO, Egypt. Phospholipon\u00ae 90G was a gift sample from Phospholipid GmbH (Nattermannallee, Germany). Soya phosphatidylcholine, Solutol, and cellulose membrane (Molecular weight cut off: 12,000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Loius, MO, USA). Compritol 888 ATO and Gelucire 40/14 (PEG glyceride) were a kind gift from Gatteffose, France. Potassium dihydrogen phosphate and di-sodium hydrogen phosphate were purchased from El-Nasr Pharmaceutical Co. (Cairo, Egypt). All other used chemicals were of analytical grade.\n\n## Preparation of ATO-EMLs\nATO-EMLs were prepared as per the reported method (El-Zaafarany et\u00a0al., 2016; Sawant et\u00a0al., 2016) using a thin-film hydration technique with slight modification. ATO was solubilized first in a sufficient methanol volume, while specified quantities of other components were solubilized in a mixture of chloroform/methanol (2:1, vol/vol) before mixing. Using rotary evaporator under reduced pressure until complete solvent evaporation occurred. The residual films were then hydrated with a specified volume of deionized water with gentle agitation for 1\u2009h, and the resulting formulae were subjected to bath sonication for 1\u2009min and then probe sonication under variable conditions (750\u2009W, 20\u2009kHz).\n\n## Experimental design\nThe structure of the study was formed according to the One-Factor-at-a-Time (OFAT) design. Different variables were studied gradually by changing only one factor at each trial and keeping the rest fixed. Eleven factors have been investigated as shown in Table 1: PL amount expressed as phospholipon G (PLG) (22.5, 45, 90, 135\u2009mg), types of PL (PLG, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and solutol), lipid types (Compritol and Gelucire), the temperature during emulsome formation (60\u2009\u00b0C, and room temperature(RT)), initial drug amount (10, 50, and 100\u2009mg), PC amount (22.5, 45, and 90\u2009mg), lipid amount (22.5, 45, and 90\u2009mg), hydration volume (10, 15, and 20\u2009mL), homogenization effect, probe sonication time (3, 6, 12, and 30\u2009min), and probe amplitude (40%, and 50%).\nStudied different factors aiming to optimize a vesicle system that possesses the minimum particle size (PS) in an acceptable range with a minimum polydispersity index (PDI), higher zeta potential (ZP) as an absolute value, and maximum entrapment efficiency percent (EE%).\n\n## Dynamic light scattering\nThe dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique was used at 25\u2009\u00b0C to assess PS, PDI, and ZP for various emulsome formulae using Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Deionized water was used to dilute the nanovesicle dispersion. Means and standard deviations for triplicate measurements were computed.\n\n## Entrapment efficiency\nAtorvastatin EE% in the emulsomes system was measured indirectly. One mL of ATO-loaded emulsomal dispersion system (amounting to 6.7\u2009mg ATO) was centrifuged at 20,000\u2009rpm for 1\u2009h at 4\u2009\u00b0C using a cooling centrifuge (Sigma 3K 30, Germany) to separate the unentrapped drug. The residue was washed twice with deionized water and then recentrifuged for 1\u2009h as the method reported by Aldawsari et\u00a0al. (2021) and Sawant et\u00a0al. (2016) with slight modulation. The combined supernatant was analyzed using UV\u2013vis spectrophotometer at 238.6\u2009nm (Shimadzu UV 1650 Spectrophotometer, Japan). All determinations were made in triplicate. EE% was determined using the following equation:\nEE%=TD\u2212UDTD\u00d7100\nwhere TD and UD denote the amount of total drug and unentrapped drug in the supernatant, respectively.\n\n## Vesicle morphology\nA transmission electron microscope (TEM) was utilized to inspect ATO-EMLs morphology (TEM; CM12; Philips, USA). The investigation focused on the best vesicle formulation. To visualize the emulsome vesicle structure, the sample was dried on a carbon-coated grid and stained negatively with an aqueous solution of 1% phosphotungstic acid. The sample was imaged using TEM after the stain had dried (Elbaz et\u00a0al., 2016).\n\n## Differential scanning calorimetry\nThermal analysis was achieved using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Shimadzu TA-60, Japan). Analysis was performed on free ATO, Compritol, PC, and ATO-EMLs vesicles. Each sample was scanned at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 300\u2009\u00b0C. Thermograms were obtained at a scanning rate of 10\u2009\u00b0C/min (Abdellatif et\u00a0al., 2017).\n\n## X-ray diffraction analysis\nUsing X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed diffraction patterns of ATO pure powder, Compritol, PC, and optimized lyophilized ATO-loaded emulsome formulation. The diffractograms in a Scintag X-ray diffractometer (USA) were recorded at 45\u2009kV, the current 30\u2009mA, the steps 0.02, and the counting rate of 0.5\u2009s/step at room temperature (Nasr et\u00a0al., 2015; Shamma et\u00a0al., 2019).\n\n## Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy\nFourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy studies were applied on free ATO, PC, Compritol, and optimum formula using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu IR- Affinity-1, Japan). The scanning was applied in the range of 399\u20134000\u2009cm\u22121 at a resolution of 4\u2009cm\u22121 at ambient temperature with a speed of 2\u2009mm/s (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2015).\n\n## Stability study\nAttributes of optimized formulation during storage in a glass vial at 4\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C and 25\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C under controlled humidity of 75% RH have been studied. Physical appearance, PS, PDI, ZP, and EE% were evaluated to reflect the physicochemical stability of prepared ATO-EMLs. Measurements were taken immediately in triplicate after the vesicle system was prepared and at various time intervals over three months.\n\nThe release study was carried out using a diffusion technique with a surface area equal to 5\u2009cm2. A 100\u2009mL of the diffusion media consisting of PBS (pH: 5.5) containing 10% propylene glycol to maintain sink condition was kept in the receiver chamber at 32\u2009\u00b0C by continuous stirring at 100\u2009rpm, 1.5\u2009mL of the emulsomal suspension containing a fixed weight of ATO (10\u2009mg) was placed in the donor compartment of the diffusion cell. At predetermined time intervals, samples were withdrawn, and the drug concentration was determined using a UV/visible spectrophotometer. The receptor chamber was then compensated with equal volumes of fresh medium.\nCore drug entrapment was determined by adding excess organic solvent (ethanol) to emulsomal suspension to ensure the complete dissolution of the shell layer and the drug entrapped in it. Subsequently, a cooling centrifuge was used to separate the dissolved drug and PL components in the supernatant from the drug which was still entrapped in the pellet. Later, the pellet was redispersed in deionized water, and the amount of drug entrapped in the lipid core was determined using a diffusion cell under the same condition as the previous release study.\nData obtained from the release study was subjected to zero order, first order, second order, Weibull model, Higuchi model, and Hixson\u2013Crowell model, etc., looking for the best fitting one with a higher correlation coefficient (R2) using (KinetDS) software (Mendyk et\u00a0al., 2012) and data interpretation according to Costa and Sousa Lobo and Zhang et\u00a0al. (Costa & Sousa Lobo, 2001; Y. Zhang et\u00a0al., 2010).\n\nDepth of skin penetration of the vesicle system was simulated by loading a fluorescent dye in the formula that was inspected using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), as targeting deep layers of the skin was desired (Alvarez-Rom\u00e1n et\u00a0al., 2004).\n\n## Preparation of FDA-loaded emulsomal dispersion\nEmulsomes loaded with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) were prepared by using the thin-film hydration technique as mentioned previously, while FDA was added instead of ATO.\n\n## Skin preparation\nThe in vivo permeation study was carried out according to the guidelines approved by the ethical committee of the Department of Pharmacy, Cairo University (serial number of the protocol PI 2850). An albino rat was prepared by removing the hair after drawing a specific mark on the dorsal area about approximately 2\u2009cm2. FDA-loaded nanovesicle was applied to the identified area and remained for 24\u2009h. After application, the rat was sacrificed by a cervical dislocation method, and skin tissue including the application zone was excised and kept in the freezer (\u201320\u2009\u00b0C) until CLSM investigation, as reported in Kassem et\u00a0al. where utilizing in vivo visualization strategy using CLSM for vesicle formulation (niosomes) on rat skin (Kassem et\u00a0al., 2017).\n\n## Confocal laser scanning microscopy study\nThe longitudinal section was investigated for fluorescence in the skin tissues upon being placed between a glass slide and a cover slip. The slides were visualized using a microscope (LSM 710; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The excitation and emission wavelengths of the FDA were \u03bbmax 488\u2009nm and \u03bbmax 530\u2009nm, respectively. The skin thickness was optically scanned at 15\u2009\u00b5m increments from the skin surface of 0\u2009\u00b5m to a depth of 255\u2009\u00b5m. The penetration of the emulsome system in different skin layers was reflected by tiling and stitching several individual x-y images. Moreover, fluorescence intensity profile across skin layers was measured to detect the disposition of emulsomes. Finally, structuring a 3D plot using Z-stack mode was conducted as previously reported (Shamma & Aburahma, 2014).\n\n## Fungal strains\nStandard strains of C. albicans employed in this work were obtained from the culture collection unit at the Regional Center for Mycology and Biotechnology (Al Azhar University). Each strain was sub-cultured on sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) medium and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h to obtain inoculums for testing.\n\n## Preparation of the inoculums\nAbout two to three colonies from 24-h old culture were used as the inoculum following suspension in 10\u2009mL of 0.85% sodium chloride solution, which was autoclaved. The turbidity was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard units (i.e. 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 CFU/ml) (Alyousef, 2021).\n\n## Micro-dilution method\nThe micro-dilution method was used to determine the minimal concentration of free ATO suspension, ATO-EMLs, and blank EMLs formulae that induced the inhibition of visible yeast growth or turbidity, which is called minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (Rodr\u00edguez-Tudela et\u00a0al., 2003). Twofold serial dilutions of the extracts were inoculated directly in a microtiter plate containing Sabouraud broth to obtain concentrations ranging from 1.32 to 0.1\u2009mg/mL. Subsequently, each well was added to a final volume of 100\u2009\u03bcL of the strain inoculum (adjusted according to 0.5 McFarland standard units). The experiment was performed in triplicate. The culture plates were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h overnight. Negative control (Sabouraud broth only) and positive controls (Sabouraud broth and microorganism) were tested to determine medium sterility and inoculum viability, respectively. The activity of Fungistate (1% gel) as commercial control was also assessed with formulae dilutions as a standard. The lowest concentration at which there was no turbidity was determined as the MIC of the formulae.\n\n## Well diffusion method\nAnticandidal activity using a well diffusion assay of free ATO suspension, ATO-EMLs, and blank EMLs formulae was conducted. First, SDA media was prepared and autoclaved. About 15\u201320\u2009mL of the media was poured into sterile Petri dishes, spread homogeneously, and remained solidified for 30\u2009min. Thereafter, 0.2\u2009mL of inoculum (fungal strain in saline) was spread on an agar plate, and the excess was discarded via draining. The plates were then incubated at ambient temperature for 10\u2009min. Subsequently, a ditch of 4\u2009mm was shaped in each plate, using a sterile cork borer. Each well was filled with 50\u2013100\u2009\u03bcL of the diluted formulae. Commercial Fungistate 1% gel was used as positive control while saline was used as a negative control. The plates were incubated for 24\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The zone of inhibition was measured in millimeters (Senyi\u011fit et\u00a0al., 2014). The assay was triplicated for confirmation.\n\n## Skin irritation test\nIn vivo skin irritation test was conducted to assess the safety of the developed emulosmes formula. This study was carried out according to the guidelines approved by the ethical committee of the Department of Pharmacy, Cairo University (serial number of the protocol PI 2850). Twelve male Wistar albino rats (200\u2013250\u2009g) were assigned to two groups (6 rats for each group). Group I was assigned to the placebo emulsomes formula and Group II was assigned to the ATO-loaded emulsomes formula. All rats had access to normal chow and ad Lib. The hair of the dorsal side of the rats was shaved followed by the application of the formula. The skin irritation and erythema were observed for 3\u2009weeks to assess the safety of the formulations. Rats were sacrificed at two-time points (one and three weeks) by the cervical dislocation method. Skin specimens were obtained from rat dorsum, followed by washing with normal saline and fixed in 10% buffered formalin solution for 24\u2009h, then trimmed off, washed, dehydrated, cleaned, and embedded in paraffin. Sequential skin sections of 5\u20137\u2009\u03bcm thickness were cut and then mounted on glass slides. The obtained tissue sections were deparaffinized using xylol and stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological examination through the electric light microscope (Suvarna et\u00a0al., 2012). The histopathological findings were evaluated as scores graded as follows: \u2013 (no abnormality), + (slight), ++ (mild), +++ (moderate) for changes as previously reported (Watanabe et\u00a0al., 2009).\n\n## Microbiological study\nIn vivo microbiological study was conducted to assess the antimicrobial activity of the developed emulosmes formula. This study was carried out according to the guidelines approved by the ethical committee of the Department of Pharmacy, Cairo University (serial number of the protocol PI 2850). Eighteen male Wistar albino rats (200\u2013250\u2009g) were assigned to three groups (6 rats for each group). Group I was assigned to the positive control (skin infection without treatment). Group II was assigned to the standard antifungal drug (Terbinafine HCl) with a once-daily dose. Group III was assigned to the ATO-loaded emulsomes formula with one dose every 3\u2009days. For animal preparation, rats were housed individually with free access to food and water. Subcutaneous injection of betamethasone (2\u2009mg/kg body weight/day) three times daily for three days was administered to suppress rat immunity followed by 100\u2009\u00b5L of 107 CFU/mL intradermally injection of C. albicans (ATCC 10231) to the shaved dorsal skin of each rat (Abdellatif et\u00a0al., 2017). Signs of fungal skin infection were observed 3\u2009days after fungal induction. The treatment was continued for three weeks followed by scarification by the cervical dislocation method. The clinical symptoms of fungal skin infection were observed such as skin erythema. Skin specimens were collected from each group for histopathological and microbiological evaluations. For microbiological evaluation, skin specimens were washed, homogenated, and incubated in sabourad dextrose agar culture media for 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The colony-forming units (CFU) were counted and recorded. Histopathological examination was conducted as previously mentioned in the skin irritation test.\n\n## Statistical analysis of data\nStudent\u2019s t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s post hoc tests were used to determine the significant difference between the formulae under investigation. Significance level set at 0.05, and (*p\u2009<\u2009.05, **p\u2009<\u2009.01, ***p\u2009<\u2009.001, and ****p\u2009<\u2009.0001) assumed to be statistically significant by using Graph Pad Prism software (Version 6). All data were presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (n\u2009=\u20093).\n\n## Results and discussion\nTopical drug delivery mainly faces many changes due to the unique structure of the skin. The nature of the skin layers creates an obstacle to the penetration of topical antimicrobial drugs and hinders their activity. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of drugs limit their availability at a therapeutic level that leads to drug resistance. Therefore, discovering and repurposing new drugs were widely investigated. Nowadays, new studies generally focus on encapsulation in nanosystems with specific characterization to overcome those limitations. For this reason, this study focuses on developing emulsomes as a promising system for topical delivery of Atorvastatin (ATO-EMLs) as a repurposed drug for dermal fungal infection. Atorvastatin calcium has a pH-dependent solubility (pKa\u2009=\u20094.46 and logP\u2009=\u20096.36), which limits its penetration through skin layers. To achieve suitable topical delivery, the nanosystem was optimized to overcome Atorvastatin calcium physicochemical properties and target dermal fungal infection.\n\n## Evaluation of ATO-EMLs\nAs shown in Table 1, according to the OFAT method, the effects of several factors were evaluated stepwise, and the results were analyzed to achieve the best formulae with the predetermined characteristic, which are minimum PS and PDI beside maximum drug entrapment and surface charge (absolute).\n\n## PL amount\nIn formulae from E1 to E4, fixed Compritol amounts (45\u2009mg) were used with different amounts of PLG while all other variables were constant. As shown in Figure 1(a,b), all vesicles size were on the nanoscale, ranging from 254.7 to 661.8\u2009nm, and PDI values were between 0.44 and 0.76. E2 in comparison with E1 and E4 showed significantly decreased in PS (p\u2009<\u2009.0001) and PDI (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Although all formulations exhibited negative ZP (\u20137.7 to \u201313.2\u2009mV), as shown in Figure 1(c). E2 appeared significantly higher than E3 and E4 (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Entrapment efficiency values measured for E2 to E4 formulae were in the range of 73.62 to 79.22%, while E1 showed only 55.23% of drug entrapped (Figure 1(d)). As a result, E2 which contains 45\u2009mg of PLG possesses the lower PS and PDI (254.7\u2009nm and 0.44, respectively), with acceptable ZP (\u201311.34\u2009mV) and EE% (73.62%) values. Sawant et\u00a0al. reported using an emulsome system for loaded sparfloxacin at different PLG and Compritol amounts, where a decrease in PS results by increasing PLG up to nearly 50% of total lipid amount, otherwise further increase led to counter effect. It is remarked that exaggerated PLG concentration may initiate liposome formation with higher PS. Furthermore, it noticed an increase in EE% with higher PL amount which may be related to drug lipophilicity, this point of view agrees with our result (Sawant et\u00a0al., 2016). E2 was selected as minimizing PS improved vesicle penetration through stratum layers of the skin (Mosallam et\u00a0al., 2021).\n\n## PL type\nA weight of 45\u2009mg of PLG in E2 formulae was selected to be compared with other PL types; PC in E5, and solutol in E6 (Figure 1(e\u2013h)). The PS showed a higher increase with solutol (740.6\u2009nm) than PC (378\u2009nm) and PLG, a remarked significant decrease in the size of E5 than E6 was obtained (p\u2009<\u2009.001). The PDI of E5 and E6 were 0.58 and 0.68, respectively. E5 represented significantly higher ZP (\u201323.03\u2009mV) than E6 (\u201315.52\u2009mV) (p\u2009<\u2009.01) as well as E2 (\u201311.34\u2009mV) (p\u2009<\u2009.001). A slight decrease in entrapment appeared in the case of solutol as only 61.22% was entrapped instead of 73.62%, and 70.92% in the case of PLG and PC, respectively. E5 was selected according to maximized ZP for studying subsequent variables. As reported by Zhang et\u00a0al. while targeting dermal fungus infection using vesicle nanocarrier loaded with terbinafine hydrochloride, a maximizing in ZP contributed to higher repulsive forces that enhanced vesicle stability and improved the interaction with the skin layers, which is in agreement with current findings (L. Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020).\n\n## Lipid type\nThe lipid type factor was conducted by comparing Gelucire as a lipid core in formula E7 instead of Compritol in E5 while all other variables were constant. A close value of PS for the two lipids has been noticed in Figure 1(i) (378\u2009nm for E5, and 397.3\u2009nm for E7), while PDI were 0.58 and 0.49, respectively for E5 and E7 (Figure 1(j)). As shown in Figure 1(k,I), gelucire formula owns a significantly lower ZP (\u201310.98\u2009mV) when compared with the Compritol formula (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Compritol formula E5 showed significantly higher drug entrapment of 70%, while only 55.75% was entrapped for gelucire core E7 (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Accordingly, Compritol lipid core (E5) showed more convenient properties, so it was selected as the lipid type of choice. El-Zaafarany et\u00a0al. reported during the evaluation of different lipid types among studying oxcarbazepine-loaded emulsome that Compritol remarked preferable consistency with PC and better vesicle assembly (El-Zaafarany et\u00a0al., 2016). Furthermore, Aburahma and Badr-Eldin mentioned that Compritol acquired a higher entrapment capacity for the lipophilic drug due to longer hydrocarbon chain length that resulted in interchain intercalation and promote intermolecular entrapment, those results supported our selection in lipid type factor (Aburahma & Badr-Eldin, 2014).\n\n## Temperature during emulsome formation\nIn a way to determine the favorable conditions for ATO-EMLs formation, the rotation temperature during vesicle formation was studied as shown in Figure 2(a\u2013d). E5 formula has been formed at about 60\u2009\u00b0C, while a new formula with the same variables was prepared and rotated at room temperature (E8). No significant differences have been observed in PS whereas the new z-average value was 312\u2009nm, but the PDI was remarked to be preferable as it was about 0.4 which reflects a significant decrease in E8 than E5 (p\u2009<\u2009.05). The ZP of E8 was \u201322.11, and the amount of drug entrapped rise to 80.3%. E8 that rotated at room temperature showed lower PDI, and the visual appearance of the forming film reflected higher stability and better homogeneity. Kumar et\u00a0al. upon studying emulsomes vesicle system formulation elements and preparation methods noticed that lipid core materials required room temperature (25\u2009\u00b0C) for solidification and stabilization, that concept supported E8 selection (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2013).\n\n## Initial drug amount\nAccording to the study objectives, a higher drug amount was desired for easier application, therefore the initial drug amount (10\u2013100\u2009mg) was evaluated to decide whether it was acceptable for the system to fit with the elevated drug amount or not. Variations in PS and PDI were observed in Figure 2(e,f), the PS values were in the range of 312\u2013645.2\u2009nm with a significant increase in E10 than E8 and E9 (p\u2009<\u2009.001), while PDI of E10 showed a significant decrease with E8 only (p\u2009<\u2009.001). In general, PDI values ranged from 0.4 to 0.8. No significant changes were observed in ZP (\u201322.07 up to \u201323.84) as shown in Figure 2(g). EE% showed 79.5%\u201383.84% as shown in Figure 2(h). Drug entrapped was maximized in E10 as a result of higher drug amount. As a higher drug amount affected PS and PDI, E10 with superior encapsulation efficiency was selected to fulfill the study objectives. However, additional optimization will be applied. Cooper and Harirforoosh upon studying the effect of formulation variables on celecoxib nanoparticles evaluated the effect of different drug amounts on entrapment capacity. Results showed that increasing drug amount triggers PL activation to enhance drug solubility and system stability, reduce drug leakage, and supported higher entrapment (Cooper & Harirforoosh, 2014). Celecoxib belongs to BCS Class II which is similar to atorvastatin as both revealed close solubility attributes. On the other hand, higher ATO-EMLs encapsulation leads to PS increment in E10 as previously reported (Vyas et\u00a0al., 2006).\n\n## PC amount\nPC amount was studied to optimize E10. A gradual decrease in PS (Figure 2(i)) and PDI (Figure 2(j)) were observed with increasing PC amount. At higher PL amounts (E12), PS was 520.7\u2009nm, which was significantly lower than E11 (837.1\u2009nm) (p\u2009<\u2009.01). While PDI values for E10, E11, and E12 were 0.81, 0.98, and 0.58, respectively. E12 appeared significantly lower than E10 (p\u2009<\u2009.05), and E11 (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Similar ZP was recorded (\u201319.95 to \u201322.07\u2009mV) as shown in Figure 2(k). The entrapped percent revealed that E11 (62.11%) was significantly lower than E10 and E12 with 83.8% and 81.5%, respectively (p\u2009<\u2009.05) as shown in Figure 2(l). Therefore, E12 was selected due to PS and PDI was the lowest values at highest PC amount (90\u2009mg). As mentioned in the study by Abo El-Enin et\u00a0al. upon studying an emulsome system loaded with eletriptan hydrobromide using PC in different molar ratios with compritol, a reduction in PS was reported with a higher PC amount as more emulsome vesicles may be formed (Abo El-Enin et\u00a0al., 2022). These findings agreed with reported results of E12. In addition, Raza et\u00a0al. explained that the emulsification properties of PL are supposed to be applied in a concentration-dependent manner (Raza et\u00a0al., 2013).\n\n## Lipid amount\nThe lipid core was inspected by adjusted Compritol weight in E13 and E14 in comparison with E12 as shown in Figure 3(a\u2013d). PS ranged from 520.7 to 858.2\u2009nm, whereas PDI ranged from 0.58 to 0.89. E12 acquired a significantly lower PS and PDI than E13 (p\u2009<\u2009.01), it was an inconsiderable difference between E12 and E14 but with preferable results to E12 as it contains the minimal lipid amount with reduced PS (520.7\u2009nm) and PDI (0.58) values. No significant difference showed in ZP (\u201320.12 to \u201321.31) and EE% (69.73\u201382.21%). As a result, E12 with lipid:PL ratio (0.5:1) exhibited the most appropriate features so it was selected for further optimization conditions. Dubey and Vyas evaluated emuls",
