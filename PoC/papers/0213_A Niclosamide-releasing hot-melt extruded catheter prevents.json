  "full_text": "## Introduction\nCatheters represent an indispensable medical tool to improve the health quality and medical care of patients. The demand for catheters has increased due to the wide use of such devices in the administration of medications, nutritional support, blood sampling and performing dialysis in critically or chronically ill patients1. At least 150\u00a0million intravascular catheters are used annually in North America alone2. However, 3.5% of these catheters are colonized by bacterial or fungal pathogens causing serious and costly bloodstream infections3. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) increase the morbidity and mortality of intensive care patients with a mortality ranging from 19 to 34%4. These infections are mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria, mostly Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis5,6. CRBSIs are primarily due to bacterial colonization of the catheter surface during insertion leading to a biofilm infection5. Bacterial cells encased in biofilm structures are very difficult to be eradicated by the immune defenses and antimicrobial agents7,8. Hence, catheters must be removed and replaced to prevent further medical complications. Preventing bacterial attachment and subsequent biofilm formation on catheter surfaces would be the most cost-effective strategy to prevent CRBSIs9.\nThere are many strategies described in the literature to address this increasing problem. These can be categorized as: (1) antifouling strategies such as hydration and steric repulsion, specific protein interactions, or low surface energy, and (2) antimicrobial mechanisms such as the release of biocidal agents, or surface microbicidal activity10. The release of biocidal agents approach has been extensively investigated over the past years via incorporating or coating medical devices with biocidal compounds such as antibiotics or other active compounds, for instance compounds identified in \u201crepurposing\u201d studies.\nAntibacterial drug repurposing entails the use of already approved drugs for novel applications, such as antibacterial indications11. Niclosamide (NIC), an anthelmintic drug declared by the WHO as an essential medicine12, has been identified as one of the most promising candidates to combat Gram-positive infections, especially those caused by S. aureus and S. epidermidis, being effective at relatively low concentrations (between 0.0625 and 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL)13\u201320. However, given its poor solubility in water and low bioavailability, it may be less suitable for treating systemic infections21\u201323. Nevertheless, NIC has the potential to be applied to treat localized infections such as wound, soft tissue, gastrointestinal, skin and biomaterial associated infections (BAI)14,15,23\u201327.\nBased on this rationale, the aim of this research work was to develop an antibacterial catheter releasing NIC to prevent catheter-related infections. Specifically, we developed a local drug delivery system by incorporating NIC into the polymeric matrix of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) via solvent casting. Furthermore, the resulting material was used to fabricate antibacterial catheters by hot-melt extrusion (HME) technology. The produced catheters were characterized by studying the effect of NIC loading on the mechanical and thermal properties of the TPU. Moreover, the antimicrobial efficacy of the catheters was tested in vitro and subsequently in a murine BAI model.\n\n## Reagents\nThermoplastic polyurethane (TPU; Tecoflex EG-60D) was obtained from Lubrizol, VELOX, The Netherlands. The polymer contains a soft and hard segment in a ratio of 3:1. The glass transition temperature is 23\u00a0\u00b0C28. Niclosamide (NIC; N3510,\u2009\u2265\u200998% purity) and all other reagents and materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) unless indicated otherwise.\n\n## Bacterial strains\nFor in vitro microbiological evaluation, the bacterial strains used were the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus ATCC 25923 (MSSA), the methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA), the methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis O47 (MSSE) and the methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis ATCC 35984 (MRSE). The MSSA and MRSA were used in the in vivo BAI model. The bacteria were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB; Difco Laboratories Inc, USA) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Specific growth conditions for each experiment are described in the respective sections.\n\n## Material preparation\nTPU was loaded with NIC at 2, 5 and 10% (w/w) using the solvent casting approach adopted from the work of Shaqour et al.29, as shown in Fig.\u00a01A. First, the required amount of NIC was suspended in chloroform and sonicated for 30\u00a0min. Then, a magnetic stirrer was used to homogeneously distribute the NIC particles for 30\u00a0min. Subsequently, the TPU was added to the system while stirring and the suspension was left overnight to dissolve the polymer. The ratio between TPU and chloroform was 12.5% (w/v). The polymer solution with suspended NIC was then poured into a petri dish with a diameter of 200\u00a0mm to allow the chloroform to evaporate. Finally, the casted films were vacuum dried for 3\u00a0days at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00a0mbar.Figure 1Process for (A) incorporating NIC into the polymeric matrix of TPU using solvent casting and (B) for producing fibers and catheters using HME technology. Scale bar in B is 200\u00a0\u03bcm.\nFibers and catheters were extruded using an in-house single screw extrusion setup attached with an e3d v6 stainless steel nozzle (E3D-Online, United Kingdom) with a diameter of 0.8\u00a0mm or a specially in-house designed and 3D-printed coaxial nozzle30 (Fig.\u00a01B). To extrude the fibers and catheters, first, cast films (with or without NIC) were cut into stripes and directly fed into the extruder. Subsequently, fibers and catheters were extruded at a temperature of 180\u00a0\u00b0C with a screw extrusion speed of 75\u00a0rpm. The extruded fibers were cut into 4\u00a0cm segments and used to evaluate the effect of NIC loading on the mechanical properties of the TPU, while the extruded catheters segments (0.5 and 1\u00a0cm length) were used for material characterization and for microbiological characterization. Catheter segments for microbiological testing were further sterilized by incubation in ethanol 70% for 1\u00a0min followed by air-drying for 30\u00a0s29.\n\n## Microscopy\nCatheter segments were inspected using an S9i microscope (Leica, Belgium). Catheters from each group were imaged and then analyzed using ImageJ software version 1.52a31 (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) by calculating the equivalent diameter (Eq.\u00a01) of the measured area for the inner and outer circles for each catheter (n\u2009=\u20096 for each group)29.1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Equivalent} \\; \\text{ diameter}=\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{4*Area}{\\pi }}\\right)$$\\end{document}Equivalentdiameter=4\u2217Area\u03c0\n\n## Mechanical testing\nTensile tests were performed according to ISO 527-1 standard32 on an AGS 5\u00a0kND machine (Shimadzu, Germany). The tensile rate was set to 20\u00a0mm/min and the distance between grips was 20\u00a0mm. Extruded fibers (n\u2009=\u20095 per group) were used for this test. Then, the tensile stress at 100% strain was measured.\n\n## Thermal analysis\nThermogravimetric analysis was conducted on a Q5000 analyzer (TA Instruments, USA). Samples of around 10\u00a0mg were placed on a platinum pan and then a dynamic heating ramp of 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min with the resolution of 3\u00a0\u00b0C to 500\u00a0\u00b0C under nitrogen flow of 60\u00a0mL/min was applied.\n\n## Contact angle\nThe water contact angle measurements were done at room temperature using demineralized water and an OCA20 goniometer (Dataphysics, Germany). For each sample, the left and the right contact angles of at least 10\u00a0droplets with a volume of 2\u00a0\u00b5L were measured and averaged.\n\n## Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy\nNIC powder before and after heating to 180\u00a0\u00b0C was examined using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to study the effect of heat on NIC molecules. Moreover, to study the interactions between NIC and the TPU molecules, FTIR analysis was conducted on the produced catheters. The FTIR spectrometer used (Nicolet 8700, ThermoScientific, USA) was equipped with a diamond attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory. All ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded in the 400\u20134000\u00a0cm\u22121 range at room temperature. The spectral resolution and accuracy were 4\u00a0cm\u22121 and\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u00a0cm\u22121, respectively.\n\n## X-ray diffraction\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to analyze the solid-state characteristics of NIC pure powder, non-loaded TPU, and NIC-loaded TPU catheters. The XRD analyses were run in transmission mode on PANalytical X\u2019Pert Pro X-Ray Diffractometer (PANalytical B.V., The Netherlands) equipped with an X\u2019Celerator detector using a standard XRD method. The instrumental parameters used are listed in the supplementary Table 1.\n\n## In vitro drug release assay\nCatheter segments loaded with NIC (2, 5 and 10% (w/w)) and non-loaded, with a length of 1\u00a0cm were weighted using a microbalance (Sartorius, Germany). NIC is a hydrophobic drug, and therefore is poorly soluble in aqueous solutions such as PBS33. To perform an accurate quantification of released NIC, we supplemented PBS with Tween 80 in order to increase the solubility of NIC in PBS while increasing the saturation concentration of the drug34. Then, each catheter segment was placed in 1\u00a0mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; ThermoFisher, USA) with 2% of Tween\u00a080 (ThermoFisher, USA) and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with an agitation of 120\u00a0rpm (n\u2009=\u20093 per group). The buffer solution was exchanged for the fresh solution at every time point (1, 3, 4, 6 and 24\u00a0h, daily on days 2\u201310, and at 13, 16, 20 and 27\u00a0days). The aliquots were stored at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C for later use. The concentration of NIC released at every time point was calculated by measuring the absorbance at 340\u00a0nm of 300\u00a0\u00b5L of each aliquot in the flat bottom 96\u00a0well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One, USA) with a multi-well plate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, USA). A calibration curve was plotted for NIC to estimate the concentration of drug released from the catheter segments. This calibration curve ranged from 1 to 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL with R2 equal to 0.9998.\n\n## In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test\nTo evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and quantitatively assess the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of NIC after heating at 180\u00a0\u00b0C to mimic the extrusion process, MSSA was grown in TSB at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 120\u00a0rpm until reaching mid-logarithmic growth phase, and an inoculum of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u00a0CFU/mL was prepared by dilution in fresh TSB, based on the optical density at 620\u00a0nm. Ninety microliters of TSB containing either unheated NIC control or NIC heated at 180\u00a0\u00b0C were twofold serially diluted in TSB from 128 to 0.125\u00a0\u00b5g/mL in a flat bottom microtiter plate. Immediately after, 10\u00a0\u00b5L of bacterial inoculum was added to the solution and incubated overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C 120\u00a0rpm. As a control for bacterial growth, 10\u00a0\u00b5L of the inoculum was incubated in TSB without NIC. The MIC was defined as the lowest NIC concentration without visible bacterial growth overnight. For the MBC, 2 droplets of 10\u00a0\u00b5L of the undiluted samples from the wells without visible growth, were plated at blood agar plates (Oxoid, United Kingdom) and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. The MBC was assessed the next day as the lowest concentration of NIC which had caused\u2009\u2265\u200999.9% reduction in numbers of CFU compared to the inoculum.\n\n## Evaluation of antimicrobial properties of TPU-catheters loaded with NIC\nCatheter segments loaded with 2, 5, and 10% (w/w) NIC and non-loaded catheter segments were analysed for antibacterial activity (release) and prevention of biofilm formation using the MSSA, MRSA, MSSE and MRSE strains.\nFirstly, a modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay35 was performed to determine the zone of inhibition (ZOI) of 0.5\u00a0cm catheter segments loaded with NIC and non-loaded catheters. Briefly, 1 to 3\u00a0colonies of each strain were incubated in 5\u00a0mL of TSB overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 120\u00a0rpm. Two hundred microliters of an inoculum of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u00a0CFU/mL was spread on blood agar plates with a cotton swab. The catheter segments were inserted vertically into the blood agar plates, which were then incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The next day, the catheter segments were transferred to freshly inoculated blood agar plates and this step was repeated for 10\u00a0days. Each day the resulting zones of growth inhibition (including catheter diameter) were measured in mm.\nSecondly, 1\u00a0cm catheter segments were placed in tubes containing suspensions of each of the 4 bacterial strains (approx. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u00a0CFU/mL) in 1\u00a0mL of TSB. Catheter segments were incubated in the bacterial suspensions at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 120\u00a0rpm for 24\u00a0h. After the incubation, 2\u00a0measures of bacterial growth were quantified: (1) planktonic bacterial growth in the medium; and (2) biofilm formation on the catheter surfaces.\nTo assess the antibacterial activity, planktonic cells in the medium were enumerated by quantitative culture, performed as follows: aliquots of the suspensions were taken, tenfold serially diluted, and the dilutions and undiluted suspensions plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates; these plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h and CFUs were determined. Similarly, biofilm formation was quantitatively measured by enumerating the viable cells attached to the surface. In brief, catheter segments were removed from the medium and rinsed 3 times in PBS to remove planktonic cells. Immediately thereafter, catheter segments were transferred to 1\u00a0mL of PBS, vortexed for 30\u00a0s, and sonicated for 15\u00a0min using an ultrasonic bath (Branson CPX2800-E, 40\u00a0kHz) to detach and disperse adherent-biofilm cells. This procedure does not affect viability of the bacteria. The bacteria recovered from the catheter segments were quantitatively cultured. For each experiment, triplicates were analyzed for each sample (NIC-loaded and non-loaded catheter segments).\nFinally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to visualize the morphological changes of MSSA bacterial cells adhered to NIC loaded and non-loaded catheter segments. As previously described in this section, bacterial suspensions were incubated with NIC loaded and non-loaded catheter segments until\u00a0the washing steps with PBS. Prior to SEM imaging, samples were fixed in a solution of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde supplemented with 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Merck, USA) overnight at room temperature. Samples were rinsed twice with demineralized water for 10\u00a0min and dehydrated in a graded ethanol concentration series from 50 to 100% of ethanol. To reduce the sample surface tension, samples were immersed in hexamethyldisilane (Polysciences Inc., USA) overnight and air-dried. Before imaging, samples were mounted on aluminum SEM stubs and sputter-coated with a 4\u00a0nm platinum\u2013palladium layer using a Leica EM ACE600 sputter coater (Microsystems, Germany). Images were acquired at 8\u00a0kV using a Zeiss Sigma 300 SEM (Zeiss, Germany) at the Electron Microscopy Center Amsterdam (ECMA; Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Of each tube, 6\u20138\u00a0fields were inspected and photographed at magnifications of 100\u00d7\u2009and 500\u00d7. Catheter segments loaded with 10% of NIC were not included in the results as the material was partially degraded by the fixation procedure for SEM visualization.\n\n## In vivo evaluation of TPU-catheters loaded with NIC using a murine BAI model\nThe efficacy of NIC-loaded catheters to prevent infection was evaluated in vivo using a murine BAI model. As S. aureus is one of the most frequent pathogens in medical device-related infection5,6, the MSSA and MRSA strains were used for the in vivo evaluation of the NIC loaded catheters.\nAll experiments involving animals were carried out in accordance with the European directive 2010/63/UE governing animal welfare and protection, which is acknowledged by the Italian Legislative Decree no 26/2014, the company policy on the care and use of laboratory animals, and the ARRIVE guidelines. All the studies were revised and agreed by the Aptuit Committee on Animal Research and Ethics (Animal Welfare Body) and approved by Italian Ministry of Health (authorization n. 51/2014-PR). Male CD-1 mice (Charles River, Italy), weighing between 18 and 20\u00a0g, were housed in solid bottomed plastic cages with sawdust litter at a temperature of 20\u201322\u00a0\u00b0C, a relative humidity range of 45\u201365%, and lighting from approximately 06:00 to 18:00\u00a0h daily. Mice were fed a standard maintenance diet (A. Rieper SpA, Italy) and drinking water was filtered from normal domestic supply. Diet regimen was ad libitum. A period of acclimatization of 5\u00a0days was implemented before any experimental procedure. Animals were monitored during the entire period of the studies and clinical signs were recorded.\nBriefly, the mice were anesthetized using inhaled isoflurane at 2.5% and the back of the mice was shaved using an electric razor and cleaned using an aqueous solution of benzalkonium chloride 0.175% (v/v). Two small incisions were made in both flanks of the mice and two subcutaneous pockets were created using forceps, a 1\u00a0cm catheter segment was inserted into each pocket and the incisions were closed using surgical staples (Autoclip wound closing system, Clay Adams, USA) under sterile conditions. Each mouse received two catheter segments with the same concentration of NIC, either non-loaded, 2 or 5% (w/w) NIC loaded catheters (n\u2009=\u20097 mice per group, so n\u2009=\u200914 catheter segments per group). Three additional mice were added to each experimental group and dedicated to histological analysis on day 3 post-infection, similarly at the same time point, a group comprised of mice implanted with TPU catheters in the absence of infection was also added for comparison in the histological analysis (Fig.\u00a02).Figure 2In vivo efficacy evaluation of non-loaded, 2 and 5% (w/w) NIC loaded TPU catheters using a murine BAI model. Two 1\u00a0cm catheters segments were implanted subcutaneously in the mice and a bacterial challenge (106\u00a0CFU in 100\u00a0\u03bcL) of either MSSA or MRSA was injected intraluminally into each catheter. Blood, catheter segments, and the surrounding tissue were collected of mice sacrificed on day 1, 3, 7 and 14 after challenge. Bacterial colonization of the catheter and the surrounding tissue, and the NIC concentration in plasma and in the tissue surrounding the catheter were quantified.\nImmediately following catheter implantation, 100\u00a0\u03bcL containing 106\u00a0CFU of either MSSA or MRSA were injected intraluminally into the catheter segments (Fig.\u00a02).\nAnimals were anesthetized using inhaled isoflurane (2.5%) and the blood collected by terminal cardiac puncture at 1, 3, 7 or 14\u00a0days post-infection. Blood, catheter segments and the respective surrounding tissue were collected. Biopsies were aseptically retrieved using a 12\u00a0mm diameter biopsy punch and accordingly processed for bacterial load determination: catheter segments were separated from their surrounding tissue and rinsed3\u00a0times in 0.9% saline solution to remove non-adherent bacteria. Next, catheter segments were transferred into tubes containing 1\u00a0mL of sterile PBS, vortexed for 30\u00a0s and sonicated for 15\u00a0min using an ultrasonic bath (Branson CPX2800-E, 40\u00a0kHz) to detach and disperse biofilm cells from the catheter surfaces. Recovered bacteria from the catheters were then quantitively cultured. Surrounding tissue was homogenized in 1\u00a0mL of PBS using a Precelys tissue homogenizer device (Bertin Technologies, France). Tissue homogenates were quantitatively cultured to enumerate viable bacterial cells residing in the tissue. In case of bacterial growth on day\u00a014 post-infection in the experiment with MRSA, S. aureus colonies were retrieved from all of the experimental groups and the MIC for NIC was determined for all single retrieved colonies following the CLSI guidelines36,37.\nFor histopathology analysis, biopsies were retrieved from histology dedicated mice at day 3 post-infection and preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Following fixation, samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at a nominal thickness of 3\u20135\u00a0\u00b5m and stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin for histological analysis.\nThe NIC in vivo release profile in animals carrying NIC-loaded catheters was determined in plasma and in the tissue surrounding the catheter segments collected on day 1, 3, 7 and 14 post infection. First plasma was collected as follows: 1\u00a0mL of blood was placed in K3-EDTA collection tubes (Greiner Bio-One, USA) and centrifuged at 3000\u00a0RCF, 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. Fifty microliters of supernatant-containing plasma were then retrieved and mixed with 150\u00a0\u00b5L of HEPES 0.1\u00a0N and stored at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C until analysis.\nSecond, catheter surrounding tissue was processed as previously described and resulting tissue homogenates were further homogenized by enzymatical digestion: 1\u00a0mL of a solution of collagenase type 1 (8\u00a0mg/mL in PBS) and incubated for 3\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with agitation. Digested tissue homogenates were kept at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C until analysis. Prior to the analytical procedure, plasma and tissue homogenate samples were deproteinized with 2 volumes of acetonitrile containing diclofenac (200\u00a0ng/mL) as internal standard, vortexed and then centrifuged at 3000\u00a0RPM for 10\u00a0min. After centrifugation, supernatants were diluted (160\u00a0\u00b5L ultrapure water\u2009+\u2009200\u00a0\u00b5L of supernatant) using a Hamilton Microlab STARlet small liquid handler (Hamilton Company, Switzerland). Levels of NIC in supernatants were determined by analyzing 2\u00a0\u03bcL of the supernatants using a Waters ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography system (UPLC; Milford, USA) coupled with an API400 (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, USA) in tandem mass spectrometry mode (LC\u2013MS/MS). Chromatographic separation was performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 30\u2009\u00d7\u20092.1\u00a0mm, 1.7\u00a0\u00b5m analytical column. Mobile Phase A consisted of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water; mobile phase B was 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nQuantitative data was expressed as the average\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation, with the number of samples stated in each experiment. The statistical analysis of all the in vitro and in vivo characterization experiments was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett\u2019s comparison test to evaluate post-hoc differences between the test groups with respect to the control group. Alpha was set at 0.05 for all analyses. Statistical analysis and data representation were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.00 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA; https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/). *Indicates\u00a0a p-value of 0.01 to 0.05, **indicates a p-value of 0.001 to 0.01, ***p-value of 0.0001 to 0.001, ****indicates a p-value\u2009<\u20090.0001.\n\n## TPU films loaded with NIC and catheter/fiber extrusion\nThe NIC loaded and non-loaded TPU films were successfully produced. The non-loaded TPU films were transparent while the NIC-loaded ones were yellowish and opaque. TPU is highly soluble in chloroform21. The level of coloring and opaqueness increased with increasing NIC content. However, the NIC distribution was homogeneous as no agglomerates were spotted in the films.\nThe stress at 100% strain was used to assess the mechanical properties of the produced fibers and whether the addition of NIC affected TPU\u2019s mechanical properties. The extruded fibers from the 0.8\u00a0mm nozzle had a diameter of 0.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0mm. There were no significant differences between the NIC-loaded and non-loaded fibers and tubes in term of diameter dimensions. The generated stress\u2013strain curves for TPU and drug loaded samples are shown in supplementary Fig.\u00a01. The stress at 100% strain was 11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3, 10.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5, 11.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 and 9.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u00a0MPa for the non-loaded and 2, 5 and 10% (w/w) NIC loaded TPU fibers, respectively (Fig.\u00a03A). Only the 10% (w/w) NIC loaded fibers showed a slight but significant decrease in the stress (p\u2009=\u20090.0012) when compared to non-loaded TPU fibers, which may affect the mechanical properties of extruded catheters.Figure 3(A) Stress at 100% strain for produced TPU and NIC loaded TPU fibers (n\u2009=\u20095), (B) Inner and outer diameter of produced TPU tubes (n\u2009=\u20096), (C) Water contact angle measurements of produced TPU catheters (n\u2009=\u200910). (D) Percentage weight loss vs. temperature and (E) Derivative of percentage weight loss vs. temperature in produced TPU fibers. * Indicates a p-value of 0.01 to 0.05.\nThe produced catheters had an average outer and inner diameter of 1.24\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62\u00a0mm and 0.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0mm, respectively, with no differences between the different types of catheters (Fig.\u00a03B). The results of water contact angle measurements from non-loaded and NIC-loaded TPU catheters are shown in Fig.\u00a03C. All catheters were hydrophobic (i.e. contact angle higher than 90\u00b0)38, with a contact angle of 106.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u00b0, 106.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5\u00b0, 116.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0\u00b0 and 118.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\u00b0 for non-loaded, 2, 5 and 10% NIC loaded TPU catheters, respectively. The hydrophobicity of the NIC-loaded catheters increased with higher NIC loading, which is expected since NIC is considered a hydrophobic molecule39. However, only the 5 and 10% (w/w) NIC-loaded catheters (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) showed a significant increase in the contact angle when compared to non-loaded catheters.\nThermogravimetric analysis (Fig.\u00a03D,E) showed the thermal degradation behavior for NIC powder, non-loaded and NIC-loaded TPU catheter segments. NIC and TPU had an onset degradation temperature (Tonset) of 260\u00a0\u00b0C and 295\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Measurements of the NIC loaded catheters showed that the Tonset for NIC-loaded TPU was slightly higher than that of non-loaded catheters. Tonset for 2, 5 and 10% NIC loaded TPU were 315\u00a0\u00b0C, 313\u00a0\u00b0C and 311\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Such increase in Tonset was also reported when TPU was loaded with ciprofloxacin29 or tetracycline hydrochloride40, which indicates that, like NIC, the presence of these compounds improved the thermal stability of the polymer.\n\n## Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction analysis\nThe FTIR analysis for the untreated NIC powder and NIC heated at 180\u00a0\u00b0C revealed no major changes in the spectra due to the heating (supplementary Fig.\u00a02). The FTIR spectra of NIC powder, non-loaded and NIC loaded TPU are shown in Fig.\u00a04A. The NIC spectrum showed characteristic bands at 3576.34\u00a0cm\u22121, 3088.44\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1679.69\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponding to \u2013OH, \u2013NH, and C=O groups, respectively (Fig.\u00a04B)41. The non-loaded TPU tubes exhibited a typical distribution of absorption bands for this type of material42. The vibrational band at 3330\u00a0cm\u22121 corresponds to NH stretching vibrations. The peaks in the range from 3000 to 2800\u00a0cm\u22121 relate to CH asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching vibrations42. The double peak in the region of 1680 to 1740\u00a0cm\u22121 (C=O stretching vibrations), the bands above 1500\u00a0cm\u22121 (probably N\u2013H bending vibrations and C\u2013N stretching vibrations), and the strong bands in the region of 1300 to 1000\u00a0cm\u22121 (asymmetrical and symmetrical O\u2013C\u2013O stretching vibrations) are associated with the bonds of urethane groups42. The FTIR spectrum of NIC-loaded TPU tubes has characteristic peaks similar to those of the spectrum of non-loaded TPU tubes (Fig.\u00a04A). Moreover, also the new specific peaks due to the presence of NIC appeared in the spectra of the loaded with 5% and 10% (w/w) NIC. These peaks characteristic for NIC are practically invisible at the spectrum with the lowest NIC content. It was probably caused by the low intensity of these bands and the fact, that they were overlapped by the TPU peaks. For the higher content of NIC, the intensity of a peak of hydrogen-bonded N\u2013H group in the amorphous region of TPU (3320\u00a0cm\u22121) significantly decreased and the band of free N\u2013H group with no H-bond formation observed at 3450\u00a0cm\u22121 became stronger. Probably the drug particles weakened the force between H-bond groups of TPU and hindered the formation of a new H-bond, a similar effect was observed for the thermally processed composite of montmorillonite and polyamide43. Additionally, the strong band at 3535\u00a0cm\u22121 was observed, which can be assigned to the hydroxyl groups of NIC. In the comparison to the pure drug, the intensity of this peak increased, due to the amorphization of the drug44.Figure 4(A) FTIR spectra shown as the transmittance (%) of NIC, NIC-loaded and non-loaded TPU catheters (n\u2009=\u20093), (B) Molecular structure of TPU and NIC used in this study, (C) X ray powder diffraction pattern of non-loaded TPU catheters and TPU catheters loaded with 2, 5 and 10% (w/w) NIC and (D) NIC plain drug.\nThe XRD patterns of the non-loaded and NIC-loaded TPU tubes and pure NIC powder are reported in the Fig.\u00a04C,D. NIC powder exhibited the characteristic peaks corresponding to the crystal form of the molecule44. On the contrary, the XRD pattern of TPU indicated its amorphous nature45. The TPU tubes loaded with NIC showed an XRD pattern without the sharp NIC diffraction peaks, which suggests a transformation of crystalline NIC to its amorphous form, this phase change was also reported by Jara et al. when hot-melt extruding NIC with the polymer poly(1-vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) (PVP\u2013VA) at 180\u00a0\u00b0C for the production of enteric formulations with increased bioavailability46.\n\n## NIC thermostability and in vitro drug release\nHeating of NIC at 180\u00a0\u00b0C did not affect the antibacterial activity of the drug as judged from the MIC and MBC against MSSA and MRSA strains (Table 1). This indicates that NIC is thermally stable at the processing temperature and is expected not to lose its antimicrobial activity during extrusion at 180\u00a0\u00b0C.Table 1MIC and MBC of non-heated NIC, and heated NIC at 180\u00a0\u00b0C.BacteriaNiclosamide (\u03bcg/mL)Non heatedHeated (180\u00a0\u00b0C)MICMBCMICMBCMSSA0.06250.1250.06250.125MRSA0.1250.1250.1250.125\nThe estimated amount of NIC (\u00b5g) loaded per 1\u00a0cm catheter segment was 258\u2009\u00b1\u20093, 573\u2009\u00b1\u20095 and 1110\u2009\u00b1\u20097\u00a0\u00b5g, for tubes loaded with 2, 5 and 10% NIC, respectively.
