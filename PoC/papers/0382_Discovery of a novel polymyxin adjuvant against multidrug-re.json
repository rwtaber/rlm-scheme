  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntibiotic resistance is a significant global public health challenge, complicating the treatment of bacterial infections and leading to increased mortality and morbidity. Recent estimates suggest that approximately 700,000 people die annually from antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections, with projections indicating this number could rise to 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken1. The emergence of bacterial resistance has rendered many traditional antibiotics ineffective, further exacerbating the need for novel treatment strategies.\nAntibiotic adjuvants, or \u201cantibiotic potentiators\u201d, typically lack antimicrobial activity or exhibit minimal inhibition of bacterial growth but enhance the efficacy of antibiotics against resistant bacteria2, 3, 4, 5. By broadening the spectrum of bacterial coverage and suppressing resistance, adjuvants offer a complementary approach to combating bacterial infections6,7. Currently, only a few \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor adjuvants (clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam) are available7, underscoring the urgent need for more diverse adjuvant types.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that causes acute or chronic infection in immunocompromised patients, such as those with cystic fibrosis (CF), cancer, traumas, burns, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sepsis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, including cases related to COVID-198,9. The treatment of P. aeruginosa infections is particularly challenging due to its pathogen's rapid mutation rate and capacity to develop resistance to multiple antibiotics10. The multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa DK2 strain, first isolated from CF patients in 1973, has since evolved into an independent subspecies, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality rates11. Our results demonstrated that P. aeruginosa DK2 exhibits severe resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics, particularly the last-resort antibiotics Polymyxin B (PB, MIC\u00a0=\u00a0256\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and Colistin (MIC >256\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) (Supporting Information Fig.\u00a0S1A). Our previous study identified niclosamide (NIC), an anthelmintic drug, as an adjuvant of PB activity against P. aeruginosa DK2 and led to the development of a synergistic compound 15 (Fig.\u00a01)12. However, compound 15 was limited by high cytotoxicity, uncertain in\u00a0vivo efficacy, and an unclear synergistic mechanism.Figure\u00a01Structural design and optimization strategy.Figure\u00a01\nIn this study, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of derivatives based on compound 15 to improve synergistic potency and druggability, with a focus on derivative A22 (Fig.\u00a01). It demonstrated significant in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo synergistic activity to PB against P. aeruginosa DK2. Additionally, in combination with PB, derivative A22 exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against other clinical drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Mechanistic studies revealed that derivative A22 enhances PB activity by inducing excessive ROS production, reducing ATP production, increasing NOX activity, and inhibiting biofilm formation, ultimately leading to bacterial death.\n\n## Materials and methods\nThe clinical P. aeruginosa DK2 isolate was provided by Professor Lars Jelsbak of Technical University of Denmark. A. Baumannii 186 and K. Pneumoniae 674 isolates were provided by Professor of Min Li of Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. E. Coli 15,017 was provided by Professor of YouJun Feng, Zhejiang University. K. Pneumoniae 15,004, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae 107, Enterobacter asburiae 184, A. baumannii 186 and Serratia arcescens were provided by Professor Hongyan Hu, Hainan Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital. P. aeruginosa PAO1 isolate was from ATCC (https://www.atcc.org).\n\n## Synthesis and characterization of \nThe details of the synthesis and characterization of A1\u2013A30 were employed in this manuscript and Supporting Information The purity of all derivatives was determined by HPLC >95% (Supporting Information Table\u00a0S1). The 1H NMR, HRMS and HPLC spectra for each derivative were provided in Supporting Information Figs. S4\u2013S33.\n\n## Antibiotic efficacy test\nThe in\u00a0vitro antimicrobial activity of all derivatives/antibiotics was evaluated by the micro broth dilution method, as described previously12. In brief, bacterial cultures were diluted with fresh Cation-Adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB, BD, CA, USA) to OD600 of 0.001. Derivatives/antibiotics were 2-fold serially diluted in bacterial cultures in the 96-well plate and incubated with equal volumes of inoculum for 18\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Then, MIC values were measured by recording the optical density at 600\u00a0nm (OD600) of each well using BioTek Synergy 2 (BioTek, VT, USA). MIC values were recorded as the lowest concentration required to achieve 100% growth inhibition compared to growth in untreated wells.\n\n## Chessboard assay\nIn\u00a0vitro synergetic activity was evaluated in 96-well plates by the checkerboard microdilution method. In brief, bacterial cultures were diluted with fresh CAMHB (BD) to OD600 of 0.001 and were plated in a 96-well culture plate at 100 \u03bcL/well. Antibiotics and derivatives to be measured were added to the 96-well plate, and the checkerboard method was used for determination. The concentration range was 0.25\u201332\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, and the final concentration range of derivatives was 5\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (continuous 2-fold change). The plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 18\u00a0h and measured by optical density at OD600. The value of FIC was calculated as Eq. (1):(1)FIC=[MICoftheagentsincombination]/[MICoftheagentalone]\nThe FICI is the sum of the FICs of the derivatives and antibiotics.\n\n## Time-kill assay\nThe detailed method for time-kill assay was previously described12.\n\n## Mammalian cytotoxicity\nCells were seeded in 96-well plates at 10,000\u00a0cells per well in a total volume of 100\u00a0\u03bcL of media containing 10% serum. Serially diluted compounds in 10\u00a0\u03bcL of media were added to the cells 24\u00a0h later. After 1 day of incubation, Cell Counting Kit-8 reagents (CCK8, Yeasen, Shanghai, China) were added, and luminescence was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell viability was measured by CCK8 assay of 293\u00a0T and HUVEC cells line. The data are presented as a percentage of viable cells with vehicle-treated cells set as 100.\n\n## Water solubility assay\nThe derivative was dissolved in HPLC-grade methanol and diluted in a gradient to 0.56, 0.28, 0.14, 0.07, 0.035, 0.018, 0.0088, 0.0044, 0.0022, and 0.0011\u00a0mg/mL of the solution. The UV absorption peak area in 254\u00a0nm was measured by HPLC to construct the concentration\u2013UV absorption area standard curve. Add an excess of the derivatives into water to form a supersaturated solution. After stirring for 24\u00a0h, the UV absorption peak area in 254\u00a0nm was measured by HPLC, and then the water solubility value of the derivative was calculated from the previous standard curve.\n\n## Plasma protein binding assay\nThis experiment was outsourced to Pharmalegacy Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Briefly, aliquots of 100\u00a0\u03bcL of blank dialysis buffer were applied to the receiver side of the dialysis chambers. Then 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the plasma spiked with test compounds was applied to the donor side. Preparing T0 plasma samples for initial concentrations. Aliquot 25\u00a0\u03bcL of the plasma spiked with test and reference compounds was added to the 96-well sample preparation plate as T0 plasma samples. The samples were added blank buffer. Quench the samples with 200\u00a0\u03bcL of acetonitrile containing internal standard. Cover the dialysis block with a plastic lid and place the entire apparatus for 5\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After 5\u00a0h of incubation, aliquots of 25\u00a0\u03bcL were taken from both the donor and receiver sides of the dialysis apparatus and transferred into new sample preparation plates. Each aliquot was then mixed with an equal volume of the opposite matrix (blank buffer for plasma and plasma for blank buffer). Quench the samples with 200\u00a0\u03bcL acetonitrile containing internal standard. Vortex all the samples at 500\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min followed by centrifugation at 4000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The transfer of 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the supernatants to a new 96-well plate and mix the samples with 200\u00a0\u03bcL of Milli-Q water. Cover the\u00a0sample plate and store it in a freezer (\u221220\u00a0\u00b0C) until LC\u2013MS/MS analysis.\n\n## hERG channel Qpatch assay\nThis experiment was commissioned by the ion channel platform of Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). The inhibitory activity of test compounds on hERG potassium channels was tested in CHO-hERG cells, which were cultured in 175\u00a0cm2 culture flasks. Cell density was ranged within 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u20125\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells/mL. The single-cell high-impedance sealing and whole-cell pattern formation processes are automatically completed by the Qpatch instrument. After acquiring whole-cell recording mode, cells were clamped at \u221280 mV. The voltage stimulation was applied every 15\u00a0s and recorded for 2\u00a0min, and the extracellular fluid was administered for 5\u00a0min, and then the administration process was started. Each test concentration was given for 2.5\u00a0min starting from low concentrations to high concentrations. Cisapride was used as a positive control.\n\n## Stability test in liver microsomes assay\nCompounds were incubated with human, or mouse liver microsomes and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in 0.05\u00a0mol/L phosphate buffer (pH\u00a0=\u00a07.4) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 0\u201360\u00a0min. The reaction was quenched, and the amount of the remaining compound was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS).\n\n## The human CYP450 enzymes inhibition assay\nThis experiment was outsourced to Pharmalegacy Laboratories Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the coenzyme NADPH (6.5\u00a0mmol/L). Prepare probe substrate and HLM/MLM mixture in a 96-well plate according to the appropriate proportion. Probe substrate (318\u00a0\u03bcL) and human liver microsome mixture were dispensed to the incubation plates. Then add 2\u00a0\u03bcL of 8 serial concentration levels, and then add 80\u00a0\u03bcL aliquot of the NADPH regenerating system as 0\u00a0min to initiate the reaction. The sample plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and started a timer. The assay plates for testing inhibition of different CYP isoforms were incubated for different periods of time: 10\u00a0min for 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4; 40\u00a0min for 2C19). At time points, 100\u00a0\u03bcL incubation solution was transferred to the wells of the corresponding plates containing 300\u00a0\u03bcL of internal standard solution, respectively, to stop the reaction. After quenching, shake the plates for 10\u00a0min and centrifuge the samples at 3000\u00d7g for 15\u00a0min, and 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the supernatant was transferred from each well to a 96-well sample plate containing 300\u00a0\u03bcL of water for LC\u2013MS/MS analysis.\n\nWild-type C. elegans (N2) strains were obtained from Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (MN, USA). The age-synchronized L4 larvae were transferred and incubated on peptone-glucose-sorbitol (PGS) agar plates (containing PAO1 strain) for 24\u00a0h at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. PAO1 trains cells at midlogarithmic phase (OD600\u223c0.5) were harvested and diluted with S-Buffer to OD600 of 2, then 2\u00a0mL of bacterial solution was added to PGS agar plates. Infected N2 worms were washed with M9 buffer, resuspended, and then washed again with M9 buffer (1\u00a0L ddH2O, 5\u00a0g NaCl, 6\u00a0g Na2HPO4. 3\u00a0g KH2PO4, and 1\u00a0mL 1\u00a0mol/L MgSO4). Approximately 20 worms were transferred to 24-well plates (containing compounds to be tested or not, and 0.2\u00a0mmol/L floxuridine to prevent the worms from spawning). The number of worms (live or dead) was recorded every day.\n\n## Mice infection assay\nA murine wound infection model in BALB/c female mice (6\u20138 week, 20\u201322\u00a0g) was established, and healthy mice were provided by Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Derivative A22 was dissolved in saline containing 0.1% Tween 80 and PB was prepared in saline. First, mice were anesthetized with 4% chloral hydrate and then shaved on the back. A \u223c5\u00a0mm wound was created on the back of the mice and then 30\u00a0\u03bcL of P. aeruginosa DK2 (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0CFU) was inoculated on the surface of the wound. Surrounded by 48\u00a0h of wound infection, the wound was treated with saline, PB alone, or PB in combination with derivative A22, respectively. The drugs were administered twice a day. Then, a homogenate of the skin at the wound site was prepared and the bacterial density was determined CFU counting was obtained on an agar plate. Meanwhile, the wounds and body weights of the mice were monitored daily. After Day 5, the surviving mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Wounds were removed and homogenized in sterile PBS for bacterial loading. All experimental procedures were executed according to the protocols approved by the Hainan University Animal Research Committee (SYXK2023-0031).\n\n## Resistance assay\nThe detailed method for resistance assay was previously described12. Briefly, the ability of the combination of PB and derivative A22 to suppress resistance development was determined by serial passaging. P. aeruginosa DK2 with approximately OD\u00a0=\u00a00.01 was grown in 3\u00a0mL of LB broth with a sub-MIC (1/2 MIC) concentration of PB alone or in combination with derivative A22. At 24\u00a0h intervals, the cultures were assessed for growth. A bacterial dilution was made by using the bacteria from the sub-MIC concentration of PB (1/2 MIC). Then, the concentration of these bacteria was adjusted to OD\u00a0=\u00a00.01 and subjected to the next MIC assay. The tubes were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. For the PB and A22 combination group, the concentration of derivative A22 was kept constant at 10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L throughout the experiment. This serial passaging was repeated for 14 days, and the fold change in the MIC value was determined.\n\n## qPCR analysis assay\nBacterial cells were cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in LB broth to the logarithmic-growth phase (OD600\u00a0=\u00a01.0). Cells were collected by centrifugation, and total RNA was extracted using an Eastep Super Total RNA Extraction Kit (Hlingene, Shanghai, China). cDNA synthesis was performed using a Hifair III One Step RT-qPCR SYBR Green Kit (Yeasen, Shanghai, China). Primers for RT-qPCR were listed in Supporting Information Table\u00a0S2. The RT-qPCR (Thermo Fisher, QuantStudio\u2122 1, MA, USA) experiments were performed on a Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeasen, Shanghai, China). The relative expression levels of the target genes were calculated using the comparative CT (2\u2013\u0394\u0394CT) method13.\n\n## Oxidative stress sensitivity measurement\nDilute the bacteria to 0.01 and treat the bacteria with compounds. When the OD600 of the bacteria reaches 1.0, collect 3\u00a0mL of bacteria liquid, and resuspend and centrifuge (JIDI, JIDI-21\u00a0R, Guangzhou, China) with 1\u00a0mL of sterile 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0PBS buffer. Then, PBS containing 0.2\u00a0mol/L H2O2 was added to resuspend the organisms, and constant temperature was shaken for 15\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Afterward, the number of DK2 strains was determined by the gradient dilution coated plate method and plate colony counting method. The suspension of test bacteria was diluted 101\u2013107 times using sterile 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0PBS, respectively, and 5\u00a0\u03bcL of the diluted suspension was taken in LB solid medium spot plates, which were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in an incubator for days 1\u20132, after the number of colonies on the plates was counted and recorded, and the CFU to analyze the susceptibility to oxidative stress14.\n\n## Bacterial ATP level assay\nThe ATP content in bacteria was detected by Solarbio ATP Content Detection Kit (Solarbio, BC0300, Beijing, China), and the strains were treated with the compounds singly and in combination, when OD600\u00a0=\u00a01.0, 2\u00a0mL of bacterial liquid was collected and centrifuged, 1\u00a0mL of extraction solution was added, and ultrasonically crushed in an ice bath, and then ATP was extracted from bacteria according to the instructions, and put on the ice to be measured. The samples were added into 96-well plates according to the instructions, and after mixing thoroughly, the absorbance value A1 at 340\u00a0nm for 10\u00a0s was measured immediately, and then the 96-well plates were placed in an incubator at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min, and then the absorbance value A2 at 3\u00a0min for 10\u00a0s was measured immediately. The relative ATP levels was calculated15.\n\n## Intracellular NADH oxidase assay\nThe NADH oxidase (NOX) content in bacteria was assayed using the Solarbio NOX activity assay kit (Solarbio, BC0630, Beijing, China). The strains were treated with the compounds singly and in combination, and 1\u00a0mL of the bacteria was collected when OD600\u00a0=\u00a01.0, and the NOX activity was measured by the extraction method according to the instructions of the kit. Calculate the relative NOX activity16.\n\n## Intracellular ROS detection\nIn this experiment, a Beyotime reactive oxygen detection kit (Beyotime, S0033S, Shanghai, China) was used, bacteria were treated with the drug, and the organisms were collected, DCFH-DA was diluted according to 1:1000, so that the final concentration was 10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L. The organisms were collected and suspended in diluted DCFH-DA, incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min; the organisms were resuspended with LB medium, and then centrifuged at 5000\u00a0rpm (JIDI-21\u00a0R) for 5\u00a0min, and washed to remove the DCFH-DA that had not entered into the cells. The organisms were centrifuged at 5000\u00a0rpm (JIDI-21\u00a0R) for 5\u00a0min, washed, and the DCFH-DA that did not enter the cells was removed. 488\u00a0nm excitation wavelength and 525\u00a0nm emission wavelength were used for the zymography detection17.\n\n## Biofilm production assay\nSingle colonies were inoculated in LB culture solution and cultured overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 200\u00a0rpm (MIULAB, ES-60\u00a0E, Hangzhou, China). Determine the OD600 value of the bacterial liquid and dilute the bacterial liquid with LB until OD600\u00a0=\u00a00.01. The diluted bacterial solution was treated by compounds alone and combined with polymyxin B respectively. Bacterial cells were inoculated 1:100 in CPG medium in 96-well polystyrene plates. After incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (CV) for 30\u00a0min. The planktonic cells were removed by several rinses with H2O. The CV-stained bound cells were air dried for 1\u00a0h and then dissolved in 95% ethanol, and the optical density at 570\u00a0nm (OD570) of the solution was measured to quantify biofilm formation18.\n\n## Confocal laser scanning microscopy assay\nCover glass was placed in a six-well plate, and the strain was treated with the compound. The biofilms formed on the coverslips were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.2) and then dried at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The biofilms were stained with a 0.01% acridine orange (Macklin, 65-61-2, Shanghai, China) and ethidium bromide solution (Macklin, 25,535-16-4, Shanghai, China) for 15\u00a0min and observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Olympus, FV3000, Japan)19.\n\n## RNA-seq analysis assay\nTotal RNA was extracted from P. aeruginosa DK2 by using the Eastep Super Total RNA Extraction Kit. RNA purity was detected by using the Nano Photometer spectrophotometer (Bio-DL, Mico Drop Shanghai, China), RNA concentration was measured by using Qubit RNA Assay Kit in Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Qubit 2.0, MA, USA), and RNA integrity was assessed by using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit with the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, 2100 system, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were generated by using the NEB. Next, Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, E7760S, MA, USA). Finally, the products were purified (Beckman Coulter, AMPure XP system, CA, USA), and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina, CA, USA). After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform, and paired-end reads were generated. Trimmed sequence reads were aligned to the P. aeruginosa DK2 genome sequence using Bowtie2-2.2.3, and normalized read counts were compared using HTSeq v0.6.1 as described previously. Then, the FPKM of each gene was calculated based on 26 reads of the gene, and the read count was mapped for each gene20,21.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 8. The data are presented as the means\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD). Asterisks in the figures indicate corresponding statistical significance.\n\n## Design and chemistry\nBuilding on the structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) insights from NIC and compound 15, we identified that the presence of two benzene rings and the 2-hydroxyl and 5-fluoro substitutions on the left benzene ring were crucial for synergistic potency12,22. Modifications, including the introduction of new linkers and substituents on the right benzene ring, were modulated to enhance synergistic activity, reduce cytotoxicity, and improve druggability (Fig.\u00a01).\nA range of linker types, including sulfonamide, urea, and hydrazide amide, were introduced to modulate electronic and steric properties. Besides, research has shown that incorporating additional carbon atoms and amino acid linkers can enhance the flexibility and pharmacokinetic profiles of compounds23. Then, various bulky bis-amide linkers were inserted into the benzene rings. Moreover, substituents were strategically introduced at different positions on the right benzene ring. Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., trifluoromethyl, nitro, etc.) and electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, hydroxyl, etc.) were introduced at the ortho, meta, and para positions to modulate electronic properties, enhance synergistic potential and minimize mammalian cytotoxicity.

HCl, r.t., 3\u00a0h.Scheme 4\nSpecifically, the synthesis of target derivatives A1\u2013A4 is depicted in Scheme 1. The intermediate M1 was synthesized via a nucleophilic substitution starting from commercially available 5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride (1). M1 was then reacted with commercially available 2-chloro-1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene (4) in the presence of potassium carbonate, yielding intermediate M2. Concurrently, commercially available 5-fluoro-2-methoxyaniline (2) was treated with triphosgene and triethylamine to generate isocyanic acid, which was subsequently reacted with 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (3) to give the urea intermediate M3. Intermediate M4 was obtained through the nucleophilic substitution reaction of 4, followed by condensation with commercially available 5-fluoro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (20) to give the intermediate M5. Additionally, commercially available 2-(5-fluoro-2-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid (5) underwent a condensation with 3 to produce the intermediate M6. Finally, demethylation of the key intermediates, M2, M3, M5, and M6, produced derivatives A1\u2013A4, respectively.\nThe synthesis of compounds A5\u2013A15 is shown in Scheme 2. Using PCl3 as the acylating agent, various commercially available substituted amino acids (6\u201316) were coupled with 3 to produce intermediates M7\u2013M17. These intermediates were then deprotected from Fmoc in the presence of piperidine in acetonitrile to generate intermediates M18\u2013M28. Condensation of intermediates M18\u2013M28 with 20 in the presence of EDCI produced M29\u2013M39, which were subsequently demethylated using BBr3 to afford the corresponding derivatives A5\u2013A15.\nAs shown in Scheme 3, intermediates M40\u2013M41 were prepared by nucleophilic substitution of 4 with various substituted amines, followed by deprotecting the BOC group using trifluoroacetic acid to yield intermediates M42\u2013M43. Condensation of intermediates M42\u2013M43 with 20 in the presence of EDCI and DMAP or HOBt produced intermediates M44\u2013M45, respectively, which were then demethylated using BBr3 to afford the corresponding derivatives A16\u2013A17.\nAs described in Scheme 4, the direct coupling of commercially available 5-fluoro-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (19) and 2,4-dimethoxyaniline afforded the derivative A18. Derivative A19 was accessed under similar coupling conditions by condensation of 19 with 2-methoxy-4-nitroaniline, followed by demethylation with BBr3 to yield derivative A20. Commercially available 2,4-bis(trifluoromethyl)aniline reacted with sodium nitrite in the presence of SnCl2 and concentrated HCl to give hydrazine intermediate M55. Subsequent condensation of the intermediate M55, or various substituted aniline, with 20 yielded intermediates M46\u2013M54 and M56, respectively, which were then subjected to demethylation using BBr3 to give derivatives A21\u2013A30.\n\n## Evaluation of derivatives for antibacterial activity against \nAdjuvants were typically defined as compounds that lack direct antimicrobial activity or exhibit minimal inhibition of bacterial growth but enhance the inhibitory effect of antibiotics7. Therefore, all target derivatives A1\u2013A30 were evaluated for their in\u00a0vitro antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa DK2 using the broth-dilution method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the concentration at which there was approximately 100% reduction in bacterial growth compared to the drug-free control. The antibacterial activity results were tabulated in Table\u00a01, Table\u00a02. As expected, the majority of the derivatives were inactive against P. aeruginosa DK2, with MIC values exceeding 1000\u00a0\u03bcmol/L. Only compounds A3, A20, A25, and A28\u2013A30 demonstrated moderate antibacterial activity, with MIC values ranging from 50 to 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L.Table\u00a01Structures and synergistic activity of the lead compound 15 and derivatives A1\u2013A17.Table\u00a01Table\u00a02Structures and synergistic activity of derivatives A18\u2013A30.Table\u00a02\n\n## Evaluation of derivatives for synergistic activity to PB against \nThe synergistic activity of derivatives was assessed using the checkerboard microdilution assay. The synergistic effects were evaluated by the fractional inhibitory concentration (FICI), with synergism defined as a FICI \u2264 0.524. The FICI was calculated by summing the ratios with the MIC of each drug in combination to the MIC of the drug when used individually. As shown in Table\u00a01, derivatives A1\u2013A3, incorporating sulfonamide, urea, and hydrazide amide linkers, demonstrated a reduction in synergistic activity (FICI range: 0.108\u20130.204) compared to the lead compound 15 (FICI\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Notably, derivative A3 (10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), featuring a novel amido hydrazine linker, significantly improved the MIC of PB from 256 to 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, below the clinical sensitivity threshold (MIC \u22642\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). However, A3 exhibited weak antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa DK2, with a MIC of 50\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (16.28\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), raising concerns about potential drug resistance after long-term usage. Derivatives A4\u2013A17 exhibited synergistic activity against P. aeruginosa DK2 at concentrations of 10\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (FICI\u00a0=\u00a00.026\u20130.204). Unfortunately, none surpassed the performance of 15. The results indicated that the introduction of sulfonamide, urea, various diamine, and amino acid linkers led to a reduction in synergetic activity. Additionally, derivatives with bulky linkers (A6, A10\u2013A11) were explored and resulted in a complete loss of synergetic activity (MIC of PB\u00a0>\u00a032\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Overall, the amide linker was found to be crucial for maintaining synergetic activity.\nDue to the weak potency observed, further optimization of the linker moiety was not pursued. Subsequently, our focus shifted to examining the impact of substitutions on the right benzene ring (Fig.\u00a01). To explore the effects of introducing various electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, derivatives A18\u2013A30 were synthesized and evaluated (Table\u00a02). Initially, derivative A18, featuring a 2\u2032\u2013OCH3-4\u2032\u2013OCH3 substitution, led to a significant loss of synergistic activity. Additionally, the 2\u2032\u2013Cl substituent was replaced with 2\u2032\u2013OCH3 or 2\u2032\u2013OH to yield derivatives A19\u2013A20, both of which exhibited limited potency (FICI\u00a0=\u00a00.018 and 0.258, respectively). This suggests that the introduction of electron-donating groups adversely affects synergistic activity. Further exploration with various electron-withdrawing substituents (A21\u2013A29), such as \u2013CF3, \u2013CN, \u2013SO2CF3, and \u2013NO2 revealed improved synergistic activity\u00a0(FICI <0.5) across all derivatives. Notably, electron-withdrawing substitutions at the 2\u2032,4\u2032-position exerted favorable effects on activity. Among these, derivative A22, with bis(trifluoromethyl) substitution, maintained potency (FICI\u00a0=\u00a00.014) comparable to lead compound 15, enhancing the MIC of PB from 256 to 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, while itself exhibiting no inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa DK2 (MIC >1000\u00a0\u03bcmol/L). Conversely, derivative A23, with 3\u2032,5\u2032-bis(trifluoromethyl) substitution, demonstrated lightly reduced synergetic activity (FICI\u00a0=\u00a00.026) compared to A22. These results suggested that 2\u2032,4\u2032-substitution with electron-withdrawing groups played a crucial role in modulating synergetic activity. Further substitut",
