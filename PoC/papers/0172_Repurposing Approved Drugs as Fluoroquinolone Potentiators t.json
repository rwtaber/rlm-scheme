  "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile human commensal bacteria and pathogen that causes various community and hospital-acquired infections. The S. aureus efflux pump NorA which belongs to the major facilitator superfamily, confers resistance to a range of substrates. Many efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) have been discovered, but none is clinically approved due to their undesirable toxicities. In this study, we have screened clinically approved drugs for possible NorA EPI-like activity. We identified six drugs that showed the best efflux pump inhibition in vitro, with a fractional inhibitory concentration index of \u22640.5, indicating synergism with hydrophilic fluoroquinolones. The mechanistic validation of efflux inhibitory potential was demonstrated in ethidium bromide-based accumulation and efflux inhibition assays. We further confirmed the functionality of EPIs by norfloxacin accumulation assay depicting more realistic proof of the conjecture. None of the EPIs disturbed membrane function or depleted the ATP synthesis levels in bacteria. Both raloxifene and pyrvinium displayed an increase in bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in time-kill kinetics, prolonged its post-antibiotic effect, and reduced the frequency of spontaneous resistant mutant development. The combination of EPIs with ciprofloxacin caused significant eradication of preformed biofilms. Moreover, in the murine thigh infection model, a single dose of pyrvinium combined with ciprofloxacin reduced the bacterial burden significantly compared to untreated control and ciprofloxacin alone, indicating the efficacy of the combination. Conclusively, this study represents approved drugs that can be repurposed and combined with antibiotics as NorA EPIs, having anti-biofilm properties to treat severe S. aureus infections at clinically relevant concentrations. IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent pathogen bacterium and the predominant cause of worsened nosocomial infections. Efflux pumps contribute to drug efflux and are reportedly associated with biofilm formation, thereby promoting difficult-to-treat biofilm-associated S. aureus infections. One strategy to combat these bacteria is to reduce active efflux and increase pathogen sensitivity to existing antibiotics. Repurposing approved drugs may solve the classical toxicity issues with previous efflux pump inhibitors and help reach sufficient plasma concentrations. We describe the in silico-based screening of FDA-approved drugs that identified six different molecules able to inhibit NorA pump (Major Facilitator Superfamily). Our study highlights that these compounds bind to and block the activity of the NorA pump and increase the sensitivity of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus to fluoroquinolones. These drugs combined with fluoroquinolones significantly reduced the preformed biofilms and displayed significant efficacy in the murine thigh infection model when compared to untreated control and ciprofloxacin alone.",

  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nStaphylococcus aureus is a frequent human commensal bacterium and the foremost cause of bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and skin and soft tissue infections. It has become a prime cause of steadily increasing health care-associated infections imposing an elevated burden on health care resources. Moreover, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounts for 12% of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the adult population and is among the three most frequently reported pathogens contributing to HAIs, according to a report of the National Healthcare Safety Network (1). The pathogenic potential of S. aureus is not only limited to planktonic bacteria but also extends to biofilms. Progressively, it has developed the ability to promptly develop resistance to any antibiotic by using various resistance mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic, alteration of the target, trapping of the antibiotic, and efflux pumps (2).\nContrary to other resistance mechanisms, efflux-mediated resistance has recently gathered more interest in S. aureus, as many bacterial efflux pumps can expel several unrelated classes of antimicrobials, thereby promoting multi-drug resistance. The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pumps are abundant and the most diverse family of transporters present in S. aureus (3). The MFS superfamily\u2019s members are predominantly monomeric proteins with lengths ranging from 388 to 600 amino acids. They possess 12\u201314 transmembrane helices that form two domains, and each domain is composed of bundles of six helices. It includes uniporters (transport of substrates without coupling ions across the bilayer) and symporters (the unidirectional coupled substrate-ion transport across the bilayer) (3). NorA in S. aureus, which is chromosomally coded by the norA gene, is one of the most researched MFS efflux pumps. NorA is a protein comprising 388 amino acids, 12 transmembrane segments and transports the antimicrobial agents across the cell membrane using the proton motive force (drug/H+ antiport) (4). It can extrude various chemically and structurally different compounds, such as dyes like ethidium bromide (EtBr), hydrophilic fluoroquinolones, i.e., norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and biocides such as quaternary ammonium compounds. The clinical significance of NorA efflux pumps can be estimated by a study indicating a high prevalence of norA gene expression in bloodstream S. aureus isolates (5). Some earlier studies have reported the over-expression of norA efflux pump gene in the fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates (6, 7).\nEfflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) work as potentiators of existing antibiotics and help in a reversal of intrinsic and acquired resistance in bacteria (8, 9). Many EPIs have been discovered in the past years, e.g., reserpine, but none is clinically approved due to their unavoidable toxicities (10, 11).\nThe rate of spread of resistance is swift, which is further assisted by the dried antibiotic pipeline. A possible strategy is to evaluate the efficacy of previously approved antibiotics. The previously approved drugs can be explored as potentiators with known antibiotics. The already assessed pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dosing range make the drugs\u2019 repurposing beneficial. Considering the clinical significance of NorA efflux pump, a NorA inhibitor-antibiotic combination therapy could be a promising alternative to tackle multi-drug resistance.\nIn this study, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved small molecule drugs library was screened for possible inhibitory potential against the NorA pump. We shortlisted six EPI-like drugs through virtual screening followed by in vitro antibiotic potentiation assays. This study also demonstrates the remarkable potency of our best EPI, i.e., pyrvinium combined with ciprofloxacin in a murine thigh infection model. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an approved drug that can be used as an EPI in vivo and to reduce biofilm formation at clinically achievable concentrations.\n\n## Virtual screening and molecular docking to the active site of NorA.\nThe FDA-approved drug library (1,965 drugs) was docked against the entire surface of the NorA homology model, and the free energies, as well as the Molecular Mechanics energies combined with the Generalized Born and Surface Area continuum solvation (MM-GBSA) scores of the best binding poses, were calculated (Table\u00a0S1). The molecular modeling studies revealed multiple FDA-approved drugs as potential binders with high binding scores. The initial virtual screening using in silico molecular docking followed by in vitro screening (\u223c300 compounds) utilized in this study identified six potential hits, i.e., raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium. Among the compounds, raloxifene showed the highest docking and MM-GBSA score of \u20139.064\u2009kcal/mol and \u201370.08\u2009kcal/mol, respectively, while chlorprothixene exhibited the lowest docking score of \u20133.757\u2009kcal/mol. Based on MM-GBSA based binding energy calculations, all six compounds have NorA binding potential in the order of raloxifene > nefazodone > ezetimibe > chlorprothixene > propafenone > pyrvinium. The moderate to high docking and MMGBSA scores suggest that these drugs may have favorable interactions and inhibit NorA activity. The important NorA interacting residues are Asn340, Phe16, Gln51, Thr336, and Phe140, forming hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions with the compounds and stabilizing their interaction with the binding core (Fig.\u00a01).\n\n## The compounds do not influence the natural growth kinetics of bacteria.\nBacterial growth kinetics is an autocatalytic reaction depicting direct proportionality between growth rate and the concentration of cells (12). We have assessed the effect of 1/4\u2009\u00d7\u2009MICs of compounds, i.e., raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium on primitive bacterial growth kinetics of S. aureus SA-1199B. Ideally, they should not alter typical bacterial growth patterns at sub-inhibitory concentrations. None of the compounds affected the typical growth pattern of bacteria; no difference was observed compared to the control group (Fig.\u00a0S1).\n\n## Repurposed drugs reverse fluoroquinolones resistance phenotype.\nNext, we performed a checkerboard synergy assay on S. aureus SA-1199B (norA over-expressed strain), S. aureus SA-1199 (wild-type), and S. aureus K1758 (norA deletion strain) to determine the synergistic activity of compounds in combination with ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. The MICs of compounds, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin were determined against various strains used in the study. The results indicate that compounds at sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/4\u2009\u00d7\u2009MICs), i.e., raloxifene (50\u2009\u03bcM), ezetimibe (50\u2009\u03bcM), propafenone (50\u2009\u03bcM), nefazodone (50\u2009\u03bcM), chlorprothixene (50\u2009\u03bcM), and pyrvinium (0.39\u2009\u03bcM) modulated the MIC of ciprofloxacin for S. aureus SA-1199B by 8\u201316-fold. Moreover, the same concentrations in combination with norfloxacin modulated the norfloxacin\u2019s MIC by 4\u201316-fold (Table\u00a01). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) of all compounds at 1/4\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC was \u22640.5, which indicates synergy. Most importantly, raloxifene, ezetimibe, and pyrvinium displayed better synergistic activity than reserpine (used as a positive control due to known NorA efflux inhibitory activity). The concentration-dependent potentiation effect was observed for all the compounds (Fig.\u00a02). However, for S. aureus SA-1199 (wild-type), the compounds at sub-inhibitory concentrations, i.e., raloxifene (50\u2009\u03bcM), ezetimibe (50\u2009\u03bcM), propafenone (50\u2009\u03bcM), nefazodone (50\u2009\u03bcM), chlorprothixene (50\u2009\u03bcM), and pyrvinium (0.39\u2009\u03bcM) modulated the MIC of ciprofloxacin by 2\u20134-fold, and the MIC of norfloxacin by 2\u20134-fold (Table S2). The relatively weak modulation effect is attributed to the basal level expression of NorA efflux pump in wild-type S. aureus (SA-1199). The synergism with antibiotics can be due to the NorA efflux pump inhibition; to confirm this conjecture, we also determined the synergism on the norA deletion strain (Table\u00a01). None of the compounds displayed a significant reduction in the MIC of ciprofloxacin, and we can consider the compounds as NorA EPIs.\nFor the reader-friendly visualization of the synergy, we designed an agar plate-based disc-diffusion assay. As expected, compounds alone (raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium) at sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/4\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC) did not show any zone of growth inhibition. The disc of ciprofloxacin alone produced a zone of growth inhibition of 20\u2009mm in diameter. In the combination, the zone of growth inhibition increased up to \u223c 4\u20136\u2009mm (Fig.\u00a03A). Also, the discs with synergistic concentrations (concentrations of ciprofloxacin to which its MIC is reduced in the presence of compounds) of ciprofloxacin, i.e., 0.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml and 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml, did not display any growth inhibition zone. However, the combination of ciprofloxacin and compounds produced a zone of \u223c16\u2009mm for each combination set, which represents synergy (Fig.\u00a03B).\nFurthermore, the synergistic activity of the combination against clinical strains of MRSA was determined. The combination of all six compounds with ciprofl oxacin reduced its MIC by 2\u201332-fold, thereby increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to ciprofloxacin (Table\u00a02). Moreover, we performed a checkerboard synergy assay with moxifloxacin against the strain over-expressing NorA (S. aureus SA-1199B) and against S. aureus clinical strains. NorA efflux pump extrudes a variety of substrates, including hydrophilic fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin) except hydrophobic fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin). Moxifloxacin is a known substrate of NorB efflux pump (13) and not NorA efflux pump. We observed that none of all six compounds exhibited synergy with moxifloxacin (Table S3, Table S4). Moreover, no synergism was observed in a strain expressing TetK (S. aureus XU212) when the compounds were combined with the antibiotic substrate of the efflux pump, i.e., tetracycline (Table S3). Altogether these results suggest that NorA is a target of the compounds in the study.\n\n## The EPIs inhibited EtBr efflux.\nTo further confirm that the synergism observed in the checkerboard synergy assay is due to the efflux inhibition, we performed the real-time EtBr accumulation assay on S. aureus SA-1199B. EtBr is a known substrate of several chromosomally encoded efflux pumps, which binds to DNA and fluoresce. We observed a concentration-dependent increase in EtBr accumulation compared to the control when treated with six hit-compounds individually (Fig.\u00a04A to G). The increase in dye accumulation indicates the halted extrusion of dye due to NorA efflux pump inhibition.\nFurthermore, the compounds\u2019 potential to inhibit EtBr extrusion from S. aureus SA-1199B was determined. The increased expression of the NorA efflux pump caused rapid extrusion of EtBr, due to which a decrease in fluorescence was observed. However, the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/4\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC) of compounds (raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium) significantly slowed EtBr extrusion compared to the untreated control in S. aureus SA-1199B (Fig.\u00a04H to N). The addition of glucose re-energizes the cells and promotes active efflux, and thereby reduced the efflux pump inhibitory potential of compounds (14) (Fig. S2). To further confirm the specificity of compounds as NorA efflux pump inhibitors, the EtBr efflux from S. aureus K1758 (norA deletion) was assessed. It was observed that none of the compounds significantly slowed down the EtBr extrusion both in the presence or absence of glucose. For the treated sets, no significant difference from the control group was observed (Fig. S3). Based on both the assays, the potential of the compounds to promote accumulation and inhibit the efflux of EtBr is in the order of pyrvinium >raloxifene >ezetimibe >propafenone \u223cnefazodone \u223cchlorprothixene.\nAdditionally, we performed a norfloxacin accumulation assay on S. aureus SA-1199B treated with EPIs to obtain more realistic evidence of the NorA efflux pump inhibition. The fluorescence measurement monitors the uptake of norfloxacin when it accumulates inside the cell (15). The results portray a significant increase in the norfloxacin accumulation in the EPIs (raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium) treated cells compared to reserpine and untreated control (Fig.\u00a05A). The compound\u2019s potential to promote norfloxacin accumulation is in the order of pyrvinium >raloxifene >ezetimibe >propafenone >nefazodone >chlorprothixene, based on norfloxacin accumulation assay.\n\n## The EPIs do not alter membrane permeability.\nThe effect of compounds on membrane permeability of S. aureus SA-1199B was assessed using propidium iodide (PI) to rule out the likelihood of synergy due to any off-target effects. PI is a fluorescent dye that binds to double-stranded nucleic acids and is usually membrane-impermeable (12). Any alteration in membrane permeability caused by the presence of EPIs causes the dye to permeate cells and display an increase in fluorescence (16). No significant increase in fluorescence in the presence of EPIs (raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium) was observed, which indicates no membrane permeabilization. However, a drastic increase in fluorescence was observed in the cells treated with paenibacillin (positive control) (17) compared to the untreated control (Fig.\u00a05B).\n\n## The EPIs cause no membrane depolarization.\nTo determine the effect of EPIs on the membrane depolarization, we used 3, 3\u2032-Dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5)), for assay against S. aureus SA-1199B. DiSC3(5) is a voltage-sensitive dye, a fluorescent molecular probe. The fluorescence of DiSC3(5) decreases as the dye partitions to the surface of polarized cells; depolarization prevents partitioning and can release bound dye into the media (18). None of the EPIs (raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium) had any significant effect on bacterial membranes, as they allowed stabilization of the quenched dye, revealing little to no depolarization. In contrast, the cells treated with valinomycin (positive control) displayed a drastic increase in fluorescence compared to untreated control, indicating membrane depolarization (Fig.\u00a05C).\n\n## The EPIs do not cause bacterial ATP depletion.\nAny transition from normal membrane functions can destabilize the respiratory chain and lead to reduced ATP levels (12, 19). Any alteration in bacterial ATP synthesis levels 4 h post-treatment with EPIs (six-hit compounds) alone was evaluated to exclude the possibility of ATP depletion as EPIs functional mechanism. Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and valinomycin, known for energy depletion, were included as positive controls (20, 21). In the presence of EPIs, no depletion in the bacterial ATP levels was observed. In contrast, significant disruption of ATP synthesis in the CCCP and valinomycin treated cells was observed compared to untreated control (Fig.\u00a05D).\n\n## Effect of EPIs on time-kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin.\nThe time-kill kinetics of S. aureus SA-1199B was examined for 24\u2009h to determine the enhanced antibacterial effect of ciprofloxacin in the presence of EPIs. Ciprofloxacin alone at 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC (8\u2009\u03bcg/ml) and combined with raloxifene or pyrvinium (1/4\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC, i.e., 50\u2009\u03bcM, 0.39\u2009\u03bcM respectively) was used in the assay. As expected, both raloxifene and pyrvinium alone showed no antibacterial effect. Bacterial culture treated with ciprofloxacin alone (8\u2009\u03bcg/ml) displayed killing in the initial 8 h; however, re-growth was observed afterward. A notable increase in the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin was observed after 8 h in the presence of both EPIs when compared to ciprofloxacin alone. The combinations of both raloxifene (Fig.\u00a05E) and pyrvinium (Fig.\u00a05F) almost entirely killed the bacteria in 12 h and 24 h, respectively, and maintained a difference of \u223c 4 log10 CFU below the initial log10 CFU at 0 h. Henceforth, ciprofloxacin-raloxifene and ciprofloxacin-pyrvinium duos could be potential anti-staphylococcal therapy.\n\n## The EPIs prolonged the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of ciprofloxacin.\nAccording to a previous study (22), an antimicrobial agent causes PAE when\u2014immediately after its removal\u2014it brings about a growth delay of at least 0.5 h on a bacterial culture. A log-phase culture of S. aureus SA-1199B was treated with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC of the ciprofloxacin in the presence and absence of raloxifene (50\u2009\u03bcM) and pyrvinium (0.39\u2009\u03bcM) for 2 h. The ciprofloxacin alone displayed a PAE of 1 h. In comparison, the ciprofloxacin\u2013raloxifene (Fig.\u00a05G) and ciprofloxacin\u2013pyrvinium (Fig.\u00a05H) duos increased the PAE of ciprofloxacin by 1.30 h and 1.45 h, respectively. Rationally, to ensure the success of the treatment, an EPI would not always need to be present, as long as the target bacteria retain sensitivity to the antibiotic (12). The prolonged PAE of the combination could aid in determining the optimum dosing frequency of the antibiotic by ensuring the widely-spaced dosing intervals (12).\n\n## The EPIs reduced the resistant mutant development in response to ciprofloxacin.\nBased on the above experiments, raloxifene and pyrvinium were found to be the most active EPIs, which prompted us to study the effect of the compounds on the resistant mutant development in response to the ciprofloxacin. We observed that raloxifene (50\u2009\u03bcM) and pyrvinium (0.39\u2009\u03bcM) decreased the mutation prevention concentration (MPC) of ciprofloxacin by 8- and 16-fold, respectively (Table\u00a03). These results suggest the clinical utility of these combinations to limit the selection of spontaneous resistant mutants.\n\n## The remarkable potency of EPI-ciprofloxacin combination on biofilm disruption.\nThe strong potentiation in ciprofloxacin\u2019s activity displayed by the EPIs prompted us to determine the effect of the EPI\u2013ciprofloxacin duo on the preformed biofilms of S. aureus SA-1199B. In the crystal violet (CV) assay, treatment with EPIs (raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium) alone at sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/4\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC) exhibit negligible impact on the biofilm biomass. Moreover, ciprofloxacin (8\u2009\u03bcg/ml) alone reduced the biofilm biomass by 11% only, while its combination with EPIs resulted in a significant reduction in biofilm biomass. The combination of EPIs with ciprofloxacin reduced the biofilm biomass by 63%, 60%, 63%, 63%, 67%, and 69%, respectively compared to the control (without treatment) (Fig.\u00a06A).\nThe results of the CV assay made us anticipate the effect of the combinations on the cell viability in the mature biofilm. To our anticipation, we performed 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay. Unlike CV, the MTT dye does not stain biological molecules like DNA, proteins, polysaccharides, and others within the bacterial biofilm. The MTT assay measures the metabolic activity of an individual bacterial cell in the biofilm, and only live cells are stained. The bacterial viability is determined by the absorbance at 570\u2009nm, which correlates with the formazan concentrations (23). The EPIs alone at sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/4\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC) did not significantly impact the viable cell population of the preformed biofilm (Fig.\u00a06B). The treatment with ciprofloxacin alone (8\u2009\u03bcg/ml) displayed negligible effect by decreasing the viability of biofilm by 1.05%, while the ciprofloxacin-EPI combination resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability. The combination of ciprofloxacin with the hit EPIs, i.e., raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, nefazodone, chlorprothixene, and pyrvinium, decreased the live cell population in preformed biofilm by around 80%\u201384%, compared to the untreated control (Fig.\u00a06B).\nFurther, we visualized the effect of raloxifene and pyrvinium (best EPIs) in combination with ciprofloxacin on biofilm structure by confocal microscopy supplemented with SYTO9 stain. SYTO9 is a cell-permanent nucleic acid stain and shows a significant fluorescence enhancement when it binds nucleic acids. The regions with SYTO9 staining show green fluorescence and represent live bacterial cells of biofilm. The biofilm of untreated control showed a sturdy structure, and for ciprofloxacin, raloxifene, and pyrvinium alone, a minimal disruption was observed. In contrast, the combination of raloxifene (50\u2009\u03bcM) and pyrvinium (0.39\u2009\u03bcM) with ciprofloxacin (8\u2009\u03bcg/ml) caused significant disintegration of the biofilm (Fig.\u00a06C to H).\n\n## The efficacy of the combination in a murine thigh infection model.\nThe potent in vitro synergistic activity of pyrvinium suggested that this molecule, combined with ciprofloxacin, could be used to treat severe bacterial infections in clinical settings. We determined the in vivo efficacy of ciprofloxacin combined with pyrvinium in a neutropenic murine thigh infection model. The treatment of neither ciprofloxacin (50\u2009mg/kg), ciprofloxacin (10\u2009mg/kg), nor pyrvinium (2\u2009mg/kg) alone exhibit a significant reduction in bacterial counts. In contrast, the ciprofloxacin and pyrvinium combination proved to be very efficient, resulting in \u223c 0.79 log10 and 3.2 log10 reductions in CFU compared to the untreated control at 4 h and 24 h, respectively (Fig.\u00a07).\n\n## DISCUSSION\nEfflux pumps are proteinaceous membrane-integrated transporters in charge of expelling various substances that are otherwise harmful to bacterial survival. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) efflux pumps play a prominent role in drug resistance, pathogenicity, and, as recently described, also in biofilm formation (24). NorA is an MDR efflux pump of the MFS, and expels various hydrophilic fluoroquinolones and dyes in S. aureus. NorA is well established as a model system for studying efflux inhibition in S. aureus. Considering the higher percentage of NorA overproduction in clinical S. aureus strains, this study aimed to investigate potential new EPIs. By limiting the extrusion of antibiotics, EPIs raise their intracellular accumulation at the same dose of the antibiotic. As a consequence, antibiotic-resistant bacteria may become susceptible to that particular antibiotic. Many EPIs have been discovered in past years, but none is clinically approved and achieves optimum plasma concentrations. Thus, we screened FDA-approved drugs for potential NorA EPIs. Our approach was previously validated in a recent study by screening the FDA-approved drug library and identifying nilotinib as the first clinically approved drug that acts as NorA EPI, achieves plasma levels, and displays anti-biofilm activity. However, the in vivo efficacy studies have not been demonstrated hitherto to the best of our knowledge (25).\nThe library of FDA-approved drugs was docked to a NorA homology model to identify initial hits. Reserpine, a well-known NorA inhibitor, was predicted to possess binding energy of \u20134.661\u2009kcal/mol. Since the molecular modeling was performed using homology models, the results will depend on the accuracy of the models used in the study. The templates we used for homology models show high sequence similarity with transporters belonging to MFS. The hits obtained docks at the conserved domain (26), which is the potential substrate, i.e., ciprofloxacin binding site hence suggesting a competitive mode of inhibition. The four FDA-approved drugs, i.e., raloxifene, ezetimibe, propafenone, and nefazodone, having higher binding energies than reserpine, showed equal or greater synergistic activity with ciprofloxacin. Compounds with relatively weak binding energies (chlorprothixene and pyrvinium) also showed strong synergism. Thus, our results suggest a moderate correlation between binding energy and EPI activity.\nAn ideal EPI should lack intrinsic antibacterial activity as bacteria may develop resistance against them (27). The absence of antimicrobial activity at used concentrations makes the compounds in this study advantageous for use as putative EPIs. Compounds with an effect similar to or better than reserpine were tested for synergism. All of the six compounds increased the susceptibility of norA overexpressing S. aureus to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin by many folds in a concentration-dependent manner. It was mentioned earlier that a reduction in the MICs by a minimum of 4-fold with respect to their original values in the presence of a potentiator or an EPI was considered an indication of efflux inhibition (28). Additionally, there was no reduction in MICs of S. aureus K1758, which lacks the functional norA gene. It represents the specificity of these compounds as putative NorA EPIs. The compounds demonstrated synergism with ciprofloxacin and decreasing its MICs below or equal to the clinical resistance breakpoint (1\u2009mg/L) in norA over-expressing as well as some clinical strains of S. aureus. Moreover, raloxifene, ezetimibe, and pyrvinium demonstrated synergism with norfloxacin. They decreased its MIC to the clinical resistance breakpoint (4\u2009mg/L) in norA over-expressing strain, where propafenone, nefazodone, and chlorprothixene demonstrated synergism but could not reduce its MIC to the clinical resistance breakpoint. The bactericidal activity in an agar-plate assay seeded with S. aureus SA-1199B indicates the ability of compounds to potentially reverse NorA efflux pump mediated resistance, facilitating the treatment of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus.\nEtBr accumulation and efflux inhibition assays indicate the efflux pumps\u2019 contribution to resistance (26). The EtBr accumulation and efflux inhibition assay results portray inhibited efflux and increased uptake of EtBr in the presence of all six EPIs. Next, the uptake of norfloxacin was determined in the presence of compounds to test if NorA inhibition could increase its accumulation within the bacterial cell. The natural fluorescence of norfloxacin is directly correlated with its concentration inside the bacterial cell. The results suggested that compounds increased the concentration of norfloxacin inside the S. aureus SA-1199B. These results provided evidence to support the specificity of putative NorA EPIs discovered herein. However, the effect of compounds upon other MDR efflux pumps extruding EtBr and fluoroquinolones cannot be ruled out.\nNone of the compounds except chlorprothixene has earlier been reported as EPIs against S. aureus. Chlorprothixene has been reported to reduce or reverse the resistance of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains to various antibiotics to which these strains were initially resistant (29).\nMany EPIs discovered earlier have several toxicity issues due to their off-target effects. Disruption and depolarization of the bacterial cell membrane may cause efflux inhibition through a nonspecific effect leading to the common identification of false-positive EPIs (12, 30). Also, the capacity of a bacterial cell to synthesize ATP is closely related to the loss of membrane integrity (31). In our study, none of the EPIs, at least at working concentrations, either disturb the membrane function or deplete the bacteria\u2019s total ATP pool. Conclusively, the synergism displayed by the drugs indicates the specificity and true EPI-likeness of the drugs and is not an outcome of any off-target effects.\nIn time-kill kinetics, synergy is defined as a reduction of 2 log10 CFU/mL in combination compared to its most active counterpart (antibiotic here), and must be \u22652 log10 CFU/mL below the starting inoculum (12, 32). We observed 1.9 log10 and 2.3 log10 reductions in CFU for raloxifene and pyrvinium combinations, respectively, compared to ciprofloxacin alone. The combination of pyrvinium and ciprofloxacin exhibited synergy. Therefore, we determined the PAE of ciprofloxacin in combination with raloxifene and pyrvinium. Moreover, raloxifene and pyrvinium boosted the PAE of ciprofloxacin by \u22651.30 h (\u223c150% increment). A similar observation about the enhanced PAE of ciprofloxacin in the presence of capsaicin has been reported previously (26). These results may have significant clinical implications if an EPI causing PAE enhancement is intended to be co-administered with an antibiotic. The basis of the current condition of antimicrobial resistance is the rapid development of bacterial resistance against any antibiotic. Perhaps, bacterial EPIs do not target the essential bacterial processes; they can avoid the resistance development against them. Notably, it has been shown that the non-antibacterial adjuvants that inhibit the resistance mechanism of that antibiotic can lead to diminished resistance development (33). Likewise, we observed a notable decrease in the frequency of spontaneous resistant mutant development in response to ciprofloxacin when combined with raloxifene and pyrvinium. Studies have reported that several similar EPIs, such as capsaicin and boeravinone B, significantly reduced the emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants of S. aureus (26, 34).\nBacterial biofilms are associated with a large number of difficult-to-treat infections. Active efflux pumps have been reported to be upregulated and increase resistance in mature biofilms (35, 36). The inhibition of efflux pumps has also been previously reported to reduce biofilms (37). Moreover, EPIs are previously described to significantly reduce preformed biofilms (24). It makes efflux pumps potentially valuable targets for anti-biofilm measures. Thus, we investigated the effect of EPIs and their combination with ciprofloxacin to eradicate biofilm. The exact contribution of the NorA efflux pump in biofilm formation is not yet fully understood. In our study, EPIs and ciprofloxacin alone did not cause the eradication of biofilms. So, we hypothesized that the effect of EPIs on biofilms might",
