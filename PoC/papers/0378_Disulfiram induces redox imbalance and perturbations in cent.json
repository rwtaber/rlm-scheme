  "full_text": "## Introduction\nTetraethylthiuram disulfide or disulfiram is approved by drug regulatory agencies as an aversion therapy for alcohol use disorder1. Marketed under the brand name Antabuse\u00ae, the medication fosters abstinence by inducing the adverse effects associated with alcohol consumption (e.g., nausea, headache, emesis). The pharmacological action of disulfiram (DSF) is attributed to the inhibition of acetaldehyde metabolism by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the liver2,3. Prior studies have discerned that the active ALDH inhibitors are generated from DSF via its primary metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC)3. The DDTC metabolites are believed to modify one or more cysteine residues in the enzyme to obstruct the conversion of the ethanol-derived acetaldehyde into acetic acid4,5. The resulting accumulation of acetaldehyde in tissues provokes an inflammatory response that manifests the unpleasant symptoms to discourage alcohol use6.\nIn addition to alcohol, DSF has been studied as a dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase antagonist to treat cocaine dependence7. The repurposing of DSF in medicine has also been explored in clinical oncology8\u201310 and infectious diseases11. To this end, there are current efforts to reposition DSF as an antibacterial agent and antibiotic adjuvant11\u201313. Antibacterial profiling of DSF indicates that Gram-positive bacteria have the highest overall degree of susceptibility based on minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements11,14. The lowest MIC values observed among pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria have been with species of Staphylococcus and Bacillus14. In a 2017 article, a thirty-strain panel of Staphylococcus aureus was reported to have a MIC range of 4 to 32\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and a corresponding MIC90 of 16\u00a0\u00b5g/mL13. The panel included methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains harboring one or more resistance genes (e.g., blaZ, mecA, fosB, vanA, tet(M), dfrG) and no cross-resistance between DSF and standard antibiotics was detected.\nAdditionally, two recent studies revealed that DSF augments the bactericidal effects of vancomycin and fosfomycin. In S. aureus isolates with intermediates levels of vancomycin resistance (i.e., VISA), the mechanism of synergy with vancomycin was attributed to a reduction of uncrosslinked muropeptides in the cell wall15. Using BODIPY-labeled vancomycin probe, flow cytometry discerned that VISA Mu50 cells treated with DSF had a lower level of muropeptides to capture vancomycin. The researchers hypothesized that DSF reduced the abundance of uncrosslinked muropeptide targets to counteract the fortification mechanism against vancomycin in VISA. Alternatively, the mechanism of synergy with fosfomycin in S. aureus was ascribed to a depletion of low molecular weight thiols employed as nucleophilic cofactors by the metallothiol transferase fosB to inactivate the epoxide ring of fosfomycin16. The researchers hypothesized that thiol-disulfide exchange reactions with DSF decreased the bioavailability of bacillithiol and cysteine to thwart the ability of fosB to neutralize fosfomycin.\nThe findings of these two studies indicate that DSF has one or more intracellular mechanism(s) of actions in bacteria. As a non-ionizable lipophilic drug, the physiochemical properties of DSF would enable passive diffusion across the plasma membrane of S. aureus. In the cytoplasm, DSF is expected to undergo rapid metabolism via thiol-disulfide exchange with endogenous thiols such as bacillithiol (BSH) and cysteine17. The products generated from these reactions are a mixed disulfide (e.g., BS-DDTC) and DDTC, which can chelate metal ions (e.g., copper, iron, zinc) to perturb cell replication as well18 (Fig.\u00a01). To this end, sodium DDTC is reported to have a MIC of 32\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for the USA300 MRSA strain JE2 compared to 16\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for DSF14. Due to its chemical profile as a pro-oxidant that metabolizes to a second antimicrobial substance (i.e., DDTC), the mechanisms of action of DSF are believed to differ from those of classical antibiotics. In an effort to define the mechanisms, we conducted differential transcriptomic, metabolomic, bioenergetic, and phenotypic growth analyses using the S. aureus JE2 reference strain. The collective studies revealed that DSF impairs central glucose catabolism and induces redox imbalance and metal deprivation to inhibit of the growth of S. aureus.\nFig. 1Chemistry of disulfiram (DSF) and its primary metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC). Thiophilic substances (RSH) cleave DSF to form RS-DDTC conjugates and DDTC that can chelate metals to form M[DDTC]2 and M[DDTC]3 complexes. Pelleted cultures of S. aureus treated with DSF and DDTC exhibit similar discoloration as evidence of M[DDTC]n formation.\n\n## Transcriptomic analysis and bioinformatics\nDifferential RNA expression profiling was performed in order to gain initial insight on the cellular processes modulated by DSF in S. aureus. The sequencing libraries were prepared from purified RNA harvested from 10 mL cultures of plasmid-cured S. aureus JE2 following incubation in LB broth with either 4x MIC of DSF or dimethylsulfoxide (vehicle) for one-hour. The 4x MIC dose was chosen for the analysis because it was bacteriostatic to the strain, which we believed would be the optimal treatment to detect for transcriptomic changes affecting cell replication. After the libraries were sequenced, the reads were aligned to the S. aureus JE2 genome (txid 451515), and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Bioconductor/R package DESeq2. The DEGs were selected on the basis of statistical significance (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05), annotated, and mapped to biological pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database19. The results summarized in Table\u00a01 depicts the number of DEGs associated with key KEGG pathways with a log2 fold change (log2FC) score of 1.5 or greater. The mapping analysis revealed that DSF increased the transcription of genes governing the biosynthesis of pantothenate, coenzyme A (CoASH), thiamine, menaquinone, staphyloferrin A/B (siderophores), and staphylopine (metallophore). Moreover, DSF appeared to stimulate an antioxidant response, the sulfur relay system, DNA repair, \u03b1-ketoglutarate and glutamate production, and the import of arginine, cysteine/cystine, citrate, and metal ions. The analysis further indicated that DSF decelerates glycolysis, citric acid cycle activity, oxidative phosphorylation, RNA synthesis, protein translation, and glycan production.\nTable 1KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes with \u2265\u20091.5 log2FC increase (+) or decrease (-) in RNA expression.\nTo assess whether these transcriptomic changes were specific to the actions of DSF, we conducted expression profile overlap analysis of data obtained from JE2 cultures treated with its primary metabolite DDTC at 4x MIC (Fig.\u00a01). The comparison revealed that DSF and DDTC had over sixty DEGs with a log2FC score of 1.5 or higher in common. The up-regulated scorers included genes governing copper export (copA), iron import (fepC), and redox balance (trxB). The down-regulated scorers included regulators of ATP biosynthesis (atp), nitrate and nitrite metabolism (nar, nir), and urease import (pyrP). In the final analysis, we concluded that transcriptomic changes were more significant for DSF than DDTC. Accordingly, the following sections presented in the context of KEGG pathways will focus on the biological effects that we believe are the most pertinent to the mechanisms of antibacterial action for DSF.\n\n## Glucose catabolism\nThe transcriptomic data provided extensive evidence that S. aureus down-regulates central glucose catabolism in response to DSF stress (Fig.\u00a02a). In the glycolysis pathway, seven canonical genes governing the breakdown of glucose-6\u2019P to pyruvate had reduced transcript levels that corresponded to a mean log2FC score of \u2013 1.7 (Table 1.1\u00a0S). The DEG analysis further indicated that DSF decelerates glucose uptake by modulating the phosphotransferase system genes glcA (log2FC -1.3) and glcC (\u2013 1.7). In contrast, the pentose phosphate pathway appeared to be up-regulated with the notable induction of the gene for glucose-6\u2019P dehydrogenase (zwf). Consistent with these results, the metabolomic data of cell lysates revealed that DSF elevates NADPH (+\u20090.7, p 0.03) and lowers glucose (\u2013 0.4, p 0.04) levels. Moreover, DSF increased NAD (+\u20091.5, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and decreased pyruvate (\u2013 0.9, p 0.01) levels as additional evidence of reduced glycolytic activity (Fig.\u00a03a).\nFig. 2Transcriptional effects of DSF on genes governing glycolysis, pantothenate/CoASH biosynthesis, and associated pathways in S. aureus. (a) Schematic representation of up-regulated (red) and down-regulated (blue) genes. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DSF up-regulates the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoASH) and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Conversely, DSF down-regulated the genes governing glycolysis and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoASAc) formation. (b) Mass spectroscopy revealed that DSF and CoASH react to form the mix disulfide CoAS-DDTC at physiological pH.\nFig. 3Changes in the metabolome of S. aureus induced by DSF and DDTC. (a) Differential analysis of S. aureus JE2 lysates revealed that DSF and DDTC alters the cellular levels of metabolites involved in energy metabolism (e.g., NADH) and redox homeostasis (e.g., BSH). (b) HPLC-based metabolomics profiling indicates that DSF and DDTC alters the procurement or utilization of amino acids in S. aureus. Values represent the log2FC calculated from the vehicle control (*p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05).\nDue to its thiol-reactive property, we hypothesized that DSF perturbs glycolysis by depleting cellular CoASH. To establish whether DSF decreased the intracellular pool of CoASH, we performed HPLC-based thiol metabolomics using the thiol-reactive fluorescent probe monobromobimane20. Indeed, differential analysis of the HPLC data revealed that S. aureus JE2 had a 1.1-fold reduction of CoASH following one-hour treatment with DSF. Mass spectroscopy was further employed to corroborate that CoASH reacts with DSF to form the mix disulfide CoAS-DDTC (Fig.\u00a02b). At pH 7.4, rapid thiol-disulfide exchange was observed however, the CoAS-DDTC adduct also proved to be unstable to S. aureus lysates which we attribute to its reaction with cellular thiols such as BSH and cysteine. Lastly, the transcriptomic data revealed that DSF induced the genes panB (+\u20092.0), panE (+\u20091.8), coaA (+\u20091.8), and coaBC (+\u20091.3) governing pantothenate/CoASH biosynthesis as added evidence of a decrease in CoASH.\nThe reduction in glycolytic activity and/or CoASH also appeared to attenuate the production of acetyl coenzyme A (CoASAc) from pyruvate and acetate (Fig.\u00a02). Moreover, the transcriptomic changes indicated that the use of pyruvate in other transformations was influenced by the direct or indirect actions of DSF. The pathway analysis revealed that ten genes encoding for enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism were down-regulated by DSF. Among them were the genes for L-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh1 \u2013 3.7), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (vraB \u2212\u20093.6), pyruvate carboxylase (pyc \u2212\u20092.0), and pyruvate kinase (pyk \u2212\u20091.5). Curiously, the gene for D-lactate dehydrogenase (ddh) was markedly up-regulated by both DSF (+\u20096.4) and DDTC (+\u20094.2). We speculate the induction was a stress response to normalize the intracellular NAD: NADH ratio using the D-lactate conversion as an electron sink21. Alternatively, the up-regulation of ddh may be due to direct inhibition of the enzyme by DSF and/or DDTC.\nCitric acid cycle activity also appeared to be impacted by the perturbed levels of pyruvate, CoASAc, and NADH (Fig.\u00a04a). The mapping of DEGs in the KEGG database showed that DSF reduced the transcription of seven canonical genes governing the cycle (Fig.\u00a02a) and up-regulated those for citrate synthase (gltA\u2009+\u20091.0) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd\u2009+\u20091.1). The metabolomic data further revealed that the cellular levels of citric acid cycle intermediates malate (+\u20090.8, p 0.006) and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (+\u20092.4, p 0.001) were elevated in DSF-treated cultures. Likewise, DDTC conferred comparable increases in malate (+\u20090.8, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (+\u20092.8, p 0.003). Additionally, both DSF and DDTC decreased the cellular level of citrate (\u2013 0.5, p 0.02), which was partly attributed to its increased use for glutamate, ornithine, and staphyloferrin biosynthesis (Fig.\u00a04a).\nFig. 4Transcriptional effects of DSF on genes governing the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and associated pathways. (a) Schematic representation of up-regulated (red) and down-regulated (blue) genes. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that DSF induces arginine catabolism and staphyloferrin biosynthesis from citrate, glutamate, and ornithine. The transcriptomic data further indicated that DSF decelerates citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation activity. (b) Results of the bioenergetic studies in S. aureus JE2 depicted as percent baseline of mean vehicle control values. The graphs show that DDTC is a more effective inhibitor of the OCR (left) and ECAR (middle) in S. aureus than DSF or the uncoupler standard CCCP. Moreover, DSF and DDTC reduced the basal cell membrane potential in S. aureus but to a lesser degree compared to CCCP (right).\n\n## Oxidative phosphorylation\nOur collective studies indicate that DSF decelerates ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation via the electron transport chain. In S. aureus, the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation are orchestrated by oxygen reductases (Qox, Cyd), NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2), menaquinones, electron donors (e.g., NADH, pyruvate, L-lactate, malate, succinate) and ATP synthases22. The transcriptomic data provided multiple clues that DSF curtails the use of NADH (+\u20091.0, p 0.03) as an electron donor in the electron transport chain. Nine genes assigned to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway had reduced transcript levels including qoxA (-2.0), ndh2 (\u2013 1.7), and atpACDEFGH (\u2013 2.6 to \u2013 3.3). We also found that DDTC down-regulated the same seven atp genes encoding for ATP synthase subunits (Table 2.1\u00a0S). In order to confirm the impact of these transcriptomic changes on oxidative phosphorylation, we performed differential bioenergetic and ATP metabolomic studies using S. aureus JE2.\nThe Seahorse XFe extracellular flux analyzer was employed to detect for alterations in cellular respiration based on oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates (i.e., OCR, ECAR)23. Bacteriostatic treatments of DSF and DDTC were compared to the conventional uncoupler standard CCCP at 1x MIC in Seahorse XF media. The results depicted in Fig.\u00a04b (left) shows that DSF and CCCP decreases the OCR by 15\u201325% while DDTC conferred up to 84% inhibition within the first hour of treatment. The ECAR data mirrored these findings as further confirmation of reduced oxidative phosphorylation activity (Fig.\u00a04b, middle). We also examined the influence of DSF and DDTC on the cell membrane potential using S. aureus JE2 labeled with DiOC2(3). The cationic probe emits red fluorescence by interacting with negatively charged membranes and shifts to green when depolarization occurs, decreasing the emission ratio24. The data revealed that both treatments decreased the basal membrane potential by 15 to 20% within 15\u00a0min of treatment compared to 50% for CCCP (Fig.\u00a04b, right).\nWhile it was evident from these studies that DSF decelerates cellular respiration, the HPLC analysis of bacterial lysates did not reveal a notable change in intracellular ATP (\u2013 0.07, p 0.6) at the one-hour timepoint. This outcome aligns with our prior observation that luciferase-detected ATP levels are comparable in untreated S. aureus after one hour15. In contrast, the HPLC analysis showed treatment with DDTC conferred a significant reduction in intracellular ATP (\u2013 0.6, p 0.007). Moreover, increased levels of CoASH (+\u20091.0, p 0.02), NADH (+\u20091.1, p 0.02) and NADPH (+\u20090.5, p 0.09) were observed. With DDTC also proving to be more potent antagonist of the OCR, we concluded that the active inhibitor of the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation is DDTC in DSF-treated S. aureus. We further hypothesize that the mechanism of action involves the chelation of the metal ions (e.g., iron) that participate in the redox chemistry of the electron transport chain.\n\n## Nucleotide metabolism\nThe KEGG database revealed that DSF induces S. aureus to down-regulate the transcription of genes in the PurR and PyrR regulons governing purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, respectively (Table 4.2\u00a0S). Transcription of the pyrimidine transporter (nupC \u2212\u20092.0) and uracil permease (pyrP \u2212\u20092.3) genes were likewise attenuated indicating that DSF slows nucleobase scavenging. In contrast, the genes encoding purine nucleosidase (+\u20092.4) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase deoD (+\u20094.3) were up-regulated by DSF which would in part explain the elevation of adenosine (+\u20091.6, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Other notable scorers associated with GDP/GTP metabolism were relQ (+\u20091.4) and relP (\u2013 2.4) which prior studies revealed are part of the VraRS cell wall stress regulon in S. aureus and encode for small alarmone synthetases of (p)ppGpp that catalyze a stringent response25.\n\n## Genetic information processing\nThe analysis of DEGs revealed that DSF decelerates protein translation in S. aureus (Table\u00a08\u00a0S). Reduced mRNA transcription activity was evident by the down-regulation of genes governing UTP synthesis (pyrABCFH), uracil import (pyrP), and the expression of RNA polymerase subunits (rpo). Moreover, the transcription of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes (n\u2009=\u200928) was reduced by an average log2FC score of -1.7 (Table 8.5\u00a0S). An even larger contingent of genes (n\u2009=\u200957) encoding for the 50\u00a0S (rpm, rpl), 30\u00a0S (rps), 23\u00a0S (rrl), and 16\u00a0S (rrs) ribosomal subunits were down-regulated as similarly observed in S. aureus undergoing a stringent response (Table 8.6\u00a0S)26. Conversely, DSF appeared to stimulate the genes involved in DNA repair including those encoding for DNA polymerase V (+\u20092.0), recombinase recT (+\u20092.5), exonuclease recJ (+\u20091.4) and DNA polymerase IV (+\u20093.4)27. However, neither positive (recA \u2212\u20090.6) nor negative (lexA \u2212\u20091.3) regulators of the SOS response28 were found to be induced by DSF.\n\n## Glycan metabolism\nThe transcriptomic profile indicates that DSF has moderate influences on peptidoglycan biosynthesis and metabolism (Table\u00a06\u00a0S). The modulations observed for pbp4 (+\u20091.1), pbp1 (\u2013 0.6), murA (-0.7), sgtB (\u2013 1.5), mecA (\u2013 1.9), and uppS (\u2013 2.0) suggests that DSF slows muropeptide biosynthesis and promotes crosslink formation29 (Fig.\u00a05). The reduced transcription of vraS (\u2013 1.1) further inferred that DSF does not induce cell wall damage20. Other notable scorers associated with the cell wall were the genes for transglycosylase isaA (\u2013 2.2), hydrolase lytN (+\u20092.4), Ala racemase alr2 (+\u20093.0) and protein vraC (\u2013 4.0). Interestingly, DDTC also reduced the transcription of vraC (\u2013 2.9) whose deletion in S. aureus was shown to decrease cell wall thickness and increase VISA susceptibility to vancomycin30. The down-regulation of vraC by DSF/DDTC may thereby be associated with the mechanism of synergism with vancomycin in VISA Mu5015.\nFig. 5Transcriptional effects of DSF on genes governing cell wall, menaquinone, and phenylalanine biosynthesis in S. aureus. Schematic representation of up-regulated (red) and down-regulated (blue) genes. The KEGG pathway analysis indicates that DSF increases menaquinone biosynthesis and attenuates peptidoglycan and phenylalanine synthesis.\n\n## Amino acid metabolism\nThe transcriptomic and HPLC studies revealed that DSF induces significant changes in the amino acid metabolome of S. aureus (Fig.\u00a03b). The enrichment analysis indicated that genes governing the uptake or biosynthesis of glycine (opuCC\u2009+\u20092.5), alanine (alsT\u2009+\u20091.5), glutamate (gltD\u2009+\u20091.3)31, cystine/cysteine (tcyP\u2009+\u20093.4)32, and lysine (lysA\u2009+\u20092.6) were induced by DSF. Consistent with these results, the intracellular levels of glycine (+\u20093.9, p 0.002), alanine (+\u20090.7, p 0.2), glutamate (+\u20090.7, p 0.04), and lysine (+\u20090.7, p 0.03) were higher in DSF-treated bacteria. However, the HPLC analysis showed significant depletion of cysteine (-8.6, p 0.003) which was attributed to elevations in thiol buffering and CoASH biosynthesis. The analysis also revealed a significant decrease in cellular valine (\u2013 1.3, p 0.04) which we attributed to an increase in use of its chemical precursor (i.e., 2-oxoisovalerate) for pantothenate/CoASH production33. Specifically, DSF up-regulated the gene panB (+\u20092.0) encoding for 2-oxoisovalerate hydroxymethyltransferase that suggested less of the precursor was available for valine biosynthesis.\nSimilarly, the depletion of phenylalanine (\u2013 1.8, p 0.03) was linked to the elevated use of its precursor (i.e., chorismate) to synthesize menaquinone for the respiratory chain34 (Fig.\u00a05). This correlated to the transcriptional changes for the genes encoding for isochorismate synthase (menF\u2009+\u20091.7) and chorismate mutase (aroA2 \u2013 1.3). We further observed that DSF induced arginine catabolism as a probable compensatory response to deficient ATP production from cellular respiration. Prior studies found that S. aureus can use the arginine deiminase pathway to generate ATP under glucose-deficient and anaerobic conditions35. The transcriptomic data revealed that DSF induces the arginine-ornithine antiporter gene (arcD\u2009+\u20093.2) which we in part attributed to the elevation in arginine (+\u20091.5, p 0.05). Moreover, the ornithine carbamoyl transferase (arcB\u2009+\u20091.5) and carbamate kinase (arcC\u2009+\u20092.3) genes were up-regulated as evidence for the increased production of ATP from arginine (Fig.\u00a04a).\n\n## Thiamine biosynthesis\nThe enrichment analysis revealed that thiamine biosynthesis is induced by DSF in S. aureus. Serving as the bioactive form in bacteria, thiamine pyrophosphate functions as a coenzyme in the production of pantothenate/CoASH and CoASAc36. Its essential role in the formation of CoASH led us to speculate that DSF would elevate thiamine pyrophosphate biosynthesis. Indeed, the HPLC analysis of lysates from DSF-treated JE2 had a higher level of thiamine pyrophosphate (+\u20090.6, p 0.004) compared to vehicle-treated control (Fig.\u00a04a). Consistent with these findings, the transcriptomic data revealed multiple genes associated with thiamine biosynthesis were up-regulated including thilD (+\u20094.0), thiE (+\u20092.3), and iscS (+\u20092.3). We further observed that the JE2 \u0394thiE mutant with defective thiamine phosphate production was more sensitive than the wildtype JE2 strain to DSF but not DDTC.\nFig. 6Effects of DSF and DDTC on the growth of wildtype (wt) JE2 in comparison with transposon mutants. (a) Growth phenotype analysis indicates that transposon mutants with defects in citrate (\u0394gltA), thiamine phosphate (\u0394thiE), and bacillithiol (\u0394bshA) production were more susceptible to DSF while the staphyloferrin B-deficient mutant JE2 \u0394sbnC was more sensitive to DDTC. (b) Growth curve of untreated versus DSF-treated (4x MIC*) wt JE2 and \u0394bshA mutant treated. (c) Differential analysis using wt JE2 labeled with the oxidant-sensitive H2DCFDA probe indicates that DSF and H2O2 elicit oxidative stress while 1x MIC DDTC reduced the cellular oxidation state.\n\n## Metal acquisition\nAs depicted in Fig.\u00a01, thiol-mediated metabolism of DSF and RS-DDTC releases DDTC that can chelate divalent (e.g., Mg2+, Cu2+, Zn2+) and trivalent (e.g., Fe3+) metals in the cell. Upon cleavage, DDTC is believed to sequester metals in M[DDTC]n complexes and stimulate S. aureus to acquire metals from the environment. Indeed, DSF was found to induce metal uptake and siderophore/metallophore biosynthesis. Six genes encoding for ABC transporters of molybdenum (modBC), cobalt (cbiO1), nickel (cnzC), and zinc (znuB) were up-regulated by DSF. A similar effect was observed for those encoding the iron permeases fepC (+\u20093.7), sirA (+\u20092.2), fhuB (+\u20091.9), sstB (+\u20091.8), and htsB (+\u20091.4). Conversely, the data indicated that DSF provokes S. aureus to decrease its cytoplasmic levels of magnesium (cobI \u2212\u20092.7) and copper (copA\u2009+\u20092.8). A similar effect was also observed for DDTC (cobI \u2212\u20091.2, copA\u2009+\u20092.9). At this time, we attribute the modulations of cobI and copA to the synergism between DDTC and these metals. Prior research has shown that magnesium and copper decrease the MIC of DDTC against S. aureus18. We hypothesize that the formation of Mg[DDTC]2 and Cu[DDTC]2 triggers the transcriptional down-regulation of magnesium import and up-regulation of copper export to reduce exposure to the complexes.\nSurprisingly, the overall induction of metal acquisition for DDTC was lower than DSF. The top scorers for DDTC were fepC (+\u20091.5), sirA (+\u20091.5), and cbiO1 (+\u20091.0). In addition, DDTC did not stimulate staphyloferrin or staphylopine production unlike DSF. Five sbn genes governing the secretion and biosynthesis of staphyloferrin B from L-serine, L-glutamate, and citrate37 were only up-regulated by DSF. Likewise, DSF induced the genes for staphyloferrin A synthase (sbnF\u2009+\u20091.5) and the staphylopine-mediated acquisition of metals (i.e., cntBDFKL)38. Although enrichment of the siderophore-associated genes was not observed with DDTC, phenotypic growth analysis revealed that the JE2 \u0394sbnC mutant with defective staphyloferrin B production was more sensitive to DDTC than DSF (Fig.\u00a06).\n\n## Nitrogen and sulfur metabolism\nThe pathway analysis revealed that the genes for respiratory nitrate (i.e., narHGJ) and nitrite reductases (i.e., nirBD) were down-regulated by DSF (-1.8 to -2.6) and DDTC (\u2013 2.5 to \u2013 4.3). Conversely, DSF induced sulfur metabolism and relay as evident by the enrichment of iscS, moaD, and mnmA (\u2265\u20092-fold). The thioredoxin reductase genes trxA (+\u20091.3) and trxB (+\u20092.0) were also induced by DSF which was observed prior in S. aureus treated with diamide39. Diamide and DSF are chemically similar in their ability to catalyze disulfide formation between neighboring cysteine residues in proteins40,41. Prior studies revealed that oxidized cysteine residues in S. aureus are repaired by bacilliredoxin and BSH in concert with BS-SB reductase and a reducing cofactor (e.g., NADPH)42,43. Due to its thiol-reactive nature, we speculated that the bioavailability of BSH to participate in protein repair would be depleted by DSF. The HPLC analysis indeed showed that DSF decreases the intracellular level of reduced BSH (-2.3, p 0.004). The transcriptomic data further revealed that BSH biosynthesis was induced by DSF. As the primary antioxidant thiol in S. aureus, BSH is synthesized in a three-reaction sequence from UDP-GlcNAc and malate44. The data indicated that DSF up-regulated the gene bshC (+\u20092.6) encoding for the final enzyme (i.e., cysteine ligase) in the biosynthetic pathway. Additionally, differential growth analysis showed the BSH-deficient JE2 \u0394bshA mutant45 was more susceptible to DSF than the wildtype JE2 strain (Fig.\u00a06a and b).\n\n## Redox regulation\nThe transcriptomic data revealed that DSF provokes oxidative stress (i.e., redox imbalance) in S. aureus. Table 9.1S shows DSF induced the genes for prominent antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (sodA\u2009+\u20091.2), catalase (katA\u2009+\u20092.6), and glutathione peroxidase (gpxA2\u2009+\u20092.1). In addition, DSF up-regulated the gene cymR (+\u20091.8) encoding for a Rrf2-type transcriptional regulator that uses a cysteine redox sensor to detect for oxidative stress46. Altogether with the induction of cstR (+\u20094.2), ctsR (+\u20092.2), mhqR (+\u20092.2), perR (+\u20090.9), and hrcA (+\u20090.9), we concluded that DSF stimulates a global response to the redox stress43,47. To discern whether the cellular oxidation state is indeed altered by DSF, we treated S. aureus JE2 cells labeled with the oxidant-sensing probe 2\u2019,7\u2019-dicholorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate (H2DCFDA)48. The results depicted in Fig.\u00a06c shows DSF and hydrogen peroxide (positive control) raised the fluorescence signal as indicator of an increase in oxidative stress. Conversely, treatment with 1x MIC DDTC reduced the cellular oxidation state which was attributed in part to the chelating, reductant, and antioxidant properties of DDTC49. This study further revealed that DDTC impairs oxidative phosphorylation activity which would curtail the production of superoxide and other reactive oxygen species to oxidize the probe into the fluorescent analyte.\n\n## Discussion\nPrior research has revealed that the antimicrobial spectrum of DSF encompasses a diverse range of bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, and helminths11. As a promiscuous thiol-reactive drug, the mechanisms of action and drug targets of DSF would be expected to differ between organism types. For example, the mechanism of anthelmintic action in Schistosoma mansoni (blood fluke) and Trichuris muris (whipworm) was attributed to the inhibition of phenol oxidase-mediated eggshell formation50,51. In Giardia and Cryptosporidium sp., triosephosphate isomerase52, carbamate kinase53, and inosine 5\u2019-monophosphate dehydrogenase54 were evaluated as antiprotozoal drug targets. In SARS-CoV-2, DSF inhibited papain-like cysteine proteases involved in viral replication55 while in Pythium insidiosum, ALDH and urease were reported as candidate drug targets56. Past mechanism-related research in bacteria has mainly focused on the role of DSF to sensitize or resensitize to antibiotics. Such studies have been described for vancomycin15, fosfomycin16, carbapenems57,58, colistin58, and tetracycline59. To our knowledge, this research represents the first comprehensive exploration on the mechanisms of antimicrobial action of DSF in bacteria.\nThe results of the study indicate that DSF is an unorthodox antibacterial drug which we attribute to its unique chemical properties. Specifically, DSF functions as a catalysis of thiol-disulfide exchange reactions that generate a chelating byproduct (i.e., DDTC) which can further suppress bacterial growth. In this investigation, the use of differe",
