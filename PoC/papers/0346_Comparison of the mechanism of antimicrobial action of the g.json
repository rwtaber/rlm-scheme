  "abstract": "While highly effective at killing Gram-positive bacteria, auranofin lacks significant activity against Gram-negative species for reasons that largely remain unclear. Here, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the low susceptibility of the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli to auranofin when compared to the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. The proteome response of E. coli exposed to auranofin suggests a combination of inactivation of thiol-containing enzymes and the induction of systemic oxidative stress. Susceptibility tests in E. coli mutants lacking proteins upregulated upon auranofin treatment suggested that none of them are directly involved in E. coli's high tolerance to auranofin. E. coli cells lacking the efflux pump component TolC were more sensitive to auranofin treatment, but not to an extent that would fully explain the observed difference in susceptibility of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. We thus tested whether E. coli's thioredoxin reductase (TrxB) is inherently less sensitive to auranofin than TrxB from B. subtilis, which was not the case. However, E. coli strains lacking the low-molecular-weight thiol glutathione, but not glutathione reductase, showed a high susceptibility to auranofin. Bacterial cells expressing the genetically encoded redox probe roGFP2 allowed us to observe the oxidation of cellular protein thiols in situ. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that auranofin leads to a global disturbance in the cellular thiol redox homeostasis in bacteria, but Gram-negative bacteria are inherently more resistant due to the presence of drug export systems and high cellular concentrations of glutathione.IMPORTANCEAuranofin is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, it has also high antibacterial activity, in particular against Gram-positive organisms. In the current antibiotics crisis, this would make it an ideal candidate for drug repurposing. However, its much lower activity against Gram-negative organisms prevents its broad-spectrum application. Here we show that, on the level of the presumed target, there is no difference in susceptibility between Gram-negative and Gram-positive species: thioredoxin reductases from both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are equally inhibited by auranofin. In both species, auranofin treatment leads to oxidative protein modification on a systemic level, as monitored by proteomics and the genetically encoded redox probe roGFP2. The single largest contributor to E. coli's relative resistance to auranofin seems to be the low-molecular-weight thiol glutathione, which is absent in B. subtilis and other Gram-positive species.",

  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nThe evolutionary emergence and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is an ongoing and rising public health concern, as infections caused by these pathogens claim the lives of nearly 700,000 people across the globe each year (1). This number is expected to increase dramatically if no urgent actions are taken. Unfortunately, the slow progress in the discovery and development of new antibiotic classes has led to a limited availability of novel antimicrobial compounds for clinical use and, thus, made the effective treatment of many bacterial infections more challenging (2). Accordingly, there is an urgent medical need to identify new and improved antibacterial agents with unprecedented modes of action to tackle the global antibiotic resistance crisis (3). Since conventional de novo drug discovery and development are lengthy, expensive, and complex, repurposing approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy by re-evaluating their biological targets and mechanisms of action is considered a key strategy to overcome these issues (4). Although using known drugs for indications they were not originally developed for is far from new, it has gained considerable attention in the last decade, with about one-third of new US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals being for repurposed drugs (5).\nThe use of metals, such as silver, gold, and platinum, and compounds based on these and other metals, in treating diseases dates to ancient times (6), but their full potential as therapeutic drugs has not been realized yet. With the discovery of the platinum-based compound cisplatin as an anticancer agent in the 20th century, metallodrugs have experienced an impressive renaissance of interest in modern medicine, leading to the development of several other metal complexes with antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties over the last decades (7).\nAuranofin, a gold(I)-containing triethyl phosphine, was initially approved by the FDA in 1985 as an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and was the first orally active gold compound proven to slow the progression of the disease by inhibiting antibody-mediated cellular toxicity and stimulating cell-mediated immunity (8, 9). Auranofin\u2019s primary mode of action in humans is thought to be the inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (10). Auranofin\u2019s exceptionally high affinity toward TrxR is due to the reactivity of its thiol ligand with thiol groups, especially the selenol group of the selenocysteine present in eukaryotic TrxR (11\u201314). TrxR was shown to be highly expressed in the inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and it is assumed to be involved in disease activity and suppression of apoptosis in the affected tissue (15, 16). TrxR is a central component of the antioxidant thioredoxin (Trx) system. It catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the redox protein thioredoxin (Trx), which is crucial in maintaining the cellular environment in a reduced state and protecting the cells against damage from oxidative stress (17, 18).\nMore recent studies also indicate that TrxR is highly abundant in various types of human cancer cells and, thus, represents a promising therapeutic target for anticancer drug development. Gold-induced inactivation of mammalian TrxR by auranofin leads to severe oxidative stress due to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of apoptotic signaling pathways, ultimately triggering cancer cell death (19, 20).\nBesides these effects in eukaryotes, auranofin and related gold-based compounds have also shown promising activity against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms at a clinically achievable nanomolar range. In a study by Debnath et al., auranofin was highly efficacious against the intestinal parasite Entamoeba histolytica, providing the first evidence that this gold drug could be repurposed as a novel antimicrobial agent (21). Indeed, more recent studies have reported remarkable bactericidal effects of auranofin against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, certain Bacillus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (22\u201325). As a result, auranofin has become the reference compound for developing new, structurally related organogold antimicrobial drugs with lower toxicity, a broader spectrum of activity, and greater efficacy (26).\nAlthough progress has been made in understanding the underlying mechanistical aspects of auranofin\u2019s antimicrobial activity, the precise mechanisms of its action and the respective biological targets in bacteria are still largely unknown.\nRecent studies point toward a complex multitarget mechanism of auranofin\u2019s action in prokaryotic organisms that involves inhibition of several biosynthetic pathways, including protein, DNA, and cell wall synthesis (27), and disruption of thiol-redox homeostasis (22, 28). Among these possible modes of action, inhibition of thiol-containing redox enzymes essential for maintaining intracellular thiol-redox balance is widely considered the primary mechanism through which auranofin exerts its cytotoxic effects on bacteria (22). A growing number of studies demonstrate a strong inhibitory effect on bacterial thioredoxin reductase (TrxB). For instance, auranofin has been shown to effectively inhibit TrxB of S. aureus, M. tuberculosis, and H. pylori in vitro, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Notably, the growth of these organisms was also strongly impaired in the presence of auranofin (22, 29).\nWhile auranofin is highly effective against Gram-positive bacteria, it is much less active against Gram-negative bacteria, exhibiting a markedly higher minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (22). However, the reasons for the limited susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to auranofin are still unknown.\nIn this work, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased tolerance of Gram-negative bacteria to auranofin. We utilized E. coli and B. subtilis as representative species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively, to systematically uncover the mode of auranofin\u2019s action by testing its effect on TrxB activity and growth of these organisms. We studied the proteomic response of E. coli exposed to auranofin stress to uncover potential defense mechanisms that could mediate their increased resistance to auranofin. We also focused on factors that differ between Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, such as TolC, the outer membrane factor of an efflux pump in E. coli. Cells lacking TolC were more susceptible to auranofin, however not to an extent that would make TolC-dependent drug efflux the only factor explaining E. coli\u2019s relative resistance to auranofin. A systematic evaluation of mutants lacking components of the thioredoxin system and the glutathione-dependent antioxidant system suggests that the presence of a high concentration of the low-molecular-weight thiol glutathione is a major factor contributing to E. coli\u2019s tolerance. This is in line with cytoplasmic thiol oxidation caused by auranofin in vivo, which we observed using E. coli and B. subtilis cells expressing the well-known redox probe roGFP2. Overall, our data suggest that auranofin\u2019s mode of action against Gram-negative species does not significantly differ from that against Gram-positive species. Instead, it seems that the higher resistance of E. coli is caused in part by a combination of drug efflux and, more importantly, the presence of high concentrations of the low-molecular-weight thiol glutathione, which attenuate the cytotoxic effects of auranofin.\n\n## Determination of the MIC of auranofin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria\nAuranofin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) was tested for bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii DSM 30007, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 50071, Bacillus subtilis 168, Staphylococcus aureus DSM 20231, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 (MRSA), E. coli DSM 30083, E. coli BW25113, and E. coli BW25113-derived mutant strains from the KEIO collection (30) listed in Table 1. E. coli DSM 30083, A. baumannii, S. aureus, and B. subtilis were grown in Mueller Hinton broth, and P. aeruginosa in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton II. MIC assays with these strains were performed in a microdilution assay in 200 \u00b5L medium according to CLSI guidelines, as described by Albada et al. (31). For MIC assays with E. coli BW25113 and the derived mutant strains from the KEIO collection, cells inoculated to a density of 5 \u00d7 105 cells/mL were grown at 37\u00b0C in reaction tubes containing 5 mL MOPS Minimal Medium (Teknova) (32), a medium which contains MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid), supplemented with 10 \u00b5M thiamine and the respective concentrations of auranofin overnight.\nAuranofin was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Serial dilutions of this stock solution were prepared in the various culture media with the Tecan Freedom Evo 75 liquid handling workstation (Tecan, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland) for tests according to CLSI guidelines. They typically covered a range from 512 to 0.5 \u00b5g/mL (512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL). In E. coli BW25113 and the E. coli BW25113-derived mutants, a range of 256\u20134 \u00b5g/mL (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, and 4 \u00b5g/mL) was tested; these dilutions were prepared manually. Equivalent volumes of DMSO were used as vehicle controls but had no effect on bacterial growth overnight.\nAll bacterial strains were grown until the exponential growth phase was reached. At an OD600 of 0.4\u20130.5, 5 \u00d7 105 cells/mL of the exponentially growing cultures were used to inoculate the previously prepared auranofin dilutions in the same growth medium. After 16\u201318 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, bacterial growth at various auranofin concentrations was assessed visually and photometrically by measuring the cultures\u2019 OD at 600 nm. The lowest auranofin concentration with no visually perceptible growth was recorded as MIC.\n\n## Construction of plasmids encoding bacterial TrxB\nPlasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Plasmid construction followed standard procedures. The correctness of all newly constructed plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing.\nFor the expression and subsequent purification of E. coli MG1655 and B. subtilis 168 TrxB, the respective trxB genes were fused to an N-terminal SUMO tag and cloned into pET22b(+) vectors (35). The SUMO tag contains a SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) protein sequence, which enhances expression and solubility of the fusion protein, a His6 tag, which allows for purification of the fusion protein using Ni\u2013NTA chromatography, and an Ulp1 protease cleavage site (35).\nThe SUMO tag sequence was amplified from the pE-SUMO plasmid using the forward primer AI003_SUMO_for carrying a NdeI restriction site and AI004_SUMO_rev or MM004_SUMO_rev, containing an overhang complementary to the N-terminal portion of the E. coli or B. subtilis trxB sequence, respectively (Table 2). In a second PCR, the genes encoding TrxB were amplified from genomic DNA of E. coli MG1655 and B. subtilis 168 using the following primers: AI001_for and AI002_rev, and MM001_for and MM002_rev for E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively. The resulting PCR fragments contained an overhang sequence to the SUMO tag at the 5\u2032 end and an XhoI restriction site at the 3\u2032 end. Finally, an overlap PCR was performed using the primers AI003_SUMO_for and AI002_rev (for E. coli TrxB) or MM002_rev (for B. subtilis TrxB) to fuse the SUMO tag sequence to the N-terminus of the respective trxB gene. The obtained PCR product (i.e., NdeI-SUMO-TrxB-XhoI) was then restricted with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into a pET22b(+) vector, resulting in pAI (E. coli MG1655 trxB) and pMM (B. subtilis 168 trxB). E. coli DH5\u03b1 and E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were then transformed with the plasmids for plasmid maintenance and heterologous protein expression, respectively.\n\n## Heterologous protein expression\nFor heterologous protein expression, a single colony of E. coli BL21 (DE3) carrying pAI or pMM was used to inoculate 50 mL LB broth containing 200 \u00b5g/L ampicillin, and the cells were grown overnight at 37\u00b0C and 125 rpm. The overnight culture was then used to inoculate 5 L of LB medium, supplemented with ampicillin. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 125 rpm until an OD600 of 0.5\u20130.6 was reached. Subsequently, protein expression was induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-\u00df-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to the cell culture. After overnight incubation at 20\u00b0C and 125 rpm, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,800 \u00d7 g and 4\u00b0C for 45 min, and pellets were stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\n## Purification of ecTrxB and bsTrxB\nE. coli BL21 (DE3) cell pellets obtained after expression of B. subtilis 168 (bsTrxB) or E. coli MG1655 TrxB (ecTrxB) and were resuspended in 30 mL lysis buffer 1 (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8) containing 2 mL of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Cells were disrupted by passing the cell suspension three times through a constant cell disruption system (TS benchtop; Constant Systems, Daventry, UK) at 1.9 kbar and 4\u00b0C, followed by the addition of the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to a final concentration of 1 mM. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 6,700 \u00d7 g and 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The supernatant was vacuum-filtered through a 0.45-\u00b5m filter. Proteins were purified using Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC). The supernatant was loaded onto a Pierce Centrifuge Column pre-packed with 2 mL HisPur Ni-NTA-Resin (Thermo Fischer Scientific) and pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer 1. The column was then washed with lysis buffer 1, supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, followed by one washing step with lysis buffer 1 containing 20 mM imidazole. Proteins were eluted by adding elution buffer 1 (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Elution fractions containing the respective protein were combined, filled to 50 mL with lysis buffer 1, and concentrated to 1 mL using a Vivaspin 20 PES, MWCO 10000 concentrator system (Sartorius Stedim Biotech). The latter step was repeated twice to reduce imidazole concentration in the buffer. To remove the SUMO tag, ecTrxB and bsTrxB were digested with a His6-tagged SUMO Ulp1 protease, using a 75-fold excess (wt/wt) protein to protease. After overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C, the reaction mixtures were purified using IMAC as described above. Wash fractions containing the purified and untagged TrxBs were concentrated using Vivaspin 20 PES, MWCO 10000 concentrator system (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) to a final volume of 1 mL. Proteins were stored in lysis buffer 1 supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) glycerol at \u221280\u00b0C.\n\n## Analysis of TrxB inhibition by auranofin using a DTNB reduction assay\nTrxB activity in the absence or presence of auranofin was determined by performing a 5,5\u2032-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid (DTNB) reduction assay. In this NADPH-dependent assay, TrxB reduces DTNB directly to yield the spectrophotometrically detectable 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB). DTNB assays were performed in transparent, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany) as described by Lu et al. (36). Briefly, 1 \u00b5M ecTrxB or bsTrxB was added to TE buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 200 \u00b5M NADPH (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) for 5 min, in a total volume of 100 \u00b5L. The enzymatic reaction was then initiated by adding 100 \u00b5L TE buffer containing 2 mM DTNB (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). The amount of liberated TNB was then quantified spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 412 nm for 15 min. Experiments containing auranofin ranging from 0.1 to 2 \u00b5M (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 \u00b5M) were performed in triplicate. The remaining TrxB activity after adding auranofin was normalized to activity in the absence of auranofin, which was set to 100%.\n\n## Proteomic profiling of auranofin-stressed \n2D PAGE-based proteomic analysis was performed as previously described (37). For the analysis of the proteomic response of E. coli to auranofin exposure, E. coli MG1655 was used. Briefly, a stock of auranofin was dissolved in DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. E. coli MG1655 cells were grown in Neidhardt MOPS minimal medium (32) at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm until an OD500 of 0.35 was reached. Cultures were split into an untreated control and a culture treated with a sublethal concentration of 120 \u00b5g/mL. After 10 min, newly synthesized proteins were labeled with 0.37 MBq/mL L-[35S]-methionine (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). After 5 min, protein synthesis was stopped by the addition of 100 \u00b5g/mL chloramphenicol and non-radioactive L-methionine (to a final concentration of 1 mM L-methionine and 10 mM Tris originally set to pH 7.5 in the stock solution). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with 100 mM Tris/1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication with a VialTweeter (Hielscher, Teltow, Germany), and the supernatant was recovered after centrifugation. The protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay (Roti NanoQuant, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Protein biosynthesis rates were determined by measuring the incorporation of radioactive methionine in auranofin-treated and untreated samples after protein precipitation with 20% (wt/vol) trichloro acetic acid using a scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2800TR, PerkinElmer). 55 \u00b5g of protein from pulse-labeled samples for analytical gels and 300 \u00b5g of protein from unlabeled samples for preparative gels were rehydrated into IPG strips (24 cm, pH 4\u20137; GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK). A Multiphor II (GE Healthcare) was used for isoelectric focusing, and for the second dimension PAGE, the Ettan DALTwelve system (GE Healthcare) was used. The gels were stained with ruthenium(II)tris(4,7-diphenyl-1, 10-phenantrolin disulfonate) and washed with ethanol and acetic acid (38). Fluorescent gel images were taken with the Typhoon Trio+ Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare) using an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and an emission filter of 600 nm. Radio-labeled analytical gels were dried onto Whatman paper and exposed to Storage Phospho Screens (GE Healthcare). The phospho screens were scanned with the Typhoon Trio+ with an excitation wavelength of 633 nm and an emission filter of 390 nm. For visualization and analysis of the 2D gels, the Decodon Delta 2D image analysis software was used (39). Two biological replicates with one technical replicate each were analyzed against their respective controls for quantitation. Protein spots detected as twofold upregulated compared to the untreated control based on relative signal intensity were defined as marker proteins upon visual inspection (37).\nProtein identification from gel spots was performed as described previously (40). Spots were excised from a non-radioactive 2D gel and destained with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 30% acetonitrile. The protein spots were digested with either 12.5 ng/\u00b5L trypsin for low-intensity or 6.25 ng/\u00b5L trypsin for high-intensity spots (Promega, Fitchburg, FI, USA) for 18 h at 37\u00b0C. Peptides were eluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in MS-grade water and ultrasonicated for 15 min once (or twice if they were low-intensity spots). For protein identification, the samples were analyzed using a nanoACQUITY-UPLC-coupled SYNAPT G2-S high-definition mass spectrometer equipped with a NanoLockSpray Source for electrospray ionization and a time-of-flight detector (Waters, Milford, USA). The samples were loaded into a trap column (C18, pore size 100 \u00c5, particle diameter of 5 \u00b5m and an inner diameter of 180 \u00b5m, length 20 mm) and eluted with 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile gradient (350 \u00b5L/min, linear gradient 2%\u20135% acetonitrile in 2 min, 5%\u201360% acetonitrile in 20 min) from an analytical column (C18, pore size 130 \u00c5, particle diameter of 1.7 \u00b5m and an inner diameter of 75 \u00b5m, length 150 mm) at 40\u00b0C and subjected to mass spectrometry. The spectra were recorded in a mass range of 50\u20131,800 m/z with a 0.5 s/scan in positive mode. The following parameters were used for the NanoLockSpray source: capillary voltage of 1.5 kV; sampling cone voltage of 30 V; source temperature of 100\u00b0C; desolvation temperature of 150\u00b0C; cone glass flow 50 L/h; and desolvation gas flow of 550 L/h. Leucine enkephalin was used as a lock mass analyte using the lock spray channel (lock spray capillary voltage, 2.5 kV). Analysis of spectra was performed by MassLynx V4.1 SCN813 (Waters).\nFor protein identification, a non-redundant version of the E. coli MG1655 protein database (NCBI Bio Project accession PRJNA647163) with 4740 protein entries (plus the sequences of trypsin and human keratin) and the ProteinLynxGlobalServer (PLGS) software V3.5.3 (Waters) with the following parameters were used: chromatographic peak width, automatic; MS ToF resolution, automatic; lock mass window, 0.3 Da; low energy threshold, 50 counts. Other parameters were as follows: peptide tolerance, automatic; fragment tolerance, automatic; minimal fragment ion matches per peptide, 2; minimal fragment ion matches per protein, 5; minimal peptide matches per protein, 2; maximum protein mass, 250 kDa; primary digest reagent, trypsin; secondary digest reagent, none; missed cleavages, 1; fixed modifications, carbamidomethyl C; variable modifications, deamination N and Q, oxidation M; false-positive rate, 4%. The following parameters were considered for protein assignment: Coverage of identified protein was >10%, at least three peptide ions and five product ions were assigned, and theoretical pI and MW were consistent with the spot\u2019s position on the 2D gel.\n\n## RoGFP2 expression in bacteria\nTo measure the redox state in the cytoplasm of E. coli MG1655 and B. subtilis 168, cells were transformed with the pCC_roGFP2 plasmid as described (33) and pSG1729_roGFP2, respectively. pSG1729_roGFP2 cannot replicate in B. subtilis, but part of it integrates into the amyE locus on the chromosome through a double-crossover event. To create pSG1729_roGFP2, the EGFP insert from pSG1729 (34) was removed using KpnI and HindIII restriction enzymes. The gene sequence of roGFP2, codon-optimized for B. subtilis, was amplified from pMX_roGFP2 (Thermo Fischer Scientific) by PCR. Restriction sites for KpnI and HindIII were introduced using the primers JY001_for and JY001_rev. Plasmid construction followed standard procedures and was performed in E. coli DH5\u03b1. After successful plasmid construction, confirmed by sequencing, pSG1729_roGFP2 was transformed into B. subtilis 168 using standard protocols (Anagnostopoulos and Spizizen, 1961), and selection for chromosomal insertion of the plasmid was performed on LB plates containing 100 \u00b5g/mL spectinomycin. Double crossover of positive clones was confirmed by the inability to hydrolyze starch on LB plates containing 0.5% starch and subsequent PCR amplification of the chromosomal insert and sequencing of the PCR product.\nFor roGFP2 expression in E. coli MG1655, cells were grown in MOPS medium at 37\u00b0C and 125 rpm. 200 \u00b5M of IPTG was used to induce protein expression at an OD600 of 0.4\u20130.6, and roGFP2 was subsequently expressed for 16 h at 20\u00b0C and 125 rpm in an MOPS medium. After expression, cells were harvested, washed in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (40 mM, pH 7.4), and adjusted to an OD600 of 1.2.\nFor roGFP2 expression in B. subtilis 168, a single colony was inoculated in DSM medium [Bacto nutrient broth 0.8% (wt/vol), KCl 13.4 mM, MgSO4 1 mM, Ca(NO3)2 1 mM, MnCl2 10 \u00b5M, FeSO4 1 \u00b5M] containing 0.1% xylose (wt/vol), and cells were grown for 16 h at 30\u00b0C and 200 rpm. Cells were harvested, washed in BMM medium (41), and incubated for 30 min at 25\u00b0C and 800 rpm in a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The final OD600 was adjusted to 5. Cells were treated with 200 \u00b5M aldrithriol-2 (Sigma-Aldrich) (AT-2) as an oxidation control and 2 mM dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich) as a reduction control. 0.5, 1, and 5 \u00b5M auranofin were used as treatment. As AT-2 and auranofin were dissolved in DMSO, an equivalent volume of DSMO was added to all samples as vehicle control. 1 mL of cell suspension was added to a 1,500 \u00b5L Quartz Suprasil fluorescence cuvette (Hellma, M\u00fcllheim, Germany) with a stirring bar. Measurements were done at 25\u00b0C in a JASCO FP-8500 fluorescence spectrometer equipped with the temperature-controlled sample holder \u201cEHC-813\u201d at 25\u00b0C for 60 min under continuous stirring. Measurement parameters in E. coli were as follows: 510 nm (Em), 350\u2013500 nm (Ex), 5 nm slit width (Ex/Em), and medium sensitivity. After stabilization, respective treatments were added at the indicated final concentrations, and a time series of 61 additional spectra was recorded. Measurement parameters for B. subtilis were as follows: 520 nm (Em), 350\u2013500 nm (Ex), 10 nm slit width (Ex/Em), and high sensitivity. After stabilization, respective treatments were added at the indicated final concentrations, and a time series of 61 additional spectra was recorded. The ratios of the fluorescence excitation intensities (405/488 nm) were used to calculate the probe\u2019s oxidation state. All values were normalized to fully oxidized (AT-2-treated) and fully reduced (DTT-treated) roGFP2 with the following equation (1):\nRox is the 405/488 nm ratio of oxidized (AT-2 treated) and Rred of reduced (DTT-treated) cells expressing roGFP2, respectively. I488ox and I488red are the fluorescence intensities at 488 nm under oxidizing (i.e., AT-2) or reducing (i.e., DTT) conditions. R is the measured 405/488 nm ratio of the sample.\nFor calculation and normalization of the probe\u2019s oxidation degree at each time point, the means of all values recorded at all time points for Rred, Rox, I488ox, and I488red were used. Data were processed using Microsoft Excel software and GraphPad Prism version 10.1.0.\n\n## Auranofin is antibacterial but less effective against \nPrevious studies have shown that auranofin possesses potent bactericidal activity against many Gram-positive bacteria but seems to be markedly less effective against pathogenic Gram-negative species (22\u201324). However, the reasons for the poor susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to auranofin are not entirely clear. We analyzed the antimicrobial activity of auranofin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains by MIC assays. For this purpose, we added various concentrations of auranofin to a defined number of bacterial cells of B. subtilis 168, S. aureus DSM 20231/ATCC 43300, P. aeruginosa DSM 50071, A. baumanni DSM 30007, and E. coli DSM 30083 and examined their growth after overnight incubation. The MIC was defined as the lowest auranofin concentration, at which no visibly perceptible bacterial growth was observed. In line with expectations, auranofin showed potent growth inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria, with an MIC of 0.5 \u00b5g/mL for each Gram-positive strain tested (Table 3). The MIC values determined for auranofin against S. aureus and B. subtilis correlate with those reported in previous studies (22\u201324). By contrast, auranofin exhibited poor antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, with MICs of 128 \u00b5g/mL, 32 \u00b5g/mL, and 512 \u00b5g/mL against E. coli, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa, respectively, which agrees with previous reports (22, 27).\n\n## Auranofin causes upregulation of proteins involved in central metabolism and the defense against oxidative stress in \nTo understand whether auranofin exposure leads to a markedly different cellular response in Gram-negative bacteria, we performed proteomics experiments in E. coli. We compared our results to the results previously obtained for B. subtilis (42). In our experiments, we treated an exponentially growing culture of E. coli MG1655 with a sublethal concentration of 120 \u00b5g/mL auranofin. This concentration was found to partially inhibit bacterial growth by 26.27% \u00b1 4.14% (Fig. 1a). Upon exposure to auranofin for 10 min, the cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with L-[35S]-methionine, which was incorporated into newly synthesized proteins. Quantification of total L-[35S]-methionine incorporation revealed no significant difference between the control and the auranofin-treated culture, suggesting that auranofin does not directly inhibit protein synthesis (Fig. 1b).\nNewly synthesized proteins were quantified by densitometry of radioactive spots after two-dimensional PAGE. Auranofin-induced changes in protein synthesis patterns were visualized by overlaying the gel images of the L-[35S]-methionine-labeled proteins under control conditions (green) and after treatment with auranofin (red). Protein spots synthesized only under control conditions appear in green; protein spots that were synthesized only upon auranofin treatment appear in red, whereas protein spots synthesized under both conditions appear yellow. Out of the three independent experiments, a representative dual-channel image produced from autoradiographs of 2D gels obtained for control and auranofin-treated cells is shown in Fig. 1c. Auranofin treatment caused a more than twofold increase in relative synthesis rates of 30 protein spots (indicated by arrows). From non-radioactive gels, proteins could be identified by mass spectrometry in 20 of those spots (Fig. 1c; Table 4).\nMost identified marker proteins upregulated in response to auranofin treatment are associated with a specific response to oxidative stress and/or involved in cellular processes such as ROS detoxification, central metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and metal homeostasis.\nMany of the upregulated proteins are enzymes of the central metabolic network, such as GpmM (phosphoglycerate mutase), PykF (pyruvate kinase I), Lpd (lipoamide dehy",
