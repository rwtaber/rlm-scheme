The release rate depended on the drug and its concentration-a maximum of released drug of less than 40% over 24 hours was observed for promazine. The influence of the drug associations on the antibacterial properties was concentration-dependent since, at low concentrations (high nanocarrier/drug ratio), the activity was lost, probably due to the high affinity of the drug to nanocarriers and slow release rate, whereas at higher concentrations, the activity was well maintained for the majority of the drugs. Chlorpromazine and thioridazine increased the uptake of the LNCs by bacteria compared with blank LNCs, even below the minimum inhibitory concentration.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nDespite the abundance of antibiotics on the pharmaceutical market, their use has become increasingly limited due to the emergence of multidrug resistance among the microorganisms. The reason underlying this accelerated drug resistance has mostly been attributed to the abuse and misuse of antibiotics, bringing back the threat of bacterial infections many years after the first patients were cured [1]. Consequently, researchers have been focusing their work on finding new approaches to overcome this worldwide crisis. Some of them have devoted their efforts to the development of new semi-synthetic molecules to overcome specific bacterial resistance mechanisms by modulating the structures of existing antibiotics [2,3], while others have synthetized customized molecules for new bacterial targets [4]. Studies in this domain have brought to light that numerous compounds, belonging to different pharmacological families, bear significant antibacterial activity. Examples of such \u201cnon-antibiotics\u201d include antihistamines, such as promethazine [5] and fluphenazine [6], antipsychotic compounds, such as promazine, chlorpromazine [7], thioridazine [8], trifluoperazine [9] and triflupromazine [10], anti-inflammatory agents, such as diclofenac [11], and even antihypertensive agents, such as methyl-DOPA [12] and propranolol [13]. To date, antipsychotic and antihistamine agents from the group of phenothiazines have been studied most extensively for their antimicrobial action both in vitro and in vivo [14]. Drug repurposing is now considered as an interesting approach to overcome the drawbacks of conventional antibiotics. Some of the key benefits of repositioning existing drugs to new indications include reduced time, cost and risk, as well as providing the means for safer and more effective treatments to be made available to patients. On the other hand, antipsychotic drugs are increasingly used in the population. By exerting antibacterial effects these drugs can cause selective pressure on bacteria and they could also promote antimicrobial resistance. It has been demonstrated that taking neuroleptic or antidepressant drugs was a risk factor for MRSA carriage [15].\nInadequate drug delivery to infected sites can lead to a low drug concentration at the target sites compared with that in the blood, which can be considered as a limitation of systemic drug delivery [16]. Moreover, sustained release of the drug might be desired to maintain high local concentrations for long periods of time without reaching systemic toxic concentrations [17]. Accordingly, nanomedicine could be considered as one of the most appropriate approaches for such cases since it allows for targeted delivery and prolonged release. Furthermore, in the case of lipophilic compounds, nanocarriers offer the possibility to obtain colloidal dispersions without using co-solvents. Another important advantage of these systems is that their solubilization capacity is retained on administration, in contrast to formulations based on conventional solubilization approaches [18,19]. In fact, using nanocarriers has already been adopted to enhance the activity of conventional antibiotics in vitro and in vivo [20].\nConsidering the high affinity of antipsychotic compounds to lipids [21], lipid-based nanocarriers offer an attractive delivery system for these drugs. Lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) are biomimetic nanocarriers used for the encapsulation of a broad variety of active ingredients. LNCs have numerous advantages such as good physical stability and manufacturability via a phase inversion temperature method, which is a low energy, organic solvent-free process [22,23]. LNCs contain an oily core composed of medium chain triglycerides and a surfactant shell made of a PEGylated surfactant and optionally a co-surfactant (usually lecithin). By varying the quantities of LNC ingredients (oil and surfactants) and by replacing or adding a co-surfactant and/or oil, the physicochemical and biological properties of the LNCs can be modified to obtain a delivery system optimized for a particular active ingredient and route of administration [24\u201328].\nBased on these findings, this study was conducted to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of 20 antipsychotic drugs belonging to different chemical classes against both reference and clinical strains of 5 bacterial species. Then, the six most active antipsychotics were associated with LNCs using different strategies, and their association efficiency and influence on the properties of the LNCs were examined and the in vitro drug release was studied. Another important purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of association with the LNCs on the antibacterial activity of the drugs. Finally, the uptake of the LNCs by bacteria was assessed based on the fluorescence of DiO-labelled blank and drug-loaded LNCs.\n\n## Materials\nAntipsychotic compounds of different groups: an indol alkaloid reserpine, first generation typical antipsychotic drugs such as phenothiazines (chlorpromazine hydrochloride, fluphenazine dihydrochloride, perphenazine, prochlorperazine dimaleate salt, promazine hydrochloride, promethazine hydrochloride, thioridazine hydrochloride, trifluoperazine dihydrochloride, triflupromazine hydrochloride, and trimeprazine tartrate), thioxanthenes (chlorprothixene hydrochloride, cis-(Z)-flupenthixol dihydrochloride), butyrophenon (haloperidol), benzamide ((\u00b1)-sulpiride) and second generation atypical antipsychotic drugs (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine hemifumarate salt, risperidone) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (France). Labrafac\u00ae WL1349 (caprylic/capric acid triglycerides) was kindly provided by Gattefoss\u00e9 S.A. (France). Lipoid\u00ae S75-3 (soybean lecithin) was kindly provided by Lipo\u00efd Gmbh (Germany). Solutol\u00ae HS15 (macrogol 15 hydroxystearate, polyoxyl 15 hydroxystearate; CAS number: 70142-34-6; molecular weight 963.24 g/mol; HLB 14\u201316) was kindly provided by BASF (Germany). Brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth was bought from bioM\u00e9rieux (France). Plates containing Columbia agar supplemented with sheep blood were obtained from Oxo\u00efd (France). DiO (DiOC18 (3), 3,3\u2019-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (France). All of the other solvents and chemicals were of analytical grade.\n\n## Preparation of LNCs\nBlank LNCs were produced at a concentration of 111mg/ml as described elsewhere [28]. The components of the LNCs: polyoxyl 15 hydroxystearate (846 mg), triglycerides (1028 mg), soybean lecithin (75 mg) and NaCl (90 mg) were weighted and mixed with 3 ml of water, heated to 90\u00b0C and cooled to 60\u00b0C. Three heating-cooling cycles were performed and during the last cooling cycle at the phase inversion temperature (80\u201383\u00b0C), the system was diluted with 12.5 ml of cold water.\nTo prepare chlorpromazine-loaded LNCs using a pre-loading strategy, the drug was weighed and mixed with other LNC ingredients before the addition of water and heating-cooling cycles.\nTo prepare drug-loaded LNCs using a post-loading strategy, the drugs were added to the blank LNC dispersions and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, which was adequate to attain dynamic equilibrium between the drugs associated with the LNCs and those in the surrounding medium.\nTo obtain DiO-labelled LNCs with a DiO concentration of 1 mg per gram of LNCs, 100 \u03bcl of DiO solution in acetone were added before the last cooling cycle.\n\n## Characterization of LNCs\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) with 173\u00b0 backscatter detection was used to determine the Z-average particle diameter and the polydispersity index (PDI) of the LNCs. Zeta potential was calculated after conversion of the electrophoretic mobility values, measured by laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) adopting the Smoluchowski equation. Zetasizer nano series Nano-ZS fitted with a helium-neon laser performing at 633 nm (Malvern Instruments, UK) was used to obtain both the DLS and LDV measurements. The analysis was performed at an LNC concentration of 1.85 mg/ml obtained after 60-fold dilution of the initial LNCs dispersion with Milli-Q water. Each investigation was performed at 25\u00b0C in triplicate.\n\n## Drug loading studies\nNon-associated drugs were separated from the LNCs using a combined ultrafiltration-centrifugation technique involving Amicon\u00ae Ultra-15 filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa (Millipore, USA), as described elsewhere [27]. 2 ml of sample were placed in the sample reservoir (donor phase) of the centrifugal device and were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 4000 g. The solution in the filtrate vial (acceptor phase) was then weighed and analysed for drug content by HPLC, as described below. The volume of the sample remaining in the filter device (containing associated drug) was increased to 2 ml with deionized water. Next, the LNC dispersion from the sample reservoir was diluted at least 20-fold with methanol to rupture the particles and to extract the associated drug, which was quantified by HPLC.\nThe association efficiency (AE) and drug loading (DL) were determined using the following equations:\nEE=[A\u2212BA]*100%(Eq 1)\nwhere A is the total amount (mass) of the drug, and B is the mass of the non-associated drug; and\nDL=[(A\u2212B)C]*100%(Eq 2)\nwhere C is the total weight of all of the components of the nanoparticles (the associated drug and the mass of surfactants and oil used for the preparation of the LNCs).\n\nThe in vitro release of the antipsychotic compounds was investigated using phosphate buffered solution (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1.4 mM NaH2PO4, 1.3 mM Na2HPO4 adjusted to pH = 7.4 with NaOH solution) as a release medium. Aliquots of 200 \u03bcl of the sample were introduced into 15 ml polypropylene tubes containing 1.8 ml of PBS. The samples were then incubated at 37\u00b0C at 100 rpm in a reciprocal shaking water bath. At predetermined time intervals, samples were withdrawn and placed in the Amicon\u00ae Ultra-15 centrifugal filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa, and the released drug was separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4000 g. After centrifugation, the solution from the filtrate vial (acceptor phase) was weighed, and the filtrate was assayed for drug content by HPLC. The LNC dispersion from the sample reservoir was standardized to 2 ml with PBS and was returned to a water bath to continue the release studies.\nThe release study data were fitted to a first-order equation:\nW=W\u221e(1\u2212e\u2212kt)(Eq 3)\nwhere W is the amount of drug released at time t (based on cumulative release), W\u221e is the amount of drug released at infinity, and k is the release rate constant [29].\n\n## Quantification of antipsychotic agents by HPLC\nThe drug contents were analyzed using an HPLC system previously described [25]. Briefly, standard solutions of the drugs (0.1\u20131000 \u03bcg/ml) were prepared in deionized water, and 20 \u03bcl of the standard or sample were injected into the SymmetryShield TM RP18 5 \u03bcm 4.6x250 mm column (Waters, USA). A flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was employed using mobile phase A composed of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, and mobile phase B, composed of 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile. A linear gradient was run: 20% B for 25 min, 45% B for 0.1 minute, 100% B for 4.9 minutes, 20% B for 0.1 minute, and 20% B for 14.9 minutes. The drug peaks had retention times of approximately 27.7 minutes for chlorpromazine, 28.4 minutes for chlorprothixene, 23.6 minutes for promazine, 31.0 minutes for thioridazine, 23.7 minutes for trifluoperazine and 30.1 minutes for trifluperazine. UV detection was performed at 200 nm. Empower\u00ae3 software was used for data collection and integration.\nThe method showed good linearity for all of the tested molecules (R2\u22650.999). The quantification limits were 1 \u03bcg/ml for chlorpromazine, chloprothixene, promazine and triflupromazine and 2 \u03bcg/ml for thioridazine and trifluoperazine. More than 85% of drug was recovered each time.\n\n## Bacterial strains\nAntibacterial activity was tested against five reference strains: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Acinetobacter baumannii AYE (ATCC BAA-1710) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (DSM 16609); and five clinical isolates: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (0702E0196), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0704C0134), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli (9007550201), Acinetobacter baumannii RCH and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae (16510661801). The clinical isolates were acquired from the University Hospital of Angers (France). Before starting the experiments, the bacteria were grown overnight on Columbia agar supplemented with sheep blood at 37\u00b0C.\n\n## Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\nA broth microdilution method was used to determine the MIC. To obtain the desired concentration range, serial two-fold dilutions of the samples in BHI were prepared. The microorganism suspension in 0.85% NaCl with optical density equal to that of the 0.5 McFarland standard was diluted 10 -fold with BHI medium. 50 \u03bcl of bacterial suspension in BHI broth were then added individually into each well of a sterile 96-well plate that already contained 50 \u03bcl of the tested sample or control. The positive control wells included only BHI and the bacterial suspension, whereas the negative control wells included exclusively BHI and the tested sample. The plates were finally incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. MIC tests were performed in triplicates on separate days. The MIC was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited the visible bacterial growth. MIC values were considered different if they varied by more than one dilution.\n\n## Time-kill assay\nThe microorganism suspension in 0.85% NaCl with optical density equal to that of the 0.6 McFarland standard was diluted 10 -fold with BHI medium. The samples were diluted to a volume of 1.98 ml with BHI broth and 20 \u03bcl of bacterial suspension were then added to each polypropylene tube. Bacterial suspension in BHI broth without tested formulation/compound was considered a control. The final suspensions were incubated at 37\u00b0C. Serial 100-fold dilutions were prepared in distilled water with 100 \u03bcl of suspension withdrawn from each tube after 0, 3, 6 and 24 hours. An overall amount of 100 \u03bcl of diluted and/or undiluted sample was transferred onto the agar surface and was spread gently to be well absorbed into the agar. The agar plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, and the colonies were eventually counted. Time-kill experiments were performed in triplicates on separate days.\n\n## Flow cytometry\nThe bacterial suspension in 0.85% NaCl with optical density equal to that of the 1.0 McFarland standard was diluted 10 -fold with BHI medium. The samples were diluted to a volume of 9.9 ml with BHI broth, and 100 \u03bcl of bacterial suspension were then added to each polypropylene tube. The microorganisms were incubated for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C with DiO-labelled blank, thioridazine- and chlorpromazine-loaded LNCs at concentrations corresponding to 2 and 0.5 MICs. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation (3000 g, 10 minutes) and suspended in PBS. Two washing cycles were performed. All of the analyses were performed using a MACSquant\u00ae flow cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, France). The instrument was set up to measure the size (forward scatter), granularity (side scatter) and bacterial cell fluorescence. DiO uptake was measured by analysing individual cells for fluorescence. The mean fluorescence intensity was determined after correction for cell auto-fluorescence, and fluorescence histograms were obtained for 5000 individual events. The data were analysed using the MACSQuantify\u2122 software and are expressed as percentages of control fluorescence in arbitrary units. All of the experiments were conducted at least 3 times.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nThe statistical significance of the differences between samples was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.\n\nTo date, research has focused on the antibacterial activity of phenothiazine derivatives. However, there are many antipsychotic drugs on the market characterized by different structures and mechanisms of action. Therefore, the first aim of this paper was to examine whether they exhibit antibacterial effects. For that reason, a wide range of antipsychotic drugs, including typical and atypical antipsychotic agents, reserpine and some phenothiazine derivatives used mainly as antihistamines, was selected. The MIC values of the tested compounds that displayed antibacterial activity are shown in Table 1.\nNone of the investigated atypical antipsychotic compounds (aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone), reserpine, haloperidol (butyrophenon) and sulpiride (benzamide) showed antibacterial against tested bacterial strains (MIC>1024 \u03bcg/ml; not shown). Phenothiazines and thioxanthenes showed activity with variable MIC results, depending on the bacterial strains. There were similarities in the antibacterial activity between the groups since their MIC values were not different by more than one serial dilution, which was observed by comparing chlorpromazine with chlorprothixene and fluphenazine with flupentixol. Those compounds had MIC values of 32\u201364 \u03bcg/ml against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and 64\u2013128 \u03bcg/ml against Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This resemblance could be explained by, in both chemical classes, the compared drugs having the same molecular structure with the only difference of a double bond to the side chain that replaces the nitrogen atom at position 10 of the b ring facing the sulphur atom at position 5 of the phenothiazine ring in the case of the thioxanthene group. In the phenothiazines group, perphenazine was the least active in all cases with an MIC \u2265 1024 \u03bcg/ml against Gram-negative strains and 512 \u03bcg/ml against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Prochlorperazine also showed considerably less activity than other phenothiazines. Flupenthixol displayed strong activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli showed little or no sensitivity to this compound. Other phenothiazines showed similar activity with MIC values between 32 and 128 \u03bcg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and 64\u2013256 \u03bcg/ml against Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. Promazine, the most hydrophilic compound, exhibited broad spectrum antibacterial activity with the smallest variations in MIC values between all of the tested strains (128\u2013512 \u03bcg/ml). Antibacterial activity is not correlated with antipsychotic activity. For instance, the equivalent doses of oral antipsychotics were 100 mg for chlorpromazine and 5 mg for trifluoperazine (50 -fold difference), whereas the variation in MIC of these compounds was much smaller (0\u20134 -fold depending on the strain). Interestingly, the antibacterial effects of phenothiazines and thioxanthens were independent of the antibiotic resistance. Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus strains were the most sensitive to the tested drugs since their MIC was 32\u201364 \u03bcg/ml, except for prochlorperazine, trimeprazine, promazine and promethazine, which were slightly less active, with an MIC of 128\u2013256 \u03bcg/ml. Gram-negative strains were generally more resistant to antipsychotic drugs than Staphylococcus aureus. The target for antipsychotic drugs is probably the cytoplasmic membrane, which is present in both, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [14]. To reach this target, the molecules have to penetrate the bacterial envelope, which has different structure in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Although the peptidoglycan layer in Gram-positive bacteria is thicker than in Gram-negative bacteria, the former do not contain the outer membrane. The difference in sensitivity to antipsychotic agents is due to the barrier properties of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, which is an asymmetric phospholipid bilayer into which specific uptake channels and unspecific porins are embedded. Thus, the penetration of hydrophilic drugs is size -limited by narrow pores [30,31]. In the outer leaflet, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are anchored by their lipid A fractions, while their polar polysaccharide moieties are projected to the outside of the surface [32]. The inner core of the LPS forms a pseudo-static gel-like structure, caused by the hydrocarbons chains, which slows the penetration of hydrophobic molecules [33]. This finding explains the higher MIC values in the case of Gram-negative strains since all of the tested phenothiazine and thioxanthenes derivatives are hydrophobic. The moderate influx of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds across the outer membrane is additionally antagonized by active efflux transporters dispersed within the inner membrane and interacting with other components of the periplasmic space and the outer membrane to form trans-envelope complexes [34]. Among all of the investigated bacterial strains, both clinical and reference strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most resistant to antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine, promethazine and promazine being the most active, having an MIC ranging from 256 \u03bcg/ml to 1024 \u03bcg/ml. This finding could be explained by the synergistic action of the very low permeability of this bacterium\u2019s outer membrane, acquired by the use of slow porins instead of the classical trimeric porins, and by the multidrug efflux systems that are characterized by their broad substrate specificity and their constitutive expression [35].\nThe MICs of all tested antipsychotic agents were considerably lower than those of conventional antibiotics (usually below 1\u20132 \u03bcg/ml). Additionally, the MICs of antipsychotics are higher than physiological concentrations of these drugs. High MIC values limit their potential use as antibacterial agents on their own. Nonetheless it is important to examine different aspects of interactions of antipsychotic agents with bacteria, because they can be harmful to patients by increasing the selection pressure in the microorganisms. When the microorganisms are exposed to sublethal concentrations of antipsychotic agents the resistance to these compounds can potentially develop. However, both these drawbacks (i.e. high MIC values and possibility to develop resistance) can be overcome by using antipsychotic drugs in combination with other antimicrobial agents. Indeed, many phenothiazines have shown synergistic interactions with several antibiotics thereby lowering the doses administered to patients [14].\nThe time-kill curves of antipsychotic compounds are shown in Fig 1. The concentrations used for this assay were equal to 2 MIC of each corresponding drug. Generally, all of the tested drugs had a bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii since the number of colonies was reduced by more than 3 Log in both cases. A sharp decrease in CFU number was observed within three hours of incubation, in good agreement with previously reported data [36]. Phenothiazines affect the components of plasma membrane, such as efflux pumps, energy sources and energy providing enzymes (e.g., ATPase). They also have an influence of genes that code for the permeability aspect of a bacterium [14]. Rapid bactericidal action of antipsychotic drugs could be the result of their effects on the plasma membrane.\n\n## Properties of drug-loaded LNCs\nThe characteristics of the lipid nanocapsules, prepared using pre-loading and post-loading strategy, are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. LNC formulations containing chlorpromazine at 0.5 and 2 mg/ml were successfully obtained using the pre-loading strategy. Nevertheless, after an increase in the chlorpromazine concentration to 8 mg/ml, the LNCs could not be obtained because the phase inversion did not occur, and aggregation and phase separation were observed. Higher concentrations, such as 33 mg/ml, were easily achieved by using the post-loading strategy. The possibility of achieving high drug concentrations is therefore an important advantage of the post-loading strategy. Moreover, post-loading could also be the preferred option for drugs sensitive to high temperatures because, in this approach, the drug does not undergo heating-cooling cycles. Generally, most of the antipsychotic compounds were efficiently associated with the LNCs since they presented an association efficiency greater than 90% at all of the tested concentrations. The association was slightly affected by the drug\u2019s concentration in the cases of chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, thioridazine and triflupromazine since it remained greater than 90% at 33 mg/ml of drug, although a significant reduction in association efficiency was observed. However, the association efficiency was significantly decreased from 99% and 95% to 68.9% and 49.3% when the drug\u2019s concentration increased from 0.5 mg/ml to 33 mg/ml in the cases of trifluoperazine and promazine, respectively. Interestingly, there was no difference in the association efficiency of chlorpromazine between the pre- and post-loading strategies since they both presented similar association efficiency values of 96% and 93% at concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml of chlorpromazine, respectively. In addition, the drug loading of almost all of the tested formulations increased proportionally to the increasing drug\u2019s concentration and reached approximately 21% at 33 mg/ml, apart from trifluoperazine and promazine, which reached, at the same concentration, drug loading of only 15.7% and 11.2%, respectively due to their lower association efficiency. High drug loading is desirable since it enables achieving therapeutic concentrations and reduces the concentration of the nanocarrier, thereby minimizing possible toxic effects [37]. Indeed, the drug concentrations that could be achieved in LNC formulations, e.g., for chlorpromazine, were higher than in the manufactured products, indicating that this level of association is satisfactory.\nGenerally, apart from promazine, there was no significant difference in particle size between blank and drug-loaded LNCs at drug concentrations of 0.5, 8 and 33 mg/ml. Interestingly, at a drug concentration of 2 mg/ml, the particle size significantly increased from approximately 50 nm to 70 nm. In the case of promazine, the particle size increased from 53 nm to 71 nm when the drug concentration increased from 0.5 to 8 mg/ml and then decreased to 62 nm at a drug concentration of 33 mg/ml. There was no difference in the particle size between the two loading strategies since the particle size increased from 53 to 75\u201377 nm when the drug\u2019s concentration increased from 0.5 to 2 mg/ml in the case of chlorpromazine-loaded LNCs for both the pre- and post-loading strategies. There was no important difference in the polydispersity index of the LNCs, reflecting the homogeneous size distribution of the nanocapsules.\nIn all cases, the LNCs became positively charged after being loaded with the antipsychotic compounds. Their zeta potential increased proportionally to the increase in the drug concentration from a negative value of \u20135.81 mV for blank LNCs to positive values that reached a maximum of +34.77 mV in the case of chlorpromazine-loaded LNCs. Similar behaviour (i.e., an increase in zeta potential corresponding to increasing concentrations of associated molecules) was observed for peptide-loaded LNCs [27]. These changes in zeta potential could be explained by, the antipsychotic drugs, which are positively charged due to the amino groups in their structure and, consequently, high pKa, being located on the surface of the lipid nanocapsules, thereby changing the surface charge from negative to positive. Theoretically, the adsorption of antipsychotic drugs on LNCs could be driven by electrostatic interactions between amino groups of drugs and phosphate groups of lecithin, dipole-ion interactions between a negative dipole on PEG molecules and a positive charge on drug molecules and hydrophobic interactions, similar to previously described amphiphilic peptides [27]. We performed additional experiments with adsorption on LNCs composed solely of macrogol 15 hydroxystearate and triglycerides, without lecithin, and the association efficiency values were similar to those observed for the LNCs containing lecithin (not shown). Therefore, it could be concluded that the interactions between lecithin molecules and antipsychotic drugs are not important for drug adsorption and that the adsorption is driven by dipole-ion interactions and hydrophobic interactions between the drugs and components of the LNCs. Interestingly, the adsorption of antipsychotic drugs was much higher than that observed for peptides on lecithin -LNCs under similar conditions (17\u201333%) [27], perhaps because of the peptide-resistant character of PEG moieties caused by steric stabilization effects. The molecules of antipsychotic drugs are much smaller than those of peptides; therefore, the steric stabilization effects are less important.\n\nThis in vitro release study of antipsychotic compounds from the LNCs was performed to: (i) confirm the success of the drugs\u2019 associations; (ii) understand the release kinetics and mechanisms; and (iii) determine the effect of the drugs\u2019 concentration on the release profile. Among the six encapsulated antipsychotic compounds, only promazine and chlorpromazine were released from the LNCs (Fig 2), whereas no drug was discharged in the cases of thioridazine, trifluoperazine, triflupromazine and chlorprothixene (not shown). The retention of the antipsychotic drugs in the LNCs could be explained by the high affinity of these hydrophobic compounds to the LNCs, possibly due to surface activity of the drugs and their interactions with the components of the core and sh",
