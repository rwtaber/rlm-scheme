  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAcinetobacter baumannii stands out as a prominent pathogen accounting for a wide variety of severe infections affecting patients in intensive care units (ICUs), such as pneumonia, bacteremia, skin and soft tissue infections, wounds, urinary tract infections, and secondary meningitis [1]. Ventilator-associated pneumonia stands out among the most severe nosocomial infections attributable to multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR), or pan drug-resistant (PDR; with resistance to all antibiotics available on the market) A. baumannii strains, closely followed by catheter-related bacteremia [2, 3].\nThe success of A. baumannii infection is due to several factors, such as the ability to form biofilms, resistance to desiccation on abiotic surfaces, ability to adhere, colonize, and invade human epithelial cells, potential to acquire genetic material through horizontal gene transfer, and to antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. The diverse and complex antibiotic resistance repertoire can occur through four main mechanisms: the presence of efflux pumps (perform drug extrusion), outer membrane protein modifications or the presence of capsule (make it difficult or prevent drug penetration), changes in the site of action (prevent drug binding), and enzymatic inhibition (cause enzymatic inactivation of drugs) [4]. Among them, the enzyme inhibition mechanism is the most prevalent and worrying is related to the production of a wide variety of \u03b2-lactamases, which make strains resistant to different \u03b2-lactam agents, in particular to carbapenems, considered first-line antimicrobials for the treatment of infections caused by A. baumannii [5].\nDisordered use of antibiotics leads to increased selective pressures and consequently causes the emergence and dissemination of drug-resistant pathogens. Consequently, A. baumannii strains resistant to carbapenems (CRAB) were identified as one of the leading causes of infections associated with health care worldwide, particularly in ICUs [6]. These trends have forced the exploration of new antibiotic treatment approaches. According to the \u201cGlobal Priority List of Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to Guide Research, Discovery, and Development of New Antibiotics\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO), the carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii together with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae are considered critical priority number 1 for research and development of new effective antimicrobials [7].\nIdentifying interactions between drugs and essential targets of biological systems represents an important process in drug discovery. Regarding the need to discover new antibacterial drugs, both the research and development (R&D) of these molecules are costly (approximately 2.8 billion dollars) [8], time-consuming (approximately 13.5 years) and bear high failure rates, since only 10% of drug candidates at the clinical stage are successfully launched in the market [9, 10]. Drug repurposing has emerged as a promising strategy to find new antibacterial candidates to help overcome these limitations [11]. Drug repurposing aims to identify new applications for drugs already approved or in the final stages of clinical trials [12]. This approach has several advantages over traditional drug discovery processes. Firstly, drug repurposing uses existing safety and toxicity data, and it significantly reduces both the time and cost required for preclinical and early clinical development processes. Secondly, drug repurposing can help find unexpected and innovative action mechanisms, broadening the current understanding of drug biology and potentially identifying new therapeutic applications [12]. Thus, drug repurposing could help reduce costs, risks, and timelines to the market; consequently, it could provide a strategic advantage in identifying new treatments for A. baumannii infections.\nA growing collection of available computational and experimental methods that utilize molecular and clinical data enables diverse drug repositioning strategies. In this context, in silico chemogenomics approaches represent an effective strategy, as they compare the broad chemical spectrum of existing drugs with complete proteome and other potential drug targets. This approach helps identify compounds capable of acting on targets for which there is no known activity, but which have a homologous relationship with targets of active compounds already recognized [13, 14]. Molecular docking studies, in turn, represent a valuable approach for understanding the interaction between chemical compounds and their respective targets, through the exploration of ligand conformations in the binding sites of macromolecular targets. Docking also allows estimating the free energy of ligand-receptor binding, enabling the evaluation of critical phenomena involved in the intermolecular recognition process. In the context of drug repositioning, this tool can currently be used to predict new therapeutic indications for drugs with already optimized safety profiles, especially when used in addition to other computational methods, such as chemogenomics approaches [15]. Researchers willing to benefit from the wealth of genomic and proteomic information available for A. baumannii strains [16] can use computational chemogenomics tools to systematically identify potential drug candidates to fight this pathogen. This approach uses comprehensive genomic data to predict potential ligands capable of targeting specific proteins or pathways within A. baumannii based on the principle that proteins sharing enough similarity (homology) are more likely to share the same ligands [13, 17]. Current repurposing studies, based on computational chemogenomic strategies followed by experimental validation, generated promising results in the process of screening drugs showing activity against Paracoccidiodes spp. [17], Plasmodium spp. [18], Histoplasma capsulatum [19] and Mycobacterium abscessus [20]. These cutting-edge methods represent a significant leap forward in addressing the emergency posed by A. baumannii infections and hold great promise for future antimicrobial drug discoveries.\nConsidering the global threat of antimicrobial-resistant A. baumannii and their therapeutic challenges, this work aimed to carry out a computational chemogenomics approach to repurpose clinical trial-approved and candidate drugs; evaluate their in vitro activity against A. baumannii; select the most promising drug and analyze homology modeling and molecular docking interactions. The aforementioned approach comprised the following steps: (a) gathering and preparing A. baumannii genome data; (b) identifying homologous A. baumannii proteins in publicly available drug-target databases; (c) analyzing the evolutionary conservation level of prioritized A. baumannii targets, based on their phylogenetic association with homologs; and (d) conducting homology modeling and molecular docking studies. Tavaborole was prioritized for in vitro experimental validation against A. baumannii based on the designed pipeline. Antifungal tavaborole had minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 2 to 64 \u03bcg/ml against both A. baumannii standard ATCC strain and MDR clinical isolates, as well as showed strong potential to reduce both the biomass and metabolic activity of biofilms formed by MDR clinical isolates at the concentration of 16 \u03bcg/ml.\n\n## Repurposing putative drugs available in public databases\nDrug targets available in public databases were screened based on the assumption that homologous proteins are more likely to share the same ligands [13]. Sequence-based similarity search comprising A. baumannii proteins and all drug targets available on the Therapeutic Targets Database (TTD) [21] and DrugBank [22] was carried out based on using the OrthoVenn2 server [23]. A cut-off point of \u2264 10\u221215 for the expected value (E-value) was used to calculate pairwise sequence similarities among all input protein sequences. Subsequently, the sequence identity between A. baumannii proteins and their respective homologous targets was confirmed based on using the BLASTp server [24]. Sequence identity \u2265 30% was used as a cut-off point to prioritize A. baumannii proteins for subsequent analysis. Only paired A. baumannii proteins and drug targets with higher sequence identity or higher E-value were used for prospective investigations.\n\n## Data mining and computational prediction of essentiality\nThe datasets comprising homologous targets and corresponding drugs from DrugBank and TTD databases underwent merging and curation to eliminate redundancy. A stringent data mining procedure ensued to retain exclusively clinically approved or candidate drugs within the dataset. Drugs in experimental and investigative stages, as well as discontinued and illicit drugs, were excluded from the study. Finally, proteins associated with essential A. baumannii genes were identified and selected using the DEG database [25].\n\n## Comparing functional regions between drug targets and orthologs\nFASTA sequences of potential A. baumannii protein targets were subjected to ConSurf server [26] to enable estimating the evolutionary conservation of amino acids, based on their phylogenetic association with homologs. Firstly, 150 homologous sequences were imported from the UNIREF-90 database [27] based on using an E-value cut-off of 10\u22124. Redundant sequences (identity > 95%) or sequences with minimal identity (< 35%) were ignored. Then, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of homologous sequences was performed based on the MAFFT-L-INS-i method, whereas a phylogenetic tree was built by using neighbor-joining with maximum likelihood (ML) distance. Next, evolutionary conservation scores were calculated for position-specific amino acids, based on the empirical Bayesian method. Finally, local alignment was performed based on using the BLASTp server [24] to manually assess the sequence identity of conserved regions between A. baumannii proteins and their respective orthologous targets. Results were considered satisfactory when the conservation degree observed for active site residues was higher than, or equal, to 50% [13].\n\n## Rational selection of drugs\nTTD, DrugBank, and PubChem platforms [21, 22, 28] were used to gather information on the compounds\u2019 pharmacological properties and therapeutical indications of the selected drugs. Information about the molecular function of each target was collected in the UniProt database [29]. Metabolic pathways of the aforementioned targets were investigated in the Kegg Pathway database [30] and information about the subcellular location was collected in the Gram-LocEN database [31]. A literature search was carried out in the PubMed database [32] to identify approved drugs that had not yet been assessed against A. baumannii by querying all previously identified predicted drugs. Combinations of the following descriptors were used as a structured search strategy: (\u2019\u2019drug name\u2019\u2019 [MeSH Terms] OR \u2019\u2019drug name\u2019\u2019 [All Fields]) AND (\u2019\u2019Acinetobacter baumannii\u2019\u2019 [MeSH Terms] OR \u2019\u2019Acinetobacter baumannii\u2019\u2019 [All Fields]). Information about the chemical properties of both the investigated drugs and the biological properties of A. baumannii targets, which had been gathered at the previous research stage, was assessed for rational drug selection purposes. The following drug properties were analyzed: drug indication, absorption, distribution volume, protein binding, metabolism, excretion route, half-life, clearance, log P, log S, and toxicity. As for A. baumannii targets, the following parameters were assessed: molecular function, biological process, metabolic pathway, and subcellular location. Thus, some drugs at the clinical trial stage were ruled out because they were not available for purchase. Moreover, vaccines, nutraceutical compounds, coenzymes, genetic engineering vectors, and all compounds lacking information about their pharmacological properties, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity, were also discarded.\n\n## Target 3D structure prediction\nFASTA sequence of A. baumannii leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) (UniProt code: A0A7Z1WR47) was used as an input file for 3D structure prediction purposes, based on the following approaches: (i) homology modeling implemented in SWISS-MODEL server [33], (ii) threading method available in I-TASSER server [34], and (iii) ab initio method based on graph attention neural network available in AlphaFold server [35]. The 3D structure of Thermus thermophilus LeuRS (PDB ID: 2V0C, sequence identity: 46.88%) was used as a template for SWISS-MODEL prediction [36].\n\n## Geometric analysis of LeuRS 3D structure\nThe 3D geometric quality of the LeuRS model was investigated using the MolProbity server [37]. 3D structures presenting the most favorable Ramachandran angles (phi [\u03c6] and psi [\u03c8]) within the preferred regions, and the ones recording the lowest Clashscore and MolProbity score, were selected for further analysis.\n\n## Tavaborole binding site identification\nThe LeuRS model was subjected to the ConSurf server [26] to estimate the evolutionary conservation of amino acids based on their phylogenetic association with homologs [38] using the abovementioned parameters. At the same time, computational fragment mapping calculations were performed based on using the FTMap server [39] to identify small molecules binding hot spots in both the connective polypeptide 1 (CP1) amino acid editing domain and LeuRS\u2019s active site. FTMap can detect potential binding sites by using 16 small organic molecules with different shapes and polarities in a dense grid around the LeuRS structure.\n\n## Ligand and protein preparation\nThe 2D structure of tavaborole was imported into the Maestro workspace v.9.3 (Schr\u00f6dinger, LCC, New York, 2012). Subsequently, the 3D structure of tavaborole underwent meticulous optimization using the OPLS_2005 force field [40], a feature available on LigPrep v.2.5 (Schr\u00f6dinger, LCC, New York, 2012). Subsequently, tavaborole\u2019s 3D structure was imported to AcePrep, where it underwent preparation steps comprising counterions\u2019 removal, protonation, and generation of 10 conformers. Simultaneously, LeuRS\u2019s predicted 3D structure was prepared using the ProteinPrepare web application. Protonation state titration was calculated at pH 7.4, in PROPKA software, v.3.1, missing atoms were added, and this procedure was followed by overall hydrogen network optimization in PDB2PQR software, version 2.1.\n\n## Molecular docking\nMolecular docking studies were carried out at LeuRS\u2019s predicted binding sites in rDock software implemented in the AceDock server [41]. The analysis was conducted through a cross-docking approach, which comprises the application of ligand structures obtained from multiple PDB files of the same protein in comparison to a single rigid protein model structure. This process was performed by using the free docking mode and the pharmacophore-overlapping strategy [41]. The template ligand in the free docking mode was only used to establish the search space for the docking run; pose prediction was conducted by taking into consideration the rDock master scoring function. On the other hand, in pharmacophore-overlapping re-scoring, the predicted poses were assessed based on how well their pharmacophoric moieties (such as aromatic rings, and hydrogen bond donors, among others) align with those of the template ligand. The robustness of the docking protocol was assessed by calculating the enrichment rates (see details in S3 File) and root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the docked pose and the corresponding crystal conformer [42, 43]. RMSD values lower than 2.0 \u00c5 were considered satisfactory, whereas values close to zero were considered optimal.\n\n## MM/GBSA free energy calculation\nA combination of molecular docking simulation protocols and MM/GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) methodology were employed to investigate the interaction between tavaborole and LeuRS [44]. The MM/GBSA approach was utilized, incorporating computed molecular mechanics energies and implicit solvation models to determine the energy difference between the bound complexes (tavaborole-LeuRS). The estimation of relative binding affinity used the MM/GBSA module within the Prime Module of the Schr\u00f6dinger suite, employing the OPLS_2005 force field and VSGB solvation mode. Initially, the software initiates the process by minimizing the receptor-ligand complex and then calculates energies for each ligand, receptor, and combined complex. Subsequently, the \u0394G binding energy is computed using the following equation:\n\u0394Gbinding=\u0394Gtavaborole-LeuRS-\u0394Gtavaborole-\u0394GLeuRS\nThe MM/GBSA calculates the approximate binding energy of a receptor-ligand complex. A greater negative value indicates a more robust binding between the specified ligand and receptor [44].\n\n## Chemicals\nAll compounds were \u2265 95% pure, solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and stored as stock solutions at the concentration of 10 mg/ml. The following drugs prioritized for experimental validation purposes were purchased from ChemScene:\n\n## Microorganisms and culture conditions\nAll microbial clinical strains were derived from the Brazilian Culture Collection of the Tropical Pathology and Public Health Institute\u2014BCC-IPTSP (https://rgptb.iptsp.ufg.br/). Clinical strains\u2019 resistance profiles and biofilm formation ability were described by Castilho et al. [45]. In addition, a standard A. baumannii sample from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 19606) was used in this study. Isolates were reactivated in Luria Bertani (LB) agar (Kasvi) and incubated in a bacteriological incubator at 36\u00b0C, for 18 hours. Colonies isolated from each reactivated strain were used to mount microscope slides and stained by the Gram technique to assess both morphological features and purity of each bacterial isolate. All strains belonging to each isolated colony were inoculated in LB broth after their purity and viability were confirmed. After growing in an orbital shaking incubator at 36\u00b0C for 24h, strains were prepared for storage and working-aliquot maintenance. They were kept in 20% glycerol, in a freezer, at -20\u00b0C, to preserve the bacterial isolates used in the microbiological assays.\n\n## Determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\nThe broth microdilution method was applied to estimate candidate drugs\u2019 MIC by following standards set by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [46], with small modifications. Cultures were seeded in LB broth added with 0.05% Tween 80 and incubated in an orbital shaking incubator at 36\u00b0C, for 24h. After this period, bacterial cultures had turbidity assessed in a spectrophotometer (Kasuaki IL-226 Spectrophotometer, Jiangsu, China) at 590 nm; culture concentration was adjusted to 2x106 CFU/ml in LB. The antibiotic amikacin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used at 8 \u03bcg/ml as a positive inhibition control [CAMI]. Drugs\u2019 antimicrobial activity was assessed at the following concentrations: 1,024; 512; 256; 128; 64; 32; 16; 8; 4; 2; 1; 0.5; 0.25; 0.125 and 0.0625 \u03bcg/ml. After preparation, the plate was incubated at 36\u00b0C, for 24h. After the incubation period, 30 \u03bcl of resazurin solution (0.01%) was added to each well, according to the resazurin-based 96-well plate microdilution method, to determine MIC, with adaptations [47]. The plate was incubated again, at 36\u00b0C, and observed every 10 minutes to check color changes in the growth control wells [C+]. The MIC was determined as the lowest drug concentration at which resazurin wells remained blue through visual reading. Assays focused on assessing the antimicrobial potential of each drug were performed in triplicate and repeated at different time intervals.\n\n## MKT-077 antimicrobial susceptibility test\nMKT-077 is a synthetic heterocyclic pyridinium compound analogous to rhodacyanine dye; its dark orange color visually and colorimetrically affects experimental assays. Therefore, the serial microdilution method was used to assess the sensitivity degree of the analyzed strain, and it was followed by plating each serial drug dilution into Petri dishes covered with LB agar medium to find the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) [46]. A culture microplate was prepared and incubated in compliance with previously described procedures for other drugs, at the same concentration range: 1,024 to 16 \u03bcg/ml. After the incubation process at 36\u00baC for 24h was over, each culture microplate well was serially diluted at a scale of 10 (ranging from 10\u22121 to 10\u22126); then, 10 \u03bcl of dilutions ranging from 10\u22123 to 10\u22126 were seeded on Petri dishes added with LB agar. Aliquots of 10 \u03bcl extracted from [C\u2013] and [CAMI] wells without serial dilution were also seeded on a Petri dish added with LB agar. All Petri dishes were incubated in a bacteriological incubator at 36\u00b0C for 24h. After incubation, MBC was determined as the lowest MKT-077 concentration that fully inhibited bacterial growth.\n\n## Analyzing bacterial biofilm formation and mature biofilm inhibition\nThe estimated quantification of bacterial biofilm formation by clinical A. baumannii strains was performed in a microplate, based on the methodology described by Castilho et al. [45]. Cultures grown in LB broth were adjusted to the concentration of 2x106 CFU/ml; 100 \u03bcl of this suspension was added to 100 \u03bcl of LB broth\u20141/4 of its concentration added with glucose at 0.2% (final volume of 200 \u03bcl per well)\u2014and incubated at 28\u00baC, for 48h. Bacterial growth was measured in a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan SkyHigh Microplate Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, EUA), at 405 nm. Then, the supernatant was removed and wells were washed twice with 200 \u03bcl of PBS. The attached biofilm was stained with 0.2% crystal violet, washed again, and, subsequently, solubilized with ethanol/acetone at the ratio of 80:20 (v/v).\nCrystal violet staining assays were carried out to assess biofilm mass, and resazurin assays were used to estimate viable counts, to investigate likely tavaborole activity on mature biofilm. Previously formed biofilms were washed, as described above, and serially diluted tavaborole was added to them at final concentrations ranging from 2 to 16 \u03bcg/ml; then, the plate was incubated again for 24h. After the incubation, the supernatant was discarded and the wells were washed. The biofilm was stained with 0.2% crystal violet solution, again washed, and, subsequently, solubilized with 200 \u03bcl of ethanol/acetone at the ratio of 80:20 (v/v); absorbance was measured (OD 595 nm) and biomass reduction rate was calculated based on Shen et al. [48]. In total, 45 \u03bcl of resazurin solution (0.01%) was added to each test and control well to check mature biofilm cell viability after drug administration. The plate was incubated at 36\u00b0C and observed every 10 minutes to investigate resazurin reduction to resorufin; then, the reduction rate was calculated by measuring absorbance at 570 and 600 nm. Metabolic activity reduction rate was calculated based on das Neves et al. [47].\n\n## Statistical analysis\nAll assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at different intervals under each tested condition. Data deriving from tests conducted in vitro were inserted in an Excel spreadsheet. Both mean and standard deviation (SD) within samples were calculated. GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used for data analysis and graphical representation.\n\n## Computational chemogenomic analyses\nA computational chemogenomics framework was developed (Fig 1A) to repurpose drugs to treat bacterial infections based on predicted protein analysis applied to 3,732 genes (3,597 proteins) from A. baumannii genome (Genome Assembly ASM863263v1). Then, each one of these proteins was used to investigate two different publicly available databases, DrugBank and TTD, which provide detailed information about drugs and their targets. This strategy identified 918 potential bacterial targets (\u223c25.6% of the investigated A. baumannii targets; DrugBank: 1,402 orthologs; TTD: 676 orthologs) (Fig 1B) that might interact with 3,886 ligands.\nSubsequently, DrugBank and TTD were merged for manual data mining and duplicate removal purposes. In total, 483 protein targets were maintained in this phase; they corresponded to 1,995 drugs (1,392 from DrugBank and 603 from TTD). After additional data mining (to select approved drugs or drug candidates in clinical trials) and manual filtering (to keep only one ortholog protein per cluster) procedures were over, the information provided by DEG was used to both identify and select proteins associated with essential A. baumannii genes. In total, 164 protein targets were retained at the end of these selection processes; this number corresponded to 468 predicted drugs (403 from DrugBank and 65 from TTD).\nConSurf server was used to assess the active site conservation level among targets and determine the functional amino acids of drug targets. Then, local alignment was performed using the BLASTp server to compare A. baumannii protein sequences to therapeutic targets\u2019 sequences (orthologs). In total, 53 protein targets were selected at the end of this analysis; they corresponded to 153 drugs (101 from DrugBank and 52 from TTD).\nA search was conducted in the PubMed database to rule out previously assessed drugs showing antimicrobial activity against A. baumannii. Sixty known antibiotics were identified and excluded, including eleven currently used for treating A. baumannii clinical infections, such as amikacin, ampicillin, cefepime, and tigecycline among others. In total, 93 drugs (51 from DrugBank and 42 from TTD) targeting 33 proteins remained. The pharmacological properties and therapeutic indication of these drugs were analyzed through data collected from the TTD, DrugBank, and PubChem platforms. In total, 31 drugs (7 from DrugBank and 24 from TTD) were prioritized corresponding to 14 protein targets. Most of the drugs selected at this stage were previously featured as having anticancer activity (26%); they were followed by antivirals (19%), antimicrobials (16%), immunosuppressants (10%), antifungals (10%) and anthelmintics (10%) (Fig 1C).\nAmong all 31 selected drugs, seven were chosen for experimental analysis focused on investigating their potential use for repurposing against A. baumannii, based on previous analysis applied to homology rate, chemical structure diversity, pharmacological properties, and predicted target types. Thus, six FDA-approved drugs, atovaquone (A. baumannii predicted target: dihydroorotate dehydrogenase), homoharringtonine (50S ribosomal protein), leflunomide (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase), ribavirin (inosine-5\u2019-monophosphate dehydrogenase), tavaborole (leucyl-tRNA synthetase), and thiabendazole (succinate dehydrogenase), and one drug undergoing clinical studies, MKT-077 (DnaK protein chaperone), were herein selected (Table 1). Two drugs belonged to the anticancer therapeutic class (MKT-077 and homoharringtonine), one drug had antifungal (tavaborole) activity, one had antifungal and antiprotozoal activity (atovaquone), one was originally indicated as an immunosuppressant (leflunomide), one had antiviral activity (ribavirin) and one was used in classic therapy as an anthelmintic drug (thiabendazole). The pharmacokinetic properties of drugs obtained from the DrugBank, TTD, and PubChem databases are described in S1 Table.\n\n## Experimental assessment of selected drugs\nGrowth inhibition assays were conducted with the ATCC 19606 standard strain, at drug concentrations ranging from 1,024 to 0.0625 \u03bcg/ml, to assess the antimicrobial potential of drugs selected in the computational steps. MIC values observed for drug candidates are shown in Table 1. Among tested drugs, the antifungal tavaborole presented the most promising activity, with a MIC value of 2 \u03bcg/ml (13.2 \u03bcM). Ribavirin presented a MIC value of 4 \u03bcg/ml, whereas leflunomide showed a MIC value of 64 \u03bcg/ml. Both atovaquone and homoharringtonine recorded MIC values of 256 \u03bcg/ml. Thiabendazole, in turn, had a MIC value of 512 \u03bcg/ml against the investigated microbial strain.\nBecause tavaborole presented the best antimicrobial activity against the A. baumannii standard strain, among the herein-assessed drugs, the option was made to carry out a deeper analysis. Clinical isolates with different resistance profiles [45] were selected to assess tavaborole\u2019s antimicrobial potential against them. Table 2 presents MIC values recorded for standard strain ATCC 19606 and for all herein assessed 14 clinical strains (MIC values ranged from 2 to 64 \u03bcg/ml, with MIC50 = 2 \u03bcg/ml and MIC90 = 32 \u03bcg/ml).\nTo investigate the antimicrobial potential of MKT-077, which is dark orange, MBC was determined by testing this drug at concentrations ranging from 1,024 to 16 \u03bcg/ml. MBC recorded for the assessed standard strain was 1,024 \u03bcg/ml (S1 Fig).\nBecause tavaborole also presented antibacterial activity against clinical A. baumannii isolates when it was assessed in its planktonic form, an option was made to investigate its activity against mature biofilm, at concentrations ranging from 2 to 16 \u03bcg/ml. The investigated A. baumannii strains produced relatively similar biofilm amounts, with emphasis on the higher production of it in the Ab72 strain (Fig 2A). Tavaborole, at the concentration of 16 \u03bcg/ml, significantly reduced mature biofilm amount in Ab23 (100%), ATCC (89%) and Ab53 (76%) isolates, as well as slightly reduced it in Ab50 (50%) and Ab72 isolates (38%) (Fig 2B). A resazurin test was carried out to confirm viable bacteria reduction. Results have shown that this drug, at the concentration of 16 \u03bcg/ml, reduced ATCC (100%), Ab23 (100%), Ab50 (93%), Ab53 (94%), and Ab72 (59%) viabilities (Fig 2C).\n\n## Structural basis for tavaborole antimicrobial activity\nTavaborole was chosen for furth",
