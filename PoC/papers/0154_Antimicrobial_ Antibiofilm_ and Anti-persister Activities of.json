  "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus has increasingly attracted global attention as a major opportunistic human pathogen owing to the emergence of biofilms (BFs) and persisters that are known to increase its antibiotic resistance. However, there are still no effective antimicrobial agents in clinical settings. This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of penfluridol (PF), a long-acting antipsychotic drug, against S. aureus and its clinical isolates via drug repurposing. PF exhibited strong bactericidal activity against S. aureus, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 4-8 and 16-32 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. PF could significantly inhibit biofilm formation and eradicate 24 h preformed biofilms of S. aureus in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PF could effectively kill methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) persister cells and demonstrated considerable efficacy in a mouse model of subcutaneous abscess, skin wound infection, and acute peritonitis caused by MRSA. Notably, PF exerted almost no hemolysis activity on human erythrocytes, with limited cytotoxicity and low tendency to cause resistance. Additionally, PF induced bacterial membrane permeability and ATP release and further caused membrane disruption, which may be the underlying antibacterial mechanism of PF. In summary, our findings suggest that PF has the potential to serve as a novel antimicrobial agent against S. aureus biofilm- or persister-related infections.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nStaphylococcus aureus is an important opportunistic human pathogen that often causes disease in community and hospital settings (van Dalen et al., 2020). Staphylococcus aureus is both a frequent commensal and a leading cause of nosocomial infections, including bacteremia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and skin and soft tissue infections (Turner et al., 2019). With the widespread emergence of virulent and multidrug-resistant strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; Miller et al., 2020), there is an urgent and unmet clinical demand for a novel approach to cure these infections as the increasing antibiotic resistance is recognized as a major threat to global public health (Gandra et al., 2020).\nThe National Institutes of Health estimates that more than 80% of bacterial infections are accompanied by biofilm (BF) formation, with approximately 17 million new biofilm-related infections in the United States annually (Joseph et al., 2016). Infections caused by biofilm-related pathogens are difficult to eradicate as they can transition from acute stages to chronic stages, causing serious complications (Abraham, 2016). Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common pathogens of biofilm-related clinical infections, and can adhere to the surface of medical devices or human tissues to form biofilms (Arciola et al., 2018). Compared with planktonic bacteria, biofilm bacteria are much less susceptible to antibiotic and can evade the host\u2019s immune system, leading to a prolonged infection. The extracellular matrix of the biofilm prevents antimicrobial from reaching the bacteria embedded in a biofilm, greatly increasing drug resistance of bacteria in the biofilm. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new antimicrobial drugs to combat biofilm-associated infection, as it is proving difficult for traditional antibiotics to effectively eradicate the biofilms formed in the body (Koo et al., 2017).\nIn addition to the well-known strategies of antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation, bacterial colonies have an additional survival strategy that can endure harsh environment or antibiotic exposure. A small fraction of temporarily antibiotics-tolerant phenotypic mutants, known as persister cells, are capable of surviving from high dose of antibiotics treatment (Defraine et al., 2018). The presence of persisters can lead to recalcitrance and relapse of persistent bacterial infections, which further contribute to antimicrobial treatment failure (Fisher et al., 2017). Moreover, frontline MRSA treatments, including daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN), have been unable to eradicate persisters (Garrison et al., 2015), highlighting the urgency of novel antibacterial therapeutics to tackle chronic infections and improve the prognosis of patients.\nThe decrease in new antimicrobial candidates coupled with the increase in antibiotic resistance makes it necessary to develop alternative antibacterial drugs. Drug repurposing is a promising alternative strategy (Nosengo, 2016), the major theoretical basis for reusing approved drugs is that they are equipped with known modes of action, pharmacological analysis, and controllable side effects, thereby reducing the risks, time, and costs involved in developing new drugs. An example is the derivatives of thalidomide, originally designed to treat morning sickness, which have had remarkable clinical success in the therapeutic field well-beyond their original approved use (Mori et al., 2018; Schein, 2020). Evidently, drug repurposing has a broad prospect of clinical application, and more novel antimicrobials can be discovered through this strategy.\nPenfluridol (PF), an oral long-acting antipsychotic drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is used to treat chronic schizophrenia, acute psychosis, and Tourette\u2019s syndrome (Soares and Lima, 2006). The mechanism of PF action against psychotic disorders is thought to involve the blocking of dopamine receptors, especially to postsynaptic D2 receptor (Tuan and Lee, 2019). It has been demonstrated that PF exerts significant antibacterial and biofilm eradicating effects against Enterococcus faecalis (Zeng et al., 2021). However, its effects on persister cells, antibacterial mechanism and therapeutic efficacy in vivo against S. aureus have not been systematically studied. In this study, we conducted a detailed bioanalysis of PF as an antibacterial agent, including its mechanism of action and therapeutic efficiency in subcutaneous abscess infection, skin wound infection, and acute peritonitis models of MRSA infection.\n\n## Bacterial Isolates, Growth Conditions, and Reagents\nStaphylococcus aureus Newman, RJ-2, and ATCC 43300 were kindly provided by Li Min (Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China). The type strains including S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 1195, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 were kindly given by Juncai Luo (Tiandiren Biotech, Changsha, China). Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and RP62A were obtained from Qu Di (Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai, China). Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was supplied by Qiao Minqiang (College of Life Sciences of Nankai University, Tianjin, China). Other clinical isolates strains were obtained from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, China; She et al., 2020). Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus were cultured in soybean trypsin broth (TSB; Solarbio, Shanghai, China). Enterococcus faecalis strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth (Solarbio, Shanghai, China); other gram-negative strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Solarbio, Shanghai, China). All bacteria were grown at 37\u00b0C, with shaking at 180\u2013200 rpm. PF and other antibiotics were purchased from MedChem Express (New Jersey, United States).\n\n## Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of PF and other traditional antibiotics were determined by a broth microdilution method according to the recommendations of the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (Harbut et al., 2015). Briefly, drugs were 2-fold diluted in Mueller Hinton (MH) broth (Solarbio, Shanghai, China) and mixed with an equal volume of approximately 1.5 \u00d7 106 CFU/ml bacterial suspension into a microwell plate (Corning costar, United States) at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. MIC is defined as the lowest drug concentration with no visible bacterial growth. For the determination of the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC; Li et al., 2020), bacterial suspension (10 \u03bcl) was plated on blood agar plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. MBC is considered as the minimum concentration without visible bacterial colonies growth on the plate after incubating at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.\n\n## Killing Kinetics Assay\nStaphylococcus aureus was inoculated into TSB medium and cultured overnight at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm. The bacterial cultures were diluted with TSB medium containing PF at concentrations of 0.5\u20134\u00d7 MIC, to the final bacterial concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/ml; the bacterial culture was treated with 0.1% DMSO as a control. The suspensions were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 180 rpm, and samples, respectively were washed once with PBS, serially diluted, and plated on blood agar at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h. After incubating at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, the number of viable colonies was determined by plate counts (Thakare et al., 2017).\n\n## Drug Combination Assay\nBacterial suspension at mid-log phase was diluted and distributed into 96-well microplates, and a two-dimensional chessboard was established by adding serial dilutions of PF and other antibiotics horizontally and vertically, with a final volume of 100 \u03bcl per well. Results were determined at OD630 using a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, United States) after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 16\u201318 h. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated according to the following formula: FICI = MICA (combination)/MICA (alone) + MICB (combination)/MICB (alone). The FICI was judged as follows: FICI \u2264 0.5 indicates synergism; 0.5 < FICI \u2264 1 indicates additive; 1 < FICI \u2264 4 indicates irrelevant; and >4 indicates antagonism (MacNair et al., 2018).\n\n## Biofilm Inhibition and Eradication Assay\nStaphylococcus aureus cultured overnight was diluted 1:100 with fresh TSB culture medium, with or without antimicrobial agents, and 100 \u03bcl was added to a final drug concentration of 1\u2013128 \u03bcg/ml in a microplate. After incubating at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, planktonic cells were gently washed twice with saline. The biofilm biomass was quantified with crystal violet staining. Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of 0.25% crystal violet was added to each well. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, each well was washed using saline. Then, adding 100 \u03bcl 95% ethanol to dissolve stained dye for 20 min. The biofilm biomass was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer. For biofilm eradication assay, the 24-h biofilms were constructed as mentioned above, treated with 100 \u03bcl of the various antimicrobial agents at 37\u00b0C for another 24 h, and then washed with saline; the biofilm biomass was determined by the CV staining method (She et al., 2019a).\n\n## Biofilm-Forming Capacity\nThe 24 h biofilm was constructed in 96-well microplates as previously described; after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, biofilm biomass was measured by the CV staining method as described above, and the biofilm-forming ability was determined based on absorbance measured at 570 nm (A570nm). The biofilm-forming capacity was categorized according to the standard of Hassan et al. (2011), as follows: absorbance cut-off value (Ac) \u2264 A570nm \u2264 2 \u00d7 Ac indicates non/weak biofilm production; 2 \u00d7 Ac < A570nm \u2264 4 \u00d7 Ac indicates moderate biofilm production; and A570nm > 4 \u00d7 Ac indicates strong biofilm production, where Ac = average A570nm of negative control + 3 \u00d7 SD of negative control.\n\n## Determination of Viable Cells in Biofilm\nThe 24-h mature biofilm was established as previously described. Thereafter, 100 \u03bcl saline was added to destroy the biofilm and mixed by strong pipetting to assure separation from the well. Bacterial mixtures were subsequently transferred to a fresh microplate, continuously diluted 10-fold in saline, and viable bacteria were counted by a plate counting method (She et al., 2019b).\n\n## Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope Observation Analysis\nA confocal laser scanning microscope observation (CLSM) was used to visually evaluate the effect of PF in eradicating biofilm. The overnight culture of S. aureus was 1:100 diluted with fresh TSB medium, and 2 ml of S. aureus cultures were subsequently added to the six-well microwell plate (Corning/Costar, United States), the sterile glass sheet was placed into the well to form a 24-h biofilm. Thereafter, incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, the bacterial suspension was treated with 16 and 32 \u03bcg/ml PF, with no drug treatment or 64 \u03bcg/ml VAN as control. After incubation for 24 h, the mixture of SYTO9 and PI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China) was used to dye the biofilm. The glass slides were visualized by a CLSM (ZEISS LSM800, Jena, Germany), and the biofilm biomass was quantified with ImageJ software (Liu et al., 2015).\n\n## Persister Killing Assay\nPersisters of S. aureus strains were prepared by culturing overnight to stationary phase at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 200 rpm (Kim et al., 2018). Overnight culture was washed three times with PBS and adjusted to OD630 = 0.2; then 2\u20138\u00d7 MIC PF (8\u00d7 MIC VAN as control) was added to 2 ml of the persister cell suspension and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 200 rpm. Samples were washed and harvested, respectively, at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h, and the total number of colonies was determined by plate count.\n\n## Persister Membrane Permeability Assay\nPersisters were obtained following a previous protocol (Kim et al., 2019); persister cells were washed three times and adjusted to OD630 = 0.4 with PBS. SYTOX Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) was added to 5 ml of this bacterial suspension to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM and incubated in the dark for 30 min. The bacterial/SYTOX Green suspension (50 \u03bcl) was mixed with 50 \u03bcl of desired concentration of PF in black, clear-bottom microplates (Corning, United States). Fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer EnVision, United States) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 525 nm, respectively.\n\n## Biofilm Persisters Killing Assay\nTo obtain persister cells from the biofilm, a mid-logarithmic phase culture of MRSA was diluted to 1 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml in BHI broth. Diluted bacterial suspension (100 \u03bcl) was added to the 96-well plate, and the plate was sealed and incubated in a humid atmosphere at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The plate was washed twice to remove planktonic bacteria, and biofilm was exposed to 100 \u03bcl BHI medium containing 100\u00d7 MIC rifampin (RFP). After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, planktonic bacteria were removed, and any residual bacteria attached to the well were transferred into 100 \u03bcl saline by 5 min sonication. Bacteria were then treated with 200 \u03bcl of saline containing 2, 4, and 8\u00d7 MIC PF. Bacteria were exposed to saline without antibiotics or with 64 \u03bcg/ml VAN, which served as a control. The number of live bacteria in biofilm was determined at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h by plate count (de Breij et al., 2018).\n\n## Drug Resistance Screening\nThe drug resistance of S. aureus to PF was evaluated by single-step drug resistance and sequential passaging resistance. For single-step frequency of resistance, overnight cultures of S. aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 43300 were adjusted to OD630 = 0.5 with TSB medium. Bacterial suspensions (100 \u03bcl) were subsequently spread on pre-prepared MH agar containing 2 and 4\u00d7 MIC of RFP, ciprofloxacin (CIP), and PF; after 48 h of incubation, the drug spontaneous resistance frequency was defined as the number of resistant colonies divided by the initial viable cell count (Qu et al., 2020). For sequential passaging resistance, the MICs of PF and CIP against S. aureus were determined on the first day. After incubating for 16 h, bacterial suspension (5 \u03bcl) was taken from the well, with an antibiotic concentration of 0.5\u00d7 MIC, and then diluted 1,000-fold with MH broth. Bacterial suspensions (50 \u03bcl) and 50 \u03bcl of diluted drugs were added to a 96-well plate, and the MIC was determined the next day. The scheme was successively performed for 25 days (Friedman et al., 2006).\n\n## Membrane Permeability Assay\nStaphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 43300 were grown to mid-log growth phase, washed, and suspended in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), and OD630 was adjusted to 0.05. SYTOX Green fluorescence dye was added to bacterial suspension to a final concentration of 2 \u03bcM, and then treated with various concentrations of PF. The intensity of fluorescence was measured for 20 min with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 525 nm, respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).\n\n## Membrane Depolarization Assay\nStaphylococcus aureus in the mid-log growth phase was washed and suspended in 5 mM HEPES, adjusted at OD630 to 0.05, incubated with 100 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose, and 2 \u03bcM Disc 3(5) (AAT Bioquest, United States) at room temperature in the dark atmosphere for 1 h, and serially diluted with PF to monitor the fluorescence intensity every 30 s for a total of 5 min. The excitation and emission wavelengths were at 622 and 670 nm, respectively. Melittin (10 \u03bcg/ml) and 0.1% DMSO were served as a positive and negative controls, respectively (Zhou et al., 2020).\n\n## Total Reactive Oxygen Species Measurement\nROS levels in S. aureus ATCC 433300 treated by PF were detected with 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Beyotime, Shanghai). Briefly, S. aureus was grown overnight at 37\u00b0C and 200 rpm, and then washed and suspended in 1\u00d7 PBS with OD630 of 0.5. The bacterial suspension was incubated with DCFH-DA at a final concentration of 10 \u03bcmol/L for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS, 190 \u03bcl of bacterial cells labeled with probe and 10 \u03bcl of PF were then added to a microwell plate and incubated for another 30 min. The fluorescence intensity was immediately detected by a microplate reader at excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm (Song et al., 2020).\n\n## Measurement of ATP Release\nIntracellular and extracellular ATP levels of S. aureus were measured by an Enhanced ATP Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). S. aureus ATCC 43300, cultured overnight, was washed and suspended with PBS to gain an OD630 of 0.5. After treatment with different concentrations of PF (0\u201316 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 h, the bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C for 5 min; thereafter, the supernatant was harvested to measure the level of extracellular ATP. In addition, the bacterial sediments were cleaved by lysozyme and harvested the supernatant to determine the level of intracellular ATP. The supernatant was dispensed into the microplate and incubated for 5 min before recording luminescence intensity using the microplate reader (Liu et al., 2020).\n\n## NPN Uptake Assay\nN-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) uptake assay was conducted to investigate membrane permeability. S. aureus ATCC 433300 was diluted to 2 \u00d7 106 CFU/ml, and then NPN was added to the final concentration of 20 \u03bcM, followed by incubation with different concentrations of PF for 15 min. Triton X-100 (0.1%) was used as a positive control. The fluorescence intensity was recorded (excitation wavelength 340 nm; emission wavelength 405 nm) using the microplate reader (PerkinElmer EnVision, United States) to evaluate the uptake of NPN (Elliott et al., 2020).\n\n## Bacterial Viability Assay\nDead bacteria induced by PF were assessed with Live/Dead BacLight bacterial viability kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China). Overnight bacterial culture of S. aureus ATCC 43300 was washed twice, suspended in 1\u00d7 PBS, and adjusted to OD630 of 0.1. Bacterial suspension was treated with serially diluted PF (0, 4, 8, and 16 \u03bcg/ml) and incubated for 1 h. The bacterial cells were washed, collected, and suspended in 1\u00d7 PBS. SYTO9 (3.34 mmol/L, 0.75 \u03bcl) and PI (20 mmol/L, 0.75 \u03bcl) mixture were added to each sample and incubated for 15 min. Thereafter, fluorescence images were obtained using a CLSM, and the percentage of red and green fluorescent particles was determined by ImageJ software (Song et al., 2020).\n\n## Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy\nStaphylococcus aureus was cultured to mid-log growth phase at 37\u00b0C, 180 rpm, suspended in PBS, and treated with PF of 8\u00d7 MIC for 1 h; bacteria without drug treatment served as controls. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min and observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan; She et al., 2020).\n\n## RNA Sequencing\nGene expression levels in S. aureus ATCC 43300 were detected by treatment with PF or 0.1% DMSO. Samples were harvested 1 h post-treatment and were independently prepared for RNA sequencing. E.Z.N.A Total RNA Kit II was used to extract the total RNA, and subsequent transcriptomic analysis was performed by the Shanghai Applied Protein Technology (Shanghai, China).\n\n## Hemolysis Assays and Cytotoxicity\nHuman red blood cells were purchased from the Hemo Pharmaceutical & Biological Co (Shanghai, China), and centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and washed twice with saline. About 100 \u03bcl red blood cell (RBC) suspension and 100 \u03bcl different concentrations of PF were added to the microplate to a final RBC concentration of 4%. RBC suspensions were treated, with 0.2% DMSO and 0.1% Triton X-100, used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 1 h of incubation, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 570 nm (A570), hemolysis rate was calculated as follows (Tan et al., 2019):\nThe CCK-8 kit (Tongren, Japan) was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of PF on human bronchial epithelial cell line HBE, human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, and human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC). HBE, A549, and HBMEC cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium with 10% FBS (Gibco). Then, 100 \u03bcl of log-phase cells was added to a 96-well plate with a final concentration of 5 \u00d7 103 cells/well and then incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h to make cells adhere. The cells were then exposed to different concentrations of PF or 0.1% DMSO included as control. After incubation under normal tissue culture conditions for 8 h, the cell viability was detected with CCK-8 kit following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n## Pharmacokinetic Analysis\nA single dose of 10 mg/kg PF was administered to ICR female mice by subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or tail intravenous injection (n = 4, mice per group). Plasma samples were collected from the three groups at different time points (5, 15, and 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h). The concentration of PF in mice plasma was detected by LC\u2013MS, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonlin 7.0.\n\n## Murine Subcutaneous Abscess Model\nSpecific pathogen-free ICR female mice (Hunan, China), aged 8 weeks and weighing 24\u201326 g were used. Mice were anesthetized with 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital via intraperitoneal injection, and the dorsal hair was removed with an electric razor. Prior to injection, S. aureus ATCC 433300 cells were washed and resuspended in saline. A 50 \u03bcl bacterial suspension containing 1 \u00d7 107 CFU cells was subcutaneously injected into the dorsum. One hour after infection, 100 \u03bcl PF (5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) was directly injected subcutaneously into the infected site. The vehicle (0.5% DMSO) was applied as a negative control and 10 mg/kg VAN as a positive control. After treatment for 2 days, mice were euthanized through cervical dislocation and the size of abscess was measured; the skin was excised and homogenized with saline. The number of viable cells was counted (Pletzer et al., 2018).\n\n## Skin Wound Infection Model\nNon-specific pathogen BALB/c female mice (Hunan, China), aged 6 weeks and weighing 16\u201318 g were used, and a bacterial suspension of 108 CFU/ml of S. aureus ATCC 433300 was prepared. Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital by intraperitoneal injection. Mouse backs were shaved off with electric razors and anesthetized, and then sterile needles were used to create a wound with an area of approximately 2 cm2. S. aureus suspension (50 \u03bcl) was then loaded onto the wounded skin. Approximately 2 h after infection, Glaxal Base Moisturizing Cream containing 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0% PF was applied to the skin. Meanwhile, the vehicle (1.0% DMSO) was applied to the skin as a control and 1.0% VAN prepared ointment was used in the positive control group. After treatment for 24 h, mice were euthanized, the skin excised, and homogenized with saline. The number of viable bacteria was counted by plate counting method. Infected skin wound tissues were preserved in 4% formalin (Sangon), sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin (HE) for histopathological analysis. The skin of MRSA-infected mice was homogenized and centrifuged, and the supernatant was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis. The level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was quantitatively detected with an ELISA kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thangamani et al., 2016).\n\n## Mouse Acute Peritonitis Infection Model\nTo determine the toxicity in vivo, female ICR mice (n = 5) were injected intraperitoneally with 20, 40, 60, and 100 mg/kg PF. Survival rates of treated mice were recorded during 7 days. The mouse acute peritonitis model was generated as described previously (Su et al., 2019), with minor modifications. Briefly, S. aureus USA300 was washed and resuspended in saline, and prepared to a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 CFU/ml containing 5% mucoprotein (Cool Chemistry, Beijing, China) for subsequent use. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 \u03bcl of the prepared bacterial suspension. Thereafter, groups of mice (n = 6) were intraperitoneally administered, at 1 and 12 h after infection, with 20 mg/kg PF, 20 mg/kg VAN, or saline with 0.6% DMSO, the latter two acting as a positive control or vehicle group, respectively. After infection for 24 h, mice were euthanized, and their liver, kidney, and spleen were excised, homogenized, serially diluted, and then the bacterial load was determined.\n\n## Statistical Analyses\nAll experiments were performed with three biological replicates. GraphPad Prism (version 8.0) was used for statistical analysis. Unless otherwise noted, value of p were calculated using Student\u2019s t-test for two group comparisons or one-way ANOVA for comparisons among multiple groups. Value of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; and ****p < 0.0001.\n\n## Antimicrobial Effects of PF Against \nPenfluridol exhibited strong antibacterial activities against type and clinical strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis, with an MIC and MBC of 4\u20138 and 16\u201332 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Similarly, we chose VAN and DAP as control to compare their antibacterial activity, because they are first-line antibiotics in the treatment of S. aureus-associated infection. The MICs of VAN and DAP against types and clinical strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and S. epidermidis were 1\u20134 and 0.5\u20138 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The MBCs against S. aureus, E. faecalis, and S. epidermidis were 1\u201316 and 2\u201332 \u03bcg/ml for VAN and DAP, respectively. No antibacterial activities were observed for PF, VAN, and DAP against Gram-negative bacteria, including K. pneumoniae and E. coli with MICs >128 \u03bcg/ml (Table 1).\nThe chemical structural formula of PF was presented in the Figure 1A, the MIC of PF against S. aureus ATCC 43300 was 8 \u03bcg/ml (Figure 1B). To study whether the bactericidal effect of PF against MRSA ATCC 43300 was in a dose- and time-dependent manner, a time killing curve was generated (Figure 1C). Strong bactericidal effect was observed with PF concentrations at 1\u00d7 MIC, and decreased bacterial cell counts from 6 to 2.6-log10 CFU/ml after treatment for 6 h. In addition, PF could rapidly kill all viable bacteria after treatment with 4 and 2\u00d7 MIC for 2 and 8 h, respectively.\nCheckerboard combination assay was conducted to investigate the effect of PF combined with several antibiotics against S. aureus ATCC 43300; results showed that, when combined with tetracycline (TC), the MIC of PF reduced from 8 to 2 \u03bcg/ml, while that of TC decreased from 2 to 0.5 \u03bcg/ml (Supplementary Figure 1A). Combined with 64 \u03bcg/ml polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), the MIC of PF decreased by 4-fold, from 8 to 2 \u03bcg/ml (Supplementary Figure 1B). In addition, when PF was combined with fosfomycin (FOS), ceftriaxone (CRO), or levofloxacin (LEV), FICI was greater than 0.5, indicating an additive effect (Supplementary Figures 1C\u2013E). The MIC of gentamicin (GN) did not decrease when combined with PF, and the FICI was calculated as >1, which was an irrelevant effect (Supplementary Figure 1F; Supplementary Table 1).\n\n## Resistance Development Evaluation of PF to \nThe results of sequential passaging resistance are demonstrated in Figures 1D,E. Serial passage of S. aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 43300 in existence of 0.5\u00d7 MIC PF over a period of 25 days failed to produce drug resistance mutations as well, whereas the relative MIC values of CIP increased by 32 and 16-fold, respectively. With regard to single-step resistance evolution, the spontaneous resistance frequencies of PF were far below than that of CIP and RFP (Table 2). The spontaneous resistance frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 43300 treated with 4\u00d7 MIC PF were 4.16 \u00d7 10\u221210 (\u00b17.21 \u00d7 10\u221210) and 8.77 \u00d7 10\u221210 (\u00b11.52 \u00d7 10\u22129), respectively, while treatment with 4\u00d7 MIC RFP yielded 6.67 \u00d7 10\u22129 (\u00b11.91 \u00d7 10\u22129) and 2.10 \u00d7 10\u22128 (\u00b15.25 \u00d7 10\u22129) frequencies, respectively. These results suggested that regardless of the short-term or long-term evolution of resistance, PF was better than RFP and CIP in reducing drug resistance mutations.\n\n## Biofilm Formation Inhibition and Eradication Effects of PF Against \nThe biofilm-forming ability of S. aureus (including MSSA and MRSA strains) is presented in Supplementary Table 2; four strains with strong biofilm formation capacity were picked for the biofilm eradication assay. PF could dose-dependently inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation when the concentration was \u22650.5 \u03bcg/ml. In addition, PF (p < 0.001) showed stronger inhibitory effects on biofilm formation than VAN at 0.5 \u03bcg/ml concentration (Supplementary Figures 2A,B). Similarly, PF demonstrated an effective biofilm-eradicating effect against four strains of S. aureus in a dose-dependent fashion (Figures 2A\u2013D), in contrast to VAN, which could not eradicate biofilm (p > 0.05; Supplementary Figure 2C). The CLSM images also showed that 16 and 32 \u03bcg/ml PF exerted more significant biofilm eradication activities compared with 64 \u03bcg/ml VAN, with the green fluorescence signal intensity of viable bacteria markedly decreased and the density and thickness of biofilm significantly weakened (Figure 2E), as validated by the results of fluorescence intensity quantitative analysis (Figure 2F). The results of live bacteria count showed that, in contrast to the control, the number of live bacteria in the biofilm was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent fashion after treatment with PF (Figure 2G).\n\n## PF Shows Bactericidal Activity Against MRSA Persister Cells\nFour strains of MRSA with strong biofilm-forming capacity were used for the killing assay of persister cells. PF with 8\u00d7 MIC could kill 4\u20136 log10 of persister cells, more effective than the 8-fold MIC of VAN (Figure 3A). For example, for the MRSA strain RJ2, the PF treatment of 4\u00d7 MIC reduced the number of persister cells by 2.13 log10, 8\u00d7 MIC PF decreased the cell number by 6.58 log10, whereas treatment with 8",
