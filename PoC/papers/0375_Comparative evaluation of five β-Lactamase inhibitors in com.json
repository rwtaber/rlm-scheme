  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evaluating the activity of six \u03b2-lactams in combination with different \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors to identify the most potent combination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) in vitro. METHODS: A total of 105 MDR-TB strains from different regions of Henan province were included in this study.Drug susceptibility of six\u03b2-lactams alone or in combination with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors was examined by broth dilution method against 105 clinical isolates.Mutations of blaC, ldtmt1,dacB2and ldtmt2 were analyzed by PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Out of the \u03b2-lactams used herein, tebipenem was the most effective against MDR-TB and had an MIC90 value of 16\u00a0\u00b5g/ml.Clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam, demonstrated the best synergy with tebipenem, resultingin an 32-fold reduction in theMIC values for 12, 5, and 20 strains, respectively. Simultaneously, these three types of\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors had the least impact on imipenem.Clavulanic acid caused the maximum 8-fold reduction in the MIC value of imipenem, while tazobactam and sulbactam only resulted in the maximum 4-fold reduction in the MIC value of imipenem. Besides, after the addition of\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, the MICs of most \u03b2-lactam drugs were reduced more evidently in the presence of avibactamand tazobactamcompared to other \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. In addition, 13.33% (14/105) of isolates harbored mutations in the blaC gene, with three different nucleotide substitutions: AGT333AGG \u3001AAC638ACCand ATC786ATT. For the strains with a Ser111Arg andAsn213Thrsubstitution inBlaC, a better synergistic effect was observed in the meropenem-clavulanate and in the meropenem-sulbactam combinationsthan that in a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) group. CONCLUSION: the combination of tebipenem and relebactam shows the most potent activity against MDR-TB isolates. In addition, the Ser111Arg and Asn213Thr substitution of BlaC may be associated with increased susceptibility of MDR-TB isolates to meropenem in thepresence of clavulanate and sulbactam.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nIn recent years, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, namely the M. tuberculosis resistant to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, has become a major obstacle to global tuberculosis control [1, 2]. According to the estimation of the World Health Organization (WHO), there are about 465,000 patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis worldwide, among whom 78% have MDR tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Only one-third of the MDR-TB patients have received appropriate treatment [3]. MDR bacteria are resistant to the two most important anti-TB drugs, rifampicin and isoniazid, which increase the risk of treatment failure in MDR patients.The extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), a type of MDR-TB resistant to fluoroquinolone drugs and at least one drug of bedaquiline and linezolid, has an even lower treatment success rate [4, 5]. The increase in the number of MDR-TB patients has made it difficult for the traditional first- and second-line anti-TB drugs to meet the needs for drug-resistant TBtreatment. Novel and effective treatment strategies are urgently needed to overcome the shortcomings of the current treatment regimens, especially for XDR-TB [6\u20138].\n\u03b2-Lactam drugs impede the synthesis of bacterial cell wall by inhibiting the cross-linking reaction of peptidoglycans (PGs), thus exerting a potent bactericidal activity [9, 10]. M. tuberculosis is naturally resistant to most \u03b2-lactam drugs dues to its highly active \u03b2-lactamase BlaC [11, 12]. BlaC is a class A lactamase in the Ambler molecular structure classification. It can be inactivated by most commercial \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors [13].Therefore, the combined application of \u03b2-lactams and lactamase inhibitors can overcome the resistance of M. tuberculosis to \u03b2-lactams. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the combined application of \u03b2-lactams and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors effectively kills M. tuberculosis [14\u201316]. In addition, some clinical trialshave evaluated carbapenem efficacy, safety, and tolerance in M. tuberculosis patients. The combined applicationof amoxicillin and clavulanic acid effectively inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosisin vitro and exhibits antibacterial activity in the early anti-tuberculosis treatment of MDR-TB. In macrophages infected by M. tuberculosis, combined administration of imipenem and clavulanic acid for 1 week reduces the bacterial load by more than 50% [17]. Meropenem exhibits good antibacterial activity in MDR patients with a risk of treatment failure [18, 19]. Meropenem and clavulanic acid have strongbactericidal activity against M. tuberculosis in MDR-TB and XDR-TB.Because oftheir potent antibacterial activity [20], imipenem and meropenem have been classified by the WHO as group C anti-TB drugs forthe treatment of patients with MDR-TBor rifampicin-resistant TB [21\u201323].\nBlaC exhibits broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against penicillins and cephalosporins, while having weaker activity against the new carbapenems. Compared with penicillin and cephalosporin, the combination of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors and carbapenems has greater antibacterial activity against MDR-TB strains [24].Several clinical trials provided preliminary evidence of the efficacy and safety of meropenem and clavulanic acid in the treatment of MDR and XDR patients [25].The potent antibacterial activity of meropenem and clavulanic acid suggests that other combinations of \u03b2-lactams and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors might besuitable for the clinical treatment of MDR and XDR patients.\nAvibactam and relebactam are two new carbapenem \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. Avibactam is a structural inhibitor. Although it does not contain a \u03b2-lactam core, it induces\u03b2-lactamases to undergo covalent acylation. As a covalent \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam has a inhibitory effect on \u03b2-lactamase activity [26]. Relebactam is a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor structurally similar to avibactam, but the activity of this drug against MDR-TBhas beenless thoroughly evaluated [27]. In this study, we selected six \u03b2-lactams and five \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, including the two new \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors avibactam and relebactam. We then used the broth dilution method to evaluate the bactericidal activities of \u03b2-lactams alone and the combination of \u03b2-lactams and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors against MDR-TB strains in vitro. This study provides more potential \u03b2-lactam and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor candidates for the clinical treatment of patients with MDR TB.\n\n## Strains and drug susceptibility test\nThe 105 MDR clinicalstrains included in this study were isolated from culture-positive TB patients in six municipal TB control institutions of Henan province in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Nanyang, Luoyang, Anyang, and Zhoukou.These strains were preserved in the Strain Bank of the Institute for the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases, Henan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention.All experiments were conducted in the TB reference laboratory of Henan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention.This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Henan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention(Number: 2023-KY-002-02).\nThe positive strains cultured on acidic Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) media were subjected to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, and ofloxacinsusceptibility tests using the proportions method recommended by WHO [28].In addition, the strains were subjected to mycobacterial species identification using LJ media supplemented withp-nitrobenzoic acid (PNB) and 2-thiophene carboxylic acid hydrazide (TCH).\n\n## Different carbapenem-class \u03b2-lactam drugs and \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors\nThe present study used six lactam drugs and five \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The six\u03b2-lactam drugs were all carbapenems, including five injection drugs commonly used in clinical practice (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem, and biapenem) and a novel oral drug, tebipenem. The five \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors included three clinically commonly used inhibitors(clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam) and two newer inhibitors (avibactam and relebactam). This study evaluatedthe synergistic effect of these \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors with the \u03b2-lactam drugs against MDR strains. Imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem, biapenem, tebipenem, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, sulbactam, and avibactam were purchased from APExbio (USA). Relebactam was purchased from the MEK company (USA).\n\n## Determination of the mics\nThe MICs of the \u03b2-lactam drugs against clinical MDR strains were determined using the microplate Alamar blue assay [29]. Briefly, 100\u00a0\u00b5l of 7H9 liquid medium containing various concentrations of \u03b2-lactamdrugs and\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors were added to the wells of 96-well plates. The\u03b2-lactam drugs were serially diluted from one column to the next, until the penultimate column of sample wells had a concentration of 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. No\u03b2-lactam drugs were added in the last well to act as blank control. Colonies cultured on LJ medium for 4 weeks were scraped off and transferred to normal saline containing 0.5% Tween-20. The turbidity of the bacterial suspension was adjusted to 1 McFarland concentration.Then this bacterial suspension was diluted 20-fold with Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium containing 10% OADC medium, and 100\u00a0\u00b5l of the diluted bacterial suspension was added to the wells of 96-well plates containing various drug combinations. The final concentrations of the \u03b2-lactam drugs were 0.5\u2013512\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. After 7 days of cultivation,20\u00a0\u00b5l Alamar Blue was added to microplate wells and reincubatedovernight until a colour change occurred. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited the growth of the bacteria.MIC50 refers to the drug concentration that inhibits the growth of 50% among105Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.In other words, at this concentration, 50% of the experimental samples no longer exhibited growth.MIC90 denotes the drug concentration that inhibits the growth of 90% of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains within the same cohort of 105 strains. This indicated that 90% of the experimental samples didnot show growth at this concentration.\n\n## Genomic DNA extraction and sequencing\nGenomic DNA was extracted from M. tuberculosis using the boiling method reported in the literature [30]. Freshly cultured colonies were scraped into 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes containing 200\u00a0\u00b5l of TE buffer, boiled at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min [31], and centrifuged at 13,000g for 5\u00a0min to remove sample residues. The DNA-containing supernatants were subjected topolymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing.\nThree genes, blaC, dacB2, and ldtMt1, were subjected toPCR amplification [32]. The sequences of the amplification primers were as follows: blaC: 3\u2032-ATGCGCAACAG.\nAGGATTCGGTC-5\u2032;blaC:5\u2032-CTATGCAAGCACACCGGCAACG-3\u2032;dacB2:3\u2032-ACCAGCAACTGCTGGATTTC-5\u2032;dacB2:5\u2032-ACCAGCAACTGCTGGATTTC-3\u2032;ldtMt15\u2032-:ATGCGTCGAGTGGTTCGTTATC-3\u2032;ldtMt1: 3\u2032-ATGCCAAAGGTGGGGATTGC-5\u2032. PCR amplification was performed in a 25-\u00b5l reaction system using the extracted genomic DNA as atemplate. The 25 \u00b5L PCR mixture was prepared as follows: 12.5\u00a0\u00b5l 2\u00d7 PCR mixture(CWBIO Biotech Company, China), 5 \u00b5L of DNA template, and 0.2 \u00b5M of each upstream and downstream primer. The PCR conditions for amplification were 5\u00a0min at 94\u00a0\u00b0C followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min, 58\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0min, 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 45s, and a final extension of 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. PCR products were sent to Shanghai Sangon Biotech Company for Sanger sequencing. The PCR products were sent forSanger sequencing at Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China. The sequencing results were compared with the reference sequence of the standard strain H37Rv to identify mutation sites using DNAMAN software.\n\n## Data analysis\nThe synergistic effect is declared when the ratio of MIC without beta-lactamase inhibitor to MIC with beta-lactamase inhibitor is more than 4 times.Chi-square tests were performed using SPSS 20.0 software for the comparison of count data.A p-value of 0.05 or lower is generally considered statistically significant.The synergistic effect of different \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors on the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values of \u03b2-lactams was analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software.\n\n## Determination of the optimal inhibitory concentrations of various \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors\nTo determine the optimal inhibitory concentrations of various \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, we first evaluated the MICs of different \u03b2-lactams against five MDR strains when used alone and the improvement in these MICs in the presence of concentration gradients of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0\u00b5g/ml). As shown in Table\u00a01, with the increase in the concentration of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, the MICs of biapenem, doripenem, and tebipenem decreased significantly against the MDR strains. \u03b2-lactam inhibitors also improved the MICs of meropenem, imipenem, and ertapenem against the MDR strains. In most cases, the MICs were reduced by 4-8-fold. Overall, there was little difference in the MICs of \u03b2-lactamase drugs between the two groups with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor concentrations of 5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml and 10\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. In light of these results, a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor concentration of5 \u00b5g/ml was used in later experiments.\nTable 1Antibacterial activity of different combinations of six \u03b2-lactams and five \u03b2-lactamaseinhibitors against five multidrug-resistant clinical strainsrange of MIC values after combined use of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitorsclavulanic acid(\u00b5g/ml)tazobactam(\u00b5g/ml)sulbactam(\u00b5g/ml)01.252.551001.252.551001.252.5510Biapemem16\u2013648\u2013324\u2013322\u2013162\u20131616\u2013648\u2013324\u2013322\u2013162\u20131616\u2013644\u2013322\u2013161\u201380.5-8Meropenem32\u201312816\u2013648\u2013644\u2013324\u20133232\u201312832\u201312816\u2013648\u2013648\u20136432\u201312816\u2013648\u2013642\u2013162\u201316Imipenem64,51232\u20136416\u2013324\u2013164\u20131664\u201351264\u201351264\u201325632\u201312832\u201312864\u201351264\u201351264\u201325632\u201312832\u2013128Doripenem16\u20136416\u2013328\u2013320.5-80.5-816\u2013648\u2013324\u2013162\u2013162\u20131616\u2013648\u2013322\u2013160.5-40.5-4Ertapenem32\u201312832\u20136416\u2013324\u2013324\u20133232\u201312832\u201312816\u2013648\u2013648\u20136432\u201312832\u201312816\u2013644\u2013644\u201332Tebipenem4\u2013162\u201381\u201340.5-20.5-24\u2013162\u2013162\u201380.5-40.5-44\u2013162\u201381\u201340.5-10.5-1range of MIC values after combined use of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitorsavibactam(\u00b5g/ml)relebactam(\u00b5g/ml)01.252.551001.252.5510Biapemem16\u2013644\u2013162\u201380.5-80.5-816\u2013644\u2013322\u2013160.5-80.5-8Meropenem32\u201312816\u20131288\u2013644\u2013324\u20133232\u201312816\u20131284\u2013642\u2013322\u201332Imipenem64\u201351232\u201351216\u20135128-2568-25664\u201351232\u201351216\u20135128-2568-256Doripenem16\u2013648\u2013322\u2013160.5-80.5-816\u2013648\u2013324\u2013160.5-80.5-4Ertapenem32\u201312816\u20131288\u2013642\u2013322\u20133232\u201312816\u20131284\u2013641\u2013321\u201332Tebipenem4\u2013162\u201381\u201340.5-10.5-14\u2013161\u201340.5-10.50.5\n\n## Sensitivity of MDR strains to \u03b2-lactam drugs when administered in combination with clavulanic acid\nA total of 105 MDR strains were included in this study. We first evaluated the MICs of the \u03b2-lactam drugs against the MDR strains without any \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors.The results showed that among the six lactamase drugs used in this study, tebipenem exhibited the best antibacterial activity against MDR-TB strains(\u03c72\u2009=\u2009123.70, p\u2009<\u20090.001), followed by doripenem and biapenem. The MIC50 and MIC90 values of tebipenem were 8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml and 16\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, respectively. The MIC90 values of doripenem and biapenem were both 64\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. Compared with biapenem, doripenem showed better antibacterial activity. The MIC50 values of doripenem and biapenem were 16 and 32\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, respectively. Imipenem had the worst antibacterial activity, with the MIC50 and MIC90 values of 128\u00a0\u00b5g/ml and 512\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, respectively.\nWe then examined the effect of theaddition of clavulanate on the MICs of lactam drugs and further analyzed the improvement of the MICs of the lactam drugs by clavulanate. As shown in Table\u00a02, tebipenem showed the best synergistic effect with clavulanate. The MICs of tebipenem were reduced by 32- and 16-fold, respectively, against 12 (15.23%) and 22 (24.76%) strains. The MIC50 and MIC90 values of tebipenem were 2\u00a0\u00b5g/ml and 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, respectively. Doripenem and biapenem also showed a good synergistic effect with clavulanic acid. In contrast, clavulanic acid appeared to have the least effect on the MICs of imipenem and ertapenem against MDR-TB strains, both of which had a MIC90 of 128\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. The presence of clavulanic acid reduced the MICs of imipenem by 4-fold at most. However, compared with the other 4 lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid had the best synergistic effect with imipenem. It reduced the MIC50 and MIC90 values ofimipenem by 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively.Moreover, the MICs of imipenem were reduced by 8-fold against 8 strains (7.6%) and 4-fold against 28 strains (26.67%).\nTable 2Effect of 5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml clavulanic acid on the mics of \u03b2-lactam drugsMIC50MIC90The range of MIC decrease multiplesMIC range (\u00b5g/ml)MICDistribution widthSDofMIC-+-+Biapemem321664321\u2013322\u201364646.36Meropenem3216128641\u2013164-128649.27Imipenem128645121281\u201384-1286107.89Doripenem16864161\u201332\u2264\u20090.5\u201332\u2265\u2009717.67Ertapenem64321281281\u2013164-128670.91Tebipenem80.51621\u201332\u2264\u20090.5-8\u2265\u200952.90\n\n## Sensitivity to \u03b2-lactam drugs when administered in combination with Tazobactam\nAmong the three \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, tazobactam showed the worst synergistic effect (Table\u00a03). Compared with other inhibitors, the combined application of tazobactam and\u03b2-lactam drugs resulted in higher MIC50 values. After the addition of tazobactam, tebipenem showed the most significant change in the MIC against the MDR strains of all the \u03b2-lactam drugs. This result was similar to that of clavulanic acid. Compared with tebipenem alone, the combined application of tebipenem and tazobactam reduced the MICs by more than 4-fold in 88 MDR-TB strains.The MIC50 value of tebipenem against the MDR strains was decreased from 8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml to 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, indicating that tebipenem and tazobactam had a good synergistic effect.However, supplementation withtazobactam had little effect on the MICs of meropenem and imipenem against the MDR-TB strains. Specifically, the MIC values remained unchanged against 42 and 65 strains, respectively.\nTable 3Effect of 5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml Tazobactam on the MIC of \u03b2-lactam drugsMIC50MIC90The range of MIC decrease multiplesMIC range (\u00b5g/ml)MICDistribution widthSD of MIC-+-+Biapemem321664321\u2013322\u201364650.95Meropenem32161281281\u201388-2566115.41Imipenem1281285125121\u2013432\u20135125205.38Doripenem16864321\u2013322\u201364646.62Ertapenem64641281281\u201388-2566100.69Tebipenem80.51641\u201332\u2264\u20090.5\u201316\u2265\u200965.82\n\n## Sensitivity to \u03b2-lactam drugs when administeredin combination with sulbactam\nSulbactam showed a good synergistic effect with four of the six \u03b2-lactam drugs (biapenem, meropenem, doripenem, and tebipenem).Sulbactam reduced the MIC50 values of these four drugs to below 8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. Moreover, the MIC50 or MIC90 values of the four drugs in the presence of sulbactam were lower than those in the presence of clavulanic acid and tazobactam. In particular, sulbactam showed the best synergistic effect with tebipenem. Sulbactam reduced the MICs of tebipenem by 32-fold against 18 strains and 16-fold against 38 strains (Table\u00a04). The addition of sulbactam reduced MIC50 and MIC90 values of tebipenem by 16-fold against the MDR strains. It reduced the MIC50 of tebipenem from 8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml to 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, while it reduced the MIC90 from 16\u00a0\u00b5g/ml to 1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. In addition, sulbactam had a good synergistic effect with doripenem and biapenem. It reduced the MICs of doripenem and biapenem by more than 16-fold in 27 (25.71%) and 17 (16.19%) strains, respectively. Like the other two inhibitors, sulbactam showed the least synergistic effect with imipenem. Sulbactam reduced the MICs of imipenem by 4-fold at most.\nTable 4Effect of 5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml sulbactam on the mics of \u03b2-lactam drugsMIC50MIC90The range of MIC decrease multiplesMIC range (\u00b5g/ml)MICDistribution widthSD of MIC-+-+Biapemem32864161\u2013321\u201364720.36Meropenem328128321\u201362\u201364636.59Imipenem128645125121\u2013432\u20135125206.00Doripenem16464161\u201332\u2264\u20090.5\u201364\u2265\u2009812.38Ertapenem64321281281\u2013164-128671.72Tebipenem80.51621\u201332\u2264\u20090.5\u201316\u2265\u200962.07\n\n## Sensitivity to \u03b2-lactam drugs when applied in combination with avibactam\nWe then evaluated the synergistic effect of avibactam with the lactam drugs. Compared with clavulanic acid, avibactam had a superior synergistic effect with fourof the six \u03b2-lactam drugs (biapenem, meropenem, doripenem, and tebipenem). Avibactam reduced the MIC50 values of the 4 drugs to below 8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml.The MIC50and MIC90values of the four drugs were lower in the presence of avibactam than they werein the presence of clavulanic acid. After the addition of avibactam, tebipenem showed the most significant change in MIC values against the MDR strains among the \u03b2-lactam drugs. Theseresultswere similar to those of clavulanic acid. The addition of avibactam reduced the MICs oftebipenem by16-fold and 32-fold against 36 and 20 MDR-TB strains, respectively(Table\u00a05).The MIC50 values of tebipenem were decreased from 8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml to 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml against theMDR strains. These findings indicate a good synergistic effect between avibactam and tebipenem.\nTable 5Effect of 5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml avibactam on the mics of \u03b2-lactam drugsMIC50MIC90The range of MIC decrease multiplesMIC range (\u00b5g/ml)MICDistribution widthSD of MIC-+-+Biapemem3246481\u2013320.5\u201364811.05Meropenem328128321\u2013164\u201364525.29Imipenem128645122561\u201348-2566147.33Doripenem16464161\u201332\u2264\u20090.5\u201332\u2265\u2009711.55Ertapenem64321281281\u2013162-128752.03Tebipenem80.51611\u201332\u2264\u20090.5-8\u2265\u200951.51\n\n## Sensitivity to lactam drugs when applied in combination with relebactam\nFinally, we examined the synergistic effect of relebactam with the six lactam drugs. With the addition of relebactam, both the MIC50 and the MIC90 of tebipenem were reduced by 16-fold, and the MICs of tebipenem were decreased by 32-fold and 16-fold, respectively, against 23 and 43 of the 105 strains. The above results indicate that among the six \u03b2-lactam drugs, tebipenem had the best synergistic effect with relebactam (which was similar to other inhibitors). In addition, relebactam had a good synergistic effect with doripenem and biapenem. Relebactam decreased the MICs of doripenem and biapenem by more than 8-fold against 61 (25.71%) and 54 (16.19%) strains, respectively. Similar to the other two inhibitors, relebactam showed the least synergistic effect with imipenem. Relebactam reduced the MICs of imipenem by 4-fold at most. The MIC50 and MIC90 of imipenem were only decreased by 1-fold in the presence of relebactam(Table\u00a06).\nTable 6Effect of 5\u00a0\u00b5g/ml relebactam on the mics of \u03b2-lactam drugsMIC50MIC90The range of MIC decrease multiplesMIC range (\u00b5g/ml)Distribution widthSD of MIC-+-+Biapemem3246481\u2013320.5\u20133275.86Meropenem328128321\u2013162\u201364616.65Imipenem128645122561\u201348-2566135.82Doripenem16464161\u201332\u2264\u20090.5\u201316\u2265\u2009610.30Ertapenem64321281281\u2013161-128846.79Tebipenem80.51611\u201332\u2264\u20090.5-2\u2265\u200931.11\n\n## Comparison of the synergistic effects of the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors with the six lactamase drugs\nWe further compared the effect of the combined application of the \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors on the six lactamase drugs (Fig.\u00a01). The synergistic effect is declared when the ratio of MIC without \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor to MIC with \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor is more than 4 times.Firstly, we compared the synergistic effects of the three traditional \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (namely clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam). The MICs of imipenem were decreased by more than 4-fold in 36 (34.28%) MDR strains after the addition of clavulanic acid, which was significantly higher than the decreases caused by the other two inhibitors. Moreover, clavulanic acid reduced the MICs of imipenem by more than 8-fold against 8 MDR strains, while the other two inhibitors only reduced the MICs by up to 4-fold. Therefore, clavulanic acid was considered to be the lactamase inhibitor that had the greatest effect on imipenem. Similar to imipenem, clavulanic acid had the best synergistic effect with the new \u03b2-lactam drug ertapenem. Clavulanic acid reduced the MICs of ertapenem by more than 4-fold against 55 (52.38%) strains, which was significantly more than that shown by tazobactam (30strains, 28.57%) and slightly morethan that shown by sulbactam (48 strains, 45.71%).\nFig. 1The synergistic effect of different \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors on the MIC values of \u03b2 -lactamsX-axis: 5 types of \u03b2-lactam drugsY-axis: Number of bacterial strains exhibiting synergistic effects after adding 5 \u03b2-Lactamase Inhibitors\nRegarding biapenem, combined application with clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam reduced its MICs by more than 4-fold against 72 (68.57%), 65 (61.90%), and 81 (77.14%) of the 105 MDR strains, respectively. Further statistical analysis showed that the synergistic effect caused by the combined application of biapenem and sulbactam was significantly superior to that of the clavulanic acid and the tazobactam groups(\u03c72\u2009=\u20096.56, p\u2009=\u20090.03). Similar to biapenem, the meropenem-sulbactam combination caused a drastic MIC decrease (more than 4-fold) against more strains (62.85%, 66/105) than the other two groups of drug combinations(\u03c72\u2009=\u200935.16, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition, the meropenem\u2013clavulanic acid produced synergistic effects at a higher ratio than the meropenem\u2013tazobactam. Sulbactam also showed a good synergistic effect with the two newer \u03b2-lactam drugs. With the addition of sulbactam, the MICs of doripenem and tebipenem were reduced by more than 4-fold against 79 (75.23%, (\u03c72\u2009=\u200910.18, p\u2009=\u20090.06) )and 97 (92.83%, (\u03c72\u2009=\u20097.52, p\u2009=\u20090.02)) MDR strains, respectively. Thisreduction was significantly greaterthan that of the other two inhibitors.\nWe further compared the two newer \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors (avibactam and relebactam)with the common clinical drug clavulanic acid in terms of their effects on \u03b2-lactamase drugs. As shown in Fig.\u00a01, the addition of clavulanic acid reduced the MICs of imipenem by more than 4-fold in 36 (34.28%) MDR strains, which was significantly greater than the effect of the addition of the two new \u03b2-lactam drugs (avibactam and relebactam, (\u03c72\u2009=\u200911.16, p\u2009=\u20090.004)). Moreover, clavulanic acid reduced the MICs of imipenem by more than 8-fold against 8 MDR strains, while the other two inhibitors decreased the MICs by 4-fold at most. Overall, among the six \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid was the most effective supplement to imipenem. Biapenem combined with clavulanic acid and the two novel inhibitors (avibactam and relebactam) reduced its MICs by more than 4-fold against 72 (68.57%), 82 (78.09%), and 85 (80.95%) of the 105 MDR strains, respectively. Further statistical analysis showed that the synergistic effect caused by the combined application of biapenem and the two new inhibitors was significantly superior to that caused by biapenem and the traditional drug clavulanic acid. In particular, biapenem showed the best synergistic effect with relebactam (\u03c72\u2009=\u20094.26, p\u2009=\u20090.04). The addition of relebactam reduced the MICs of meropenem by more than 4-fold against 76 (72.38%) MDR strains, making it significantly superior to other \u03b2-lactam inhibitors(\u03c72\u2009=\u200922.64, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition, the meropenem\u2013avibactam showed a synergistic effect at a higher ratio than the meropenem\u2013clavulanic acid. Like meropenem, relebactam showed a good synergistic effect with the three novel \u03b2-lactam drugs. The addition of relebactam reduced the MICs of doripenem, ertapenem, and tebipenem by more than 4-fold in 85 (80.95%, (\u03c72\u2009=\u200912.00, p\u2009=\u20090.001)), 65 (61.90%, (\u03c72\u2009=\u20090.37, p\u2009=\u20091.94)), and 100 (95.23%,(\u03c72\u2009=\u200912.83, p\u2009<\u20090.001)) MDR-TB strains, respectively, which were significantly greaterthan the decreases induced by the addition of avibactam or clavulanic acid. Compared with clavulanic acid, avibactam showed greater synergistic effects with the novel \u03b2-lactam drugs doripenem, ertapenem, and tebipenem. The two novel \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, especially relebactam, showed significantly greater synergistic effects with five lactamase drugs (excluding imipenem) than clavulanic acid.\n\n## Study of the correlation between synergistic effect and \nTo investigate gene mutations associated with the occurrence of the synergistic effects, we examined the blaC gene, which might be related to the synergism. In M. tuberculosis,the blaC gene encodes \u03b2-lactamase. As shown in Tables\u00a07 and 14 strains (13.33%, 14/105) had mutations in the blaC gene. The mutations were mainly three types of substitution mutations: AGT333AGG, AAC638ACC, and ATC786ATT. The most frequent mutation was the synonymous mutation at the ATC786ATT site, which was observed in 6 strains. Moreover, the mutation occurring at this site was synonymous. The AAC638ACC mutation occurred in 5strains, which changed the Asn at position 213 to Thr. In addition, the AGT333AGG mutation occurred in 3 strains, in which the Ser at position 111 was mutated to Arg. Since the synonymous mutation of blaC occurred in these 105 MDR strains, we used the synonymous mutation ATC786ATT as the control to analyze the impact of gene mutations at two other sites of blaC on the synergism between \u03b2-lactams and\u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. We found that compared with the synonymous control SNP, the meropenem\u2013clavulanic acid and the meropenem\u2013sulbactam combination showed greater synergistic effects in the presence of the Asn213Thr mutation. In addition, the synergistic effect was enhanced by 2\u20134 times in strains with the Ser111Arg substitution mutation compared to the stains with the synonymous mutation. No significant differences were found when examining the synergistic effect of other drug combinations.\nSince the d, d-carboxypeptidase DacB2 and the transpeptidase Ldtmtl(which catalyzes 3\u21923 cross-links) are also the targets of carbapenems, we examined the mutation status of these two enzymes. Sequencing ofdacB2 revealed a mutation at position 659 in five strains, which resulted in a substitution mutation of Leu to Gln. In addition, 1 strain had a GC deletion mutation at position 449. As for Ldtmtl, two strains habored mutations, which were the substitution mutations AGC101AAC and GTC848GCC.\nTable 7Gene mutations and the correlation with synergygeneNucleotide mutationAmino acid mutationNo of strainsEffect of BlaC mutation on MIC value after the addition of meropenemclavulanic acid-Meropenemsulbactam-Meropenem\nblaC\nAGT333AGGSer111Arg34\u201388\u201316AAC638ACCAsn213Thr58\u2013162\u20138ATC786ATTIle262Ile61\u201321\u20134\ndacB2\nCTG659CAGLeu220Gln5449 GC deletionFrameshift mutation1\nIdt\nmt1\nGCC659GTCAla220Val1GCC206GACAla69Asp1\n\n## Discussion\n\u03b2-lactams have been the most common prescription antibiotics, they include penicillin derivatives, sporins, monosporins, and carbapenems [33]. The high specificity and low toxicity of this class of drugs against bacteria make them essential for the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [34]. However, these compounds are rarely used in the treatment of M. tuberculosis, because the chromosome of M. tuberculosis contains the gene encoding BlaC, and the gene product confers resistance to most \u03b2-lactam drugs [35]. As a class A \u03b2-lactamase, BlaC catalyzes the opening of the \u03b2-lactam ring via the nucleophilic attack by an active site serine residue (Ser70) to produce acyl-enzyme, which is followed by the hydrolysis of the ester bond to generate an inactive ring-opened product [36]. Carbapenem drugs can be used specifically against the bacteria that have \u03b2-lactamase and are insusceptible to penicillins and cephalosporins [24]. The carbapenem drugs used clinically to treat bacterial infections include imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, doripenem, and biapenem [37]. These drugs contain the 6-\u03b1-1R-hydroxyethyl substituent on the \u03b2-lactam ring, which sterically prevents binding to other class A \u03b2-lactamases [38]. Carbapenems have a narrower MIC spectrum and exhibit more potent activity against the clinically isolated M. tuberculosisthan aminopenicillins [25]. The differences in their antibacterial activity are related to the mechanisms of action of l, d-transpeptidases (LDTs) and Ambler class A \u03b2-lactamases. LDTs participate in the biosynthesis of 3\u21923 PGcross-links. Therefore, LDTs can be effectively inactivated by carbapenems but are less sensitive to aminopenicillins [39, 40]. In addition, BlaC produced by M. tuberculo",
