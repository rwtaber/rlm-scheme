  "full_text": "## Introduction\nPerpetual consumption of antibiotics for antimicrobial therapy has led to the widespread emergence of antimicrobial\u2010resistant bacterial strains worldwide (Chadha and Khullar, 2021). Today, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the gravest public health issues. Pathogens have evolved into multi\u2010drug\u2010resistant (MDR) varieties as a consequence of overexploitation and unregulated usage of antibiotics (Chadha, 2021, 2021). Confining to this, the ESKAPE pathogens, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter sp., have posed a severe challenge in combating infectious diseases (Mulani et\u00a0al., 2019). The race between the discovery of newer antibiotics and superbug evolution is inclined towards the latter end. According to the statistics of the UN Ad hoc Interagency Coordinating Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, global drug\u2010resistant infections could inflict 10 million deaths each year by 2050 and impel 24 million people into extreme poverty by 2030 (World Health Organization, 2019). This scenario is grimly reflected in developing countries such as India, where the antibiotic consumption rates have nearly doubled (Taneja and Sharma, 2019). Alarmingly, one\u2010fifth of the world\u2019s AMR\u2010associated deaths have been projected to occur in India by 2050 (Dixit et\u00a0al., 2019). Realizing this, the United Nations General Assembly at New York (2016) conducted a high\u2010level meeting to address the global AMR issue (Laxminarayan et\u00a0al., 2016). Therefore, it is a global need to armour alternative intervention and therapeutic stratagems against the rising burden of AMR. In this direction, secondary plant metabolites and bioactive phytochemicals have regained immense prominence among the scientific community. The roots of herbal medicine originate from the Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani, the ancient healthcare systems of Indian medicine derived from the Indian ancient literature: \u2018Vedas\u2019 (Sen and Chakraborty, 2017). Research on traditional medicines has proven to be a cynosure for pharmaceutical industries as plants harbour repertoires rich in secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, tannins, saponins and polyphenols, which have been shown to resist pathogens and simultaneously boost the immune system (Behl et\u00a0al., 2021). Their antimicrobial potential has proved to be beyond comprehension, with promising efficacy at extremely low doses (Chadha et\u00a0al., 2021c). The antimicrobial properties of plants have been favoured worldwide due to their natural existence, easy and economic availability, formidable pharmacological properties and negligible cytotoxicity with the least probability of developing resistance compared to antibiotics (Cheesman et\u00a0al., 2017). Despite the advent of molecular docking, drug discovery development and the rise of the \u2018omics era\u2019, bioactive phytochemicals prove to hold strong and fertile ground for their therapeutic application in medicine.\nAmong the ESKAPE pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an extensively versatile gram\u2010negative opportunistic pathogen associated with nosocomial infections (Kerr and Snelling, 2009). It is highly invasive and toxigenic, and possesses an arsenal of diverse virulence factors ranging from the secretion of extracellular enzymes to exotoxins and biofilms to alluring but disarming pigments (Chadha et\u00a0al., 2021a). Nevertheless, its ability to be ubiquitous, furnished with remarkable tissue tropism and a multitude of intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance mechanisms make it an obdurate and notorious pathogen (Pang et\u00a0al., 2019). These factors synergistically orchestrate the manoeuvring of the host immune system and destruction of host tissues leading to high morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. P.\u2009aeruginosa is well known to be associated with respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia and chronic bronchitis in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe burn wounds, and gastrointestinal, osteomyelitis, bone and joint infections (Bodey et\u00a0al., 1983). A major proportion of pseudomonal manifestations result from urinary tract infections inflicted due to the insertion of medical devices such as urinary catheters (Cole et\u00a0al., 2014). Its role in the development of devastating eye infections such as keratitis, conjunctivitis, endophthalmitis, dacryocystitis and corneal ulcers with permanent loss of vision is well documented (Ferreiro et\u00a0al., 2017). Apart from this, P.\u2009aeruginosa is also linked with septic shock, bacteraemia, meningitis, endocarditis and brain abscess in patients undergoing neurological procedures (Shah et\u00a0al., 1999).\nThe pathogenicity of P.\u2009aeruginosa is regulated by a multitude of concatenated mechanisms, which in turn are stringently governed by a phenomenon called quorum sensing (QS) (Lee and Zhang, 2015). This resilient pathogen communicates and harmonizes at the intercellular level by releasing diffusible signalling molecules called autoinducers (AIs). The intricacy of the QS system in P.\u2009aeruginosa lies in the fact that the synthesis of AIs depends on the pathogen's population density, which in turn corresponds to the expression of virulence factors, biofilm formation, progression and severity of the disease (Erickson et\u00a0al., 2002). We have augmented the findings based on pre\u2010existing and recent literature and illustrated the QS circuitry of P.\u2009aeruginosa in Fig.\u20091 along with the virulence machinery each QS system activates, driving the progression of bacterial infection. This magnificent bacterial communication system has drawn tremendous attention from microbiologists because of its involvement in acute and chronic human infections. In this context, the global effects of the three QS systems in regulating the QS\u2010associated virulence hallmarks of P.\u2009aeruginosa have been described recently (Chadha et\u00a0al., 2021a). Thus, targeting the QS system can be a possible strategy to combat pseudomonal infections since it would directly impact the downstream virulence factors. This includes the QS inhibitors (QSIs) that target signal output, accelerating the degradation of AIs, or inhibit signal reception by directly associating with AIs, thereby armouring anti\u2010QS response called quorum quenching (QQ). Since QS contributes like an auxiliary factor towards regulating virulence elements in P.\u2009aeruginosa, its abrogation using QSIs does not exert any selection pressure for the emergence of any anthropogenic resistance, which is generally seen upon conventional antibiotic administration (Rasmussen and Givskov, 2006). Additionally, a fascinating aspect of QSIs is that they attenuate the QS circuits of a particular pathogen at sublethal concentrations (sub\u2010MICs) without posing any stress or survival threats (Kalia et\u00a0al., 2019). Hence, this seems to be a promising anti\u2010virulence therapy to tackle pseudomonal infections. A plethora of traditional medicinal plants, herbs and their constituent phytochemicals that have been elucidated to exhibit prolific QQ potential against P.\u2009aeruginosa is also considered safe for therapeutic use (Vandeputte et\u00a0al., 2010; Kumar et\u00a0al., 2015; Lou et\u00a0al., 2019; Topa et\u00a0al., 2020). QSIs derived from various natural and synthetic origins have been documented to attenuate the virulence machinery in P.\u2009aeruginosa (Kalia, 2013). Their deployment in the biotechnological arena to counter human infections has recently been described (Kalia et\u00a0al., 2019). Considering the colossal literature and tremendous potential of phytochemicals in therapeutics, this review is a humble attempt to recapitulate the findings by implicating the anti\u2010virulent properties of plant bioactives in attenuating QS and virulence in P. aeruginosa.\n\n## Quorum Sensing circuitry: the dictator for pseudomonal virulence\nIntercellular communication in bacteria stimulates coordinated responses to display a multitude of virulence traits that are not possible to achieve for individual cells. The signalling network in P. aeruginosa is perhaps one of the most complex yet profoundly studied examples among all the QS systems. It consists of multiple concatenated signalling pathways that synergistically regulate bacterial virulence, making P. aeruginosa a highly notorious and deadly human pathogen (El Zowalaty et\u00a0al., 2015). The QS circuitry in P. aeruginosa represents a global regulatory system that directly or indirectly controls the expression of more than 10% of its genome (Schuster and Greenberg, 2006) and about 20% of the bacterial proteome (Deep et\u00a0al., 2011). QS in P. aeruginosa is mediated through three main systems, termed Las, Rhl and Pqs. The LasR/LasI and RhlR/RhlI QS systems regulate the synthesis and signal transduction via N\u20103\u2010oxo\u2010dodecanoyl\u2010L\u2010homoserine lactone (3\u2010oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL) and N\u2010butyryl\u2010L\u2010homoserine lactone (C4\u2010HSL) AIs respectively. LasI synthesizes 3\u2010oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL, which activates the cytoplasmic receptor, LasR, which regulates the expression of genes associated with biofilm formation, haemolysins, proteases, elastases and exotoxin A production (Rutherford and Bassler, 2012). Similarly, RhlI synthesizes the C4\u2010HSL, which associates with its cognate receptor RhlR and drives the expression of virulence genes responsible for producing pyocyanin, hydrogen cyanide, siderophores, elastases and alkaline protease, and regulating bacterial motility (Papenfort and Bassler, 2016), while the Pqs system is modulated using non\u2010AHL signalling molecules called alkyl\u20104\u2010quinolones. PQS, structurally known as 2\u2010heptyl\u20103\u2010hydroxy\u20104\u2010quinolone, is chemically isolated from the AHL\u2010mediated Las and Rhl systems (Reyes et\u00a0al., 2020). It modulates the expression of genes involved in biofilm formation, inducing swimming motility and production of pyocyanin, proteases, elastases, rhamnolipids, pyochelin and pyoverdine siderophores, which favour immune evasion and induce lysis of neutrophils, macrophages and other host cells. Pqs null mutants have been demonstrated to exhibit avirulent phenotype with inhibition of biofilm development and production of elastase, pyocyanin, lectins and rhamnolipids (Jander et\u00a0al., 2000; Cao et\u00a0al., 2001; Diggle et\u00a0al., 2003). Although most of the virulence determinants of P. aeruginosa are regulated through QS, others such as type III secretion system (T3SS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production are not (De Kievit et\u00a0al., 2001; Pena et\u00a0al., 2019). Apart from these three QS systems, the last decade witnessed speculations over the involvement of a fourth QS system in P. aeruginosa, called the integrated quorum sensing (IQS) pathway. However, studies have recently discredited its role in QS and asserted that IQS is an aeruginaldehyde and a by\u2010product of pyochelin biosynthesis or degradation, putting an end to the previous conceptions of IQS to be a product of ambBCDE genes (Cornelis, 2020). Nevertheless, these three QS circuits play a quintessential role in the fortification and augmentation of virulence factors in P. aeruginosa.\nOver the years, scientists have proposed different models describing the cross\u2010talk between different branches of the QS signalling network. These have been in the limelight and sparked critical debates over the interaction of various QS systems in P. aeruginosa. In this regard, Lee and Zhang (2015) proposed that the three QS systems in P. aeruginosa are interconnected hierarchically, with the Las system occupying the keystone position regulating the signalling hierarchy. It has been shown to regulate both Rhl and Pqs systems (Lee and Zhang, 2015). Interestingly, a circular model establishing the interconnections between the QS systems in P. aeruginosa has been proposed recently (Maura et\u00a0al., 2016). It was documented that MvfR (PqsR) directly controls the expression of lasR and rhlR during early phases of bacterial growth with RhlR acting as a direct repressor of the MvfR (PqsR) QS system during late exponential and stationary phases (Maura et\u00a0al., 2016). On the contrary, binding of MvfR to lasR induces mvfR expression and the PqsH\u2010assisted conversion of HHQ into PQS, thereby increasing MvfR activity. These mechanisms were shown to function as stringent autoregulatory loops, dictating the QS circuitry in P. aeruginosa. Nevertheless, the QS systems of P. aeruginosa communicate with one another via chemical molecules known as quorum sensing signalling molecules (QSSMs). The LasR\u20103\u2010oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL complex multimerizes and activates the transcription of rhlR, rhlI and lasI, and other pseudomonal virulence genes, resulting in a positive feedback loop (Kiratisin et\u00a0al., 2002). The RhlR\u2010C4\u2010HSL complex also dimerizes and activates the expression of RhlI and its own regulon, thereby generating a second positive feedback loop (Ventre et\u00a0al., 2003). LasR\u20103\u2010oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL complex regulates PqsR, the transcriptional regulator of pqsABCD operon stimulating the biosynthesis of PQS and the transcription of pqsH, the gene encoding a probable monooxygenase (Schertzer et\u00a0al., 2010). Additionally, PQS has been found to enhance the transcription of rhlI, thereby influencing the C4\u2010HSL output and cumulative impact of the Rhl system (McKnight et\u00a0al., 2000). Also, the expression of pqsR and pqs operon is inhibited by RhlR\u2010C4\u2010HSL, suggesting that the concentration ratio between 3\u2010oxo\u2010C12\u2010HSL and C4\u2010HSL plays a decisive role in the dominance of the Pqs signalling system (Cao et\u00a0al., 2001). Although the Las and Pqs systems regulate the Rhl pathway like a QS\u2010command workhorse, most virulence factors dependent on QS are principally triggered by the RhlR\u2010C4\u2010HSL complex. Therefore, these systems represent a cascade mechanism commanding the virulence artillery of P. aeruginosa after achieving a quorum. This magnificent bacterial communication system has drawn tremendous attention from microbiologists because of its involvement in acute and chronic human infections. Deciphering the precise molecular mechanisms and potential targets behind these communication systems can help scientists in developing novel antimicrobial drugs that will help in targeted and combative therapy.\n\n## Orchestrating bioactive phytochemicals as potential therapeutics against \nWith the rise of advanced molecular techniques, countless researches across the globe are attempting to unravel the potential of novel antimicrobial. Unprecedented explorations during the 21st century have successfully established the mantle of bioactive phytochemicals in combating P. aeruginosa by impeding its QS, thereby attenuating its virulence factors and abrogating biofilm formation. Virulence factors and QS may be targeted by plant bioactives at distinct levels and/or multiple steps. Diverse plant bioactives and their derivatives have also been documented to attenuate the swimming, swarming and twitching motilities, which play a pivotal role in bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa (Khan et\u00a0al., 2019). We have depicted the chemical structures of bioactive phytochemicals reported to exhibit QQ, anti\u2010virulence and anti\u2010biofilm activities against P. aeruginosa in Fig.\u20092. It is evident from the figure that most QQ phytochemicals share a heterocyclic ring structure similar to that of AHL molecules. This structural confirmation may permit stable interactions with the QS receptors and their ability to degrade signal receptors (Kalia, 2013). For instance, ajoene, allicin and curcumin have structures similar to AHL side\u2010chains but with different oxygenation levels, while in 6\u2010gingerol, zingerone, eugenol, carvacrol and cinnamaldehyde, the lactone ring is replaced by an aromatic moiety making it challenging to open up. A similar trend can be seen with naringin, quercetin, naringenin, vitexin and baicalein, which share a complex polycyclic structure. Moreover, in silico studies have revealed that these phytochemicals strongly associate with the different QS receptors of P. aeruginosa (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2015; Rathinam et\u00a0al., 2017; Quecan et\u00a0al., 2019; Bose et\u00a0al., 2020a). However, these have not been confirmed by any interaction studies due to the non\u2010proteinaceous nature of bioactive phytochemicals. Nevertheless, findings from molecular docking experiments have been positively correlated with the downregulation of essential QS genes in numerous studies, both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2015; Xu et\u00a0al., 2019; Bose et\u00a0al., 2020b; Sharma et\u00a0al., 2020b). This has repurposed plant\u2010based bioactives as multifaceted compounds holding no bar for their deployment as futuristic anti\u2010virulence therapies.\n\n## 6\u2010gingerol\nGinger oil, derived from Zingiber officinale (ginger), contains this phenolic bioactive that activates spice receptors located on the tongue. Kim et\u00a0al. (2015) established the anti\u2010quorum potential of 6\u2010gingerol against P. aeruginosa using standard assays in\u00a0vitro. At a concentration of 100\u2009\u00b5M, 6\u2010gingerol significantly downregulated the expression levels of lasR and rhlR alongside rhamnolipid production by about 60%. It was also predicted that 6\u2010gingerol could directly associate with the QS master regulator LasR protein in silico, abrogating its functional role in the production of exoproteases, pyocyanin and pseudomonal biofilm. Moreover, the transcription of PQS operons, phnAB\u2009and\u2009pqsB\u2010E, T3SS\u2010related genes, QS\u2010regulated ExoT and elastase was also repressed by 6\u2010gingerol. More recently, 6\u2010gingerol analogs have been employed as biofouling agents in reverse osmosis (RO) systems (Ham et\u00a0al., 2019). Gingerol analogs disrupted QS activities and inhibited biofilm formation on RO membranes at significantly higher rates than 6\u2010gingerol itself (~\u200937% analogs vs. 22% gingerol), without altering them chemically or physically. The binding affinity of gingerol analogs to QS protein receptor LasR was also enhanced coinciding with the repression of lasB gene by 78%.\n\n## \u03b1\u2010Terpineol\nIt is a terpene alcohol and an integral component of essential oils extracted from pine, tea tree, etc. acclaimed for its application in the fragrance industry. Preliminary screening of plant volatiles provided the first insight into a possible role of \u03b1\u2010terpineol in QQ (Ahmad et\u00a0al., 2015a). It was reported to inhibit violacein production in an established QS biosensor strain of Chromobacterium violaceum by more than 90%. In recent years, this hypothesis was affirmed by Bose et\u00a0al. against P. aeruginosa using free and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) containing formulations of \u03b1\u2010terpineol (Bose et\u00a0al., 2020b). Expression levels of key QS genes (las, rhl) and virulence\u2010encoding genes including rhlAB, aprA, lasB, toxA and plcH were significantly diminished upon treatment with \u03b1\u2010terpineol. Swimming motility and biofilm formation were greatly reduced, as with the case of EPS, haemolysin, elastase and pyocyanin production. In silico analysis also suggested a strong binding affinity of \u03b1\u2010terpineol towards the QS receptors, LasR, RhlR and PqsR, accounting for its far\u2010reaching effects in\u00a0vitro. Furthermore, attempts to investigate the therapeutic role of \u03b1\u2010terpineol have been undertaken in\u00a0vivo. A follow\u2010up study in the murine keratitis model reported diminished bacterial count in corneal tissues with improved corneal histopathology and decreased inflammatory markers such as myeloperoxidase and reactive nitrogen intermediates upon treatment with nanolipoidal \u03b1\u2010terpineol (Bose et\u00a0al., 2021). Interestingly, treatment with nanolipoidal \u03b1\u2010terpineol exerted an anti\u2010biofilm effect on P. aeruginosa and stimulated immunomodulatory responses by enhancing the production of inflammatory cytokines, IL\u20102, TNF\u2010\u03b1 and macrophage inhibitory protein\u20102 in the infected eyes.\n\n## Ajoene\nAjoene, an organosulfur bioactive derived from Allium sativum (garlic), has been extensively studied as a potent inhibitor of QS and QS\u2010derived virulence factors. The first study in this regard surfaced when Harjai et\u00a0al. (2010) showed that crude extracts of garlic significantly reduced the synthesis of QS signals and virulence machinery in P. aeruginosa in\u00a0vitro. Consequently, P. aeruginosa\u2010induced pyelonephritis mice with orally administered garlic extracts exhibited lower renal bacterial counts with their kidneys protected from any tissue destruction as compared to their untreated counterparts. However, this bioactive was identified from garlic extracts by Jakobsen and colleagues (Jakobsen et\u00a0al., 2012). It was determined that ajoene downregulated the expression of key QS\u2010regulated genes: lasA, chiC, lecA, rhlA, rhlB and prpL in a concentration\u2010dependent manner in\u00a0vitro. Moreover, the anti\u2010QS activity of ajoene was examined using reporter assays. Ajoene (100\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u20101) attenuated biofilm production in P. aeruginosa by rendering them rhamnolipid deficient, thereby completely abolishing the lytic necrosis of PMNLs. It was even demonstrated in a murine model of pulmonary infection, where administration of ajoene (12.5\u00b5g\u2009g\u20101) resulted in clearance of bacterial cells as compared to untreated mice.\nCombinational anti\u2010virulence therapy using ajoene\u2013ciprofloxacin against pseudomonal biofilms and biofilm\u2010associated murine acute pyelonephritis has been investigated (Vadekeetil et\u00a0al., 2016). The compounds were reported to function synergistically in\u00a0vitro by inhibiting biofilm formation and swimming, swarming and twitching motilities in P. aeruginosa. Also, in\u00a0vivo efficacy of this combinational administration was proved to be prolific with significantly reduced bacterial load in the renal tissue of treated mice in comparison with that of their infected controls and solo drug treatments. Alternate molecular mechanisms underlying the QS inhibition by ajoene have also emerged. Ajoene was reported to repress QS in P. aeruginosa by the virtue of small regulatory RNA (sRNA) inhibition (Jakobsen et\u00a0al., 2017). Using reporter assays and qRT\u2010PCR, the expression of RsmY and RsmZ sRNAs was found to be greatly reduced by ajoene in a dose\u2010dependent manner during the early\u2010stationary phase of bacterial growth. Recently, structural analogs of ajoene have also come into the limelight as potent inhibitors of QS mechanisms. These ajoene analogs were reported to successfully target QS activity, thereby inhibiting the virulence factors including the production of elastase, pyocyanin and rhamnolipids in\u00a0vitro (Fong et\u00a0al., 2017). The compounds were also shown to impede and weaken biofilm formation on implants by P. aeruginosa in a murine infection implant model.\n\n## Allicin\nGarlic is a rich source of antioxidants, and anti\u2010inflammatory and antimicrobial compounds. Another principle bioactive phytochemical derived from garlic is allicin (diallylthiosulfinate), an organosulfur compound also called as the \u2018heart of garlic\u2019. In vitro effects of allicin on the production of QS\u2010controlled virulence factors and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa were assessed using standard assays and fluorescence microscopy, respectively, by Lihua et\u00a0al. (2013). The findings indicated that allicin (128\u2009\u00b5g\u2009ml\u20101) inhibited early bacterial adhesion up to 9\u2009h following treatment, while EPS production was reduced by over threefold in a dose\u2010dependent manner. Biofilm architecture also underwent a transition to a thinner and looser form. The production of exotoxin A and elastase was downregulated by threefold and 10\u2010fold, respectively, while pyocyanin and rhamnolipid production was completely abrogated under subinhibitory concentration of allicin. Lately, the mechanisms underlying allicin\u2010mediated virulence attenuation in P. aeruginosa were unearthed (Xu et\u00a0al., 2019). It was revealed that allicin inhibited the production of pyocyanin (phzB2 and phzM genes), pyoverdine, elastase and rhamnolipids (rhlA, rhlB and rhlC genes) in a concentration\u2010dependent manner. Concisely, qRT\u2010PCR analysis showed prominent inhibition of rhlI, pqsA, pqsD and pqsR transcripts, without affecting the las system. The suppression of rhl and pqs systems was substantiated when supplementation with C4\u2010HSL and PQS rescued the pathogenic phenotype of P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain by restoring the production of virulence factors. These studies have established the ethnopharmacological importance of allicin as a therapeutic drug that can be exploited to disarm the QS\u2010dependent virulence determinants of P. aeruginosa.\n\n## Terpinen\u20104\u2010ol\nTerpinen\u20104\u2010ol is a naturally occurring monoterpene, an isomer of \u03b1\u2010terpineol that forms the principle bioactive in tea tree oil. Thyme essential oil containing numerous phytochemicals, including terpinen\u20104\u2010ol, has been shown to suppress QS, thereby reducing twitching motility and pyocyanin production (~\u200974%) in P. aeruginosa (Bukvi\u010dki et\u00a0al., 2016). The terpene alcohol negated biofilm formation and exhibited prolific anti\u2010quorum activity by inhibiting the production of violacein (>\u200990%) in the AHL\u2010mediated QS reporter strain, C. violaceum (Kerekes et\u00a0al., 2013). Further, Noumi et\u00a0al. (2018) examined the QQ potential of terpinen\u20104\u2010ol on swarming motility in PAO1. Migration capabilities of the PAO1 strain were majorly inhibited by 25% in the presence of terpinen\u20104\u2010ol. Moreover, this monoterpene was also shown to abrogate biofilm production and simultaneously inhibit the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to polystyrene and glass surfaces.\nMost recently, an elaborate investigation shed light on the potential of terpinen\u20104\u2010ol to attenuate QS pathways, virulence determinants and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa (Bose et\u00a0al., 2020a). The QQ ability of terpinen\u20104\u2010ol was assessed in silico with QS receptors, providing strong evidence for its interaction with LasR, RhlR and PqsR. Subinhibitory levels of terpinen\u20104\u2010ol were found to downregulate the expression of lasI, lasR, rhlI, rhlR, rhlAB, lasB, aprA, toxA and plcH QS transcripts in P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. Further, the production of alginate, elastase, haemolysin and pyocyanin was found to be significantly reduced along with swimming, swarming and twitching motilities upon treatment with terpinen\u20104\u2010ol, corroborating the findings of virulence gene expression profile. Interestingly, biofilm architecture was disrupted leading to fragile biofilm with significantly reduced bacterial adherence. Nevertheless, a novel combinational approach using terpinen\u20104\u2010ol and ciprofloxacin proved to act synergistically against P. aeruginosa and its associated virulence factors, paving way for the innovation of novel anti\u2010virulence therapies.\n\n## Zingerone\nZingerone, also called vanillylacetone, is another bioactive derived from ginger responsible for imparting a sweet flavour. Researches over the years have proclaimed its diverse pharmacological properties as a potent anti\u2010inflammatory, anti\u2010diarrhoeic and anti\u2010diabetic agent (Ahmad et\u00a0al., 2015b). Nonetheless, the use of zingerone for silencing QS mechanisms and negating biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa has been assessed by various investigators. Supplementation with zingerone at sub\u2010MICs impeded swimming, swarming and twitching motilities by more than 50% as compared to its absence (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2013). SEM analysis revealed that zingerone prevented biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa on catheter surface without affecting bacterial planktonic growth. Also, a combination of ciprofloxacin and zingerone was shown to completely eradicate preformed biofilm of P. aeruginosa at significantly higher rates. In a follow\u2010up study, Kumar et\u00a0al. (2015) demonstrated that zingerone drastically truncated the production of QSSMs: C12\u2010HSL, C4\u2010HSL and PQS in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and standard strain PAO1. In consequence, the production of virulence factors such as pyocyanin, haemolysins, elastases, proteases and rhamnolipids was also inhibited. This QQ capability of zingerone was adjudged by in silico studies, where its affinity towards QS receptors was determined. Interestingly, molecular docking showed profound interaction between zingerone and receptor binding pockets of LasR, RhlR and PqsR attributed to the inhibition of these QS systems in P. aeruginosa.\nIn an attempt to enhance drug delivery with high specificity and efficacy, the development of nanoformulations is on the move. In this regard, zingerone\u2010loaded chitosan nanoparticles (Z\u2010NPs) have been developed with promising anti\u2010virulence properties against P. aeruginosa. The Z\u2010NPs were reported to be stable under varying temperatures, inhibiting the production of QSSMs in P. aeruginosa using a reported assay employing Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136 strain (Sharma et\u00a0al., 2020b). The production of alginate, elastases, haemolysins, proteases and pyocyanin was drastically reduced when P. aeruginosa was passaged under sub\u2010MIC of Z\u2010NPs as compared to zingerone alone. Moreover, all the bacterial motilities were inhibited by more than fourfold, while qRT\u2010PCR studies indicated that expression of lasR, rhlI and rhlR was downregulated by more than twofold in the presence of Z\u2010NP at sub\u2010MIC level. As a result, an anti\u2010biofilm response was observed with Z\u2010NPs, which successfully prevented biofilm formation and eradicated preformed biofilms of P. aeruginosa. Recently, the ex\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vivo efficacies of Z\u2010NPs were examined against P. aeruginosa in a murine model of acute pyelonephritis (Sharma et\u00a0al., 2020a). Z\u2010NPs were reported to be nontoxic to HEK\u2010293 cells (~\u200994% survival rate), reducing the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa and ensuring the elimination of bacteria from renal tissues with better recovery. Additionally, Z\u2010NPs enhanced the serum bactericidal property, accelerated the phagocytic uptake and killing of P. aeruginosa cells by mouse macrophages ex\u00a0vivo and induced an anti\u2010biofilm response in\u00a0vitro. These evidences have outlined the significance of zingerone as an alternative to antibiotics in combating pseudomonal infections.\n\n## Curcumin\nCurcumin is the major bioactive present in Curcuma longa (turmeric) imparting a bright yellow colour to the modified stem.
