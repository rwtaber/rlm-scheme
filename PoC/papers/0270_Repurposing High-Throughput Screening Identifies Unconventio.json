  "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen infecting cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs, causing acute and chronic infections. Intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance allow P. aeruginosa to colonize and persist despite antibiotic treatment, making new therapeutic approaches necessary. Combining high-throughput screening and drug repurposing is an effective way to develop new therapeutic uses for drugs. This study screened a drug library of 3,386 drugs, mostly FDA approved, to identify antimicrobials against P. aeruginosa under physicochemical conditions relevant to CF-infected lungs. Based on the antibacterial activity, assessed spectrophotometrically against the prototype RP73 strain and 10 other CF virulent strains, and the toxic potential evaluated toward CF IB3-1 bronchial epithelial cells, five potential hits were selected for further analysis: the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant ebselen, the anticancer drugs tirapazamine, carmofur, and 5-fluorouracil, and the antifungal tavaborole. A time-kill assay showed that ebselen has the potential to cause rapid and dose-dependent bactericidal activity. The antibiofilm activity was evaluated by viable cell count and crystal violet assays, revealing carmofur and 5-fluorouracil as the most active drugs in preventing biofilm formation regardless of the concentration. In contrast, tirapazamine and tavaborole were the only drugs actively dispersing preformed biofilms. Tavaborole was the most active drug against CF pathogens other than P. aeruginosa, especially against Burkholderia cepacia and Acinetobacter baumannii, while carmofur, ebselen, and tirapazamine were particularly active against Staphylococcus aureus and B. cepacia. Electron microscopy and propidium iodide uptake assay revealed that ebselen, carmofur, and tirapazamine significantly damage cell membranes, with leakage and cytoplasm loss, by increasing membrane permeability. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance makes it urgent to design new strategies for treating pulmonary infections in CF patients. The repurposing approach accelerates drug discovery and development, as the drugs' general pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological properties are already well known. In the present study, for the first time, a high-throughput compound library screening was performed under experimental conditions relevant to CF-infected lungs. Among 3,386 drugs screened, the clinically used drugs from outside infection treatment ebselen, tirapazamine, carmofur, 5-fluorouracil, and tavaborole showed, although to different extents, anti-P. aeruginosa activity against planktonic and biofilm cells and broad-spectrum activity against other CF pathogens at concentrations not toxic to bronchial epithelial cells. The mode-of-action studies revealed ebselen, carmofur, and tirapazamine targeted the cell membrane, increasing its permeability with subsequent cell lysis. These drugs are strong candidates for repurposing for treating CF lung P. aeruginosa infections.",

  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is the most prevalent respiratory pathogen in adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality due to a progressive pulmonary decline secondary to frequent acute pulmonary exacerbations (1). Once the infection is fully established, P. aeruginosa eradication cannot be achieved. Therefore, in CF patients, antimicrobial therapy aims to reduce the bacterial density in the respiratory tract (2). Despite the demonstrated efficacy of regimens based on cycles of nebulized tobramycin in reducing bacterial loads, repeated exposure selects many resistant isolates (3). In addition, the attitude of P. aeruginosa to form intrinsically antibiotic-resistant biofilms during chronic infection makes treatment of exacerbations more challenging (1). This scenario is further complicated by evidence that at the site of infection, bacteria grow under conditions (e.g., highly viscous sputum, acidic pH, anaerobiosis) affecting both the delivery and functionality of antibiotics (4, 5). As such, adequate treatment options are limited and new compounds with potent anti-P. aeruginosa activity are needed urgently.\nDrug discovery is a crucial process to discover compounds and molecules that may develop into clinical therapeutic drugs; however, it is expensive and full of risks of failure (6). In this framework, the redirection or repositioning of nonantibiotic drugs is a promising alternative since reusing drugs promotes the accelerated exploration of new properties, making the process less expensive than the traditional discovery of new drugs with antimicrobial effects (7). In addition, repositioning is more likely to produce bioavailable and safe compounds, as their toxicity has been known and reported for years (7). Several drugs belonging to the classes of antidepressants, antineoplastics, antacids, and hypoglycemic agents showed varied antimicrobial effects, and some against multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms, thus confirming the repositioning of existing drugs for antimicrobial purposes (8).\nIn this work, we used a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to screen over 3,300 compounds, mostly already launched, to find drugs with novel antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa. After evaluating their antibacterial effect against the prototype RP73 strain and 10 current CF strains, along with the toxic potential toward a cell type relevant to CF, five potential hits were selected for further analysis by the following methods: (i) bactericidal activity through a time-kill assay; (ii) synergism with tobramycin using a checkerboard assay, (iii) antibiofilm activity, using both viable cell count and spectrophotometric assays; and (iv) activity against pathogenic CF species other than P. aeruginosa. Finally, the mechanism of action underlying the anti-P. aeruginosa effect was evaluated by electron microscopy and quantitative methods to assess cell membrane damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. All assays were carried out for the first time under physicochemical conditions relevant to CF lung to give higher therapeutic predictive value to our findings. We selected tobramycin as a model antibiotic since it is the first-line therapy against P. aeruginosa lung infections (9).\n\n## HTS screening under \u201cCF-like\u201d conditions.\nIn the present study, we screened under \u201cCF-like\u201d experimental conditions the Drug Repurposing Compound Library (MedChem Express), consisting of 3,386 bioactive compounds (with 2,342 already launched and 1,044 that have reached clinical trial stages in the United States: 1 drug in phase I, 606 drugs in phase II, 372 drugs in phase III, and 65 drugs in phase IV) used as drugs with several therapeutic indications, including cancer, neurodegenerative, infectious, and cardiovascular diseases.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study in which an HTS is performed under experimental conditions simulating the actual physicochemical characteristics of the CF lung ecosystem that could affect antibiotic effectiveness at the site of infection (4, 5). First, the efficacy of antimicrobial agents should be evaluated in a chemically defined medium mimicking the nutritional composition of CF sputum. Several formulations of artificial sputum medium (ASM) were developed over the years using different combinations of mucin, extracellular DNA, iron, amino acids, and lipids (10). Second, the infected endobronchial mucus of CF patients contains hypoxic/anaerobic zones mainly generated by the respiratory burst of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the O2 consumption by respiratory epithelium (11). Third, it has been observed that the epithelial lining fluid of patients with CF is acidified, partly due to inflammation (12). The average pH of submucosal gland fluid in CF patients is ~6.6 to 7.0 (10). Both atmosphere and pH values were recognized among the most critical factors known to affect the activity of antibiotics (4, 13, 14).\nTherefore, to accurately judge the feasibility of the hits as potential anti-infectives in the context of CF, we investigated their activity in a medium proposed by Sriramulu et al. (15), recognized as being a suitable model of chronic lung colonization useful for evaluating therapeutic procedures and studying antibiotic resistance mechanisms (10), under acidic pH (6.8) and reduced O2 tension (5% CO2).\n\n## Identification of potential anti-\nWe initially identified compounds active against the P. aeruginosa RP73 strain through a 96-well microtiter plate-based HTS of 3,386 compounds belonging to the compound library. All compounds were initially tested at a single concentration of 0.1\u2009mM to pinpoint active hits. The results were expressed as the percentage of inhibition of bacterial growth compared to that in untreated controls, estimated from spectrophotometric readings carried out on supernatant and using the CellTiter (CT) assay (Fig.\u00a01).\nBased on this primary screen\u2014carried out in triplicate in a single independent experiment\u2014we identified 2,641 compounds able to affect P. aeruginosa RP73 growth, although to different extents: 1,783 with low activity (i.e., growth reduction of <25%), 640 with moderate activity (i.e., growth reduction of \u226525% and <60%), 112 with high activity (i.e., growth reduction of \u226560% and <90%), and, more interestingly, 106 compounds with excellent activity (i.e., growth reduction of \u226590%) (Fig.\u00a01A).\nThe complete list of the 106 compounds showing excellent activity is provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Based on their known pharmacological profiles, these compounds were grouped into different classes based on the primary target, considering that some compounds had multiple targets (Fig.\u00a01B): 86 were found among a total of 380 (22.6%) drugs with a \u201cbacterial\u201d primary target, validating the high fidelity of the antibacterial screening; 9 out of 219 (4.1%) drugs with a \u201cvirus\u201d primary target; 5 out of 107 (4.6%) drugs with a \u201cparasite\u201d target; and 7 out of 71 (9.8%) drugs with \u201cfungal\u201d primary target. However, perhaps strictly from the drug repurposing point of view, 10 compounds were found among the 2,268 (0.4%) multifunctional drugs used for other applications but with no known or characterized antimicrobial activity to date.\nBecause this work aimed to find new repositionable drugs, we decided to move forward only with those having a primary target different from \u201cbacterial.\u201d Twenty-three compounds meeting this criterion were initially selected after the primary screen and retested in a secondary screen\u2014carried out in two independent experiments, each in triplicate, confirming 14 compounds. These repositionable hit candidates comprise six groups based on their known function and clinical indications (Table\u00a01). They include the following: (i) six anticancer drugs (triapine [3-AP], tirapazamine, RRx-001, panobinostat, carmofur, and 5-fluorouracil); (ii) sulforaphane, resveratrol, and ebselen, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties; (iii) the antirheumatic auranofin; (iv) the antioxidant amino acid l-selenomethionine; (v) two antiparasitic drugs (bithionol and broxyquinoline); and (vi) the antifungal tavaborole. All were launched except for 3-AP, ebselen, tirapazamine, RRx-001, and sulforaphane, which are currently in phase III clinical trials. At first glance, the active compounds seem to be highly scattered structurally. However, the most active molecules can behave as electrophiles, undergoing the attack of nucleophilic groups (typically cysteine).\nThe hit rate we observed is surprisingly high (0.4% [14 out of 3,386]), probably because the library we tested consists mainly of approved drugs. Typical hit rates of <0.1% were reported for HTS of large, random chemical libraries of small synthetic molecules that commonly contain numerous non-drug-like molecules (16, 17).\nThe screening quality was evaluated using the Z-factor, a standard measure of the robustness and feasibility of an HTS, estimating the magnitude of the difference between the positive and negative controls relative to the sum of the respective standard deviations (SDs). The average Z-factor between the negative and positive controls in the 96-well test plates was 0.74 (range, 0.55 to 0.92), well above the 0.50 value, indicating the assay could reliably separate positive and negative controls. In addition to the Z-factor, the coefficient of variation (<10%) and the signal-to-background ratio (>10-fold) further supported the feasibility of our anti-P. aeruginosa drug screening assay.\n\n## Impact of the experimental conditions on the hits\u2019 activity.\nTo evaluate the influence of culture conditions on the screening results, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the 14 hits active against P. aeruginosa RP73 were also measured under \u201cstandard\u201d conditions\u2014i.e., those recommended by CLSI for susceptibility testing\u2014using cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth, neutral pH, and aerobic atmosphere.\nA comparative evaluation showed that MICs are different (\u22654-fold, \u22652 doubling dilutions) in most cases (12 out of 14 hits [85.7%]), with values consistently higher under \u201cstandard\u201d conditions (range, 4 to \u22658-fold, 2 to \u22653 doubling dilutions) (Fig.\u00a02). Conversely, MICs were similar (\u00b11 doubling dilution) only in the cases of 3-AP and bithionol.\nThese findings demonstrated the importance of performing antibacterial assays under conditions simulating the host environment: in this case relevant to the CF lung since they possibly affect bacterial growth and antibiotic activity (4, 18\u201320).\nIn this regard, the present study may serve as a proof of concept for screening repurposing libraries under clinically relevant conditions, revealing that the activity of the hits against P. aeruginosa might be higher under conditions pertinent to the infected CF lung than those suggested for the conventional susceptibility testing methods. For example, the improved activity of tirapazamine under \u201cCF-like\u201d conditions might be due to its activation under hypoxic conditions (21). However, defining the respective roles of ASM components, acidic pH, and reduced O2 concentration in the molecular mechanisms underlying the improved antibacterial activity was outside the present study\u2019s aim and warrants further investigations.\n\n## Activity of potential hits against a set of \nOne of the hallmarks of P. aeruginosa is its highly dynamic genome. Specifically, the nutritionally restricted niche of the CF lung appears to be a key evolutionary force shaping the P. aeruginosa genome, as indicated by the genome plasticity of individual strains (22). This heterogeneity among strains makes it necessary that a new potential antimicrobial be tested for its activity against a set of diverse and clinically relevant isolates. In this regard, the antibacterial activity of the 14 hit candidates was confirmed and evaluated in more detail by assessing MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values against the RP73 strain and 10 additional P. aeruginosa strains recently isolated from CF patients and chosen for their virulence and antibiotic resistance traits (Tables S2 and S3). The lowest concentrations of the compound capable of inhibiting the growth of 50% and 90% of the tested strains (MIC50 and MIC90, respectively) or at which no bacterial growth is evident (MBC50 and MBC90, respectively) were calculated to compare the activities of different drugs, and the results are summarized in Fig.\u00a03 and 4.\nAuranofin was the most active hit (MIC50, 0.025\u2009mM; MIC90, 0.1\u2009mM), followed by 5-fluorouracil (MIC50, 0.025\u2009mM; MIC90, 0.2\u2009mM), tirapazamine (MIC50, 0.05\u2009mM; MIC90, 0.2\u2009mM), carmofur and RRx-001 (MIC50, 0.1\u2009mM; MIC90, 0.2\u2009mM) (Fig.\u00a03). Auranofin, carmofur, and RRx-001 showed MICs of \u22640.1\u2009mM against all MDR strains (MG3871, CA3983, SM3483, VA3949, RP73), suggesting that the development of cross-resistance with the antibiotics is unlikely to occur. On the other hand, 5-fluorouracil showed high activity against strains classified as strong producers of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, and protease (BA3671, BJ3525, FM3986, NF3975, MG3871) (Fig.\u00a03). Resveratrol, panobinostat, bithionol, and sulforaphane were the least active, showing MIC50s and MIC90s of >0.2\u2009mM.\nMBC50 values did not allow comparative analysis since they were less variable, ranging from 0.2 to >0.2\u2009mM, while the MBC90 was always higher than 0.2\u2009mM (Fig.\u00a04). An antimicrobial compound is typically considered bactericidal if the MBC does not exceed 4\u00d7 MIC (23). Considering the measurable MBC/MIC ratio values, it was possible to infer that RRx-001 exerts bactericidal activity against most strains tested (9 out of 11), followed by ebselen (6 out of 11), tirapazamine (5 out of 11), carmofur (4 out of 11), auranofin (3 out of 11), and 5-fluorouracil (2 out of 11). No bactericidal effect could be observed for other hits due to a ratio of >4 or out-of-range MBC values.\nNo correlation could be proved between the sensitivity of the tested strains to the hit compounds and the presence of the antibiotic resistance genes or infection statuses (Table S2). Interestingly, RP73 was the most susceptible strain among those tested, thus highlighting the importance of confirming the activity of a potential hit against a comprehensive set of strains. Further work is warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying the strain-specific activity seen among the hits, including the target of the compounds.\n\n## Cytotoxic potential.\nRepurposing existing drugs offers the advantage of known pharmacokinetic profiles and safety. However, for novel applications, the cytotoxic effects of these compounds are still to be investigated. Considering a potential therapeutic application of the 14 hits selected from the primary antibacterial screening, we examined their possible cytotoxic effect on IB3-1 bronchial epithelial cells isolated from a pediatric CF patient using an MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium]-based colorimetric assay.\nTavaborole showed the safest profile since exposure for 24 h to concentrations until 0.8\u2009mM was not toxic to IB3-1 cells, followed by l-selenomethionine, 5-fluorouracil, panobinostat, and resveratrol, which were not toxic until 0.4\u2009mM (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Conversely, bithionol and auranofin were the most toxic to IB3-1 cells, causing their death already at concetnrations of 0.05 and 0.0125\u2009mM, respectively (Fig. S1).\nFifty percent lethal concentration (LC50) values, calculated after absorbance kinetic data normalization and nonlinear regression, showed a comparable pattern, with tavaborole as the less toxic hit (1.158), followed by l-selenomethionine (1.066) and 5-fluorouracil (1.061) (Fig.\u00a05). The other hits showed LC50 values of <1, although to different extents. Particularly, bithionol, RRx-01, and auranofin resulted in the most toxic hits, with values of 0.098, 0.070, and 0.009, respectively (Fig.\u00a05).\nNext, as a preliminary view of a compound\u2019s therapeutic index, we calculated the ratios between the highest hit concentration not toxic to IB3-1 cells and the corresponding MIC50 and MIC90 values (Table\u00a02). In terms of the maximum noncytotoxic concentration (MNCC)/MIC50 ratios, 5-fluorouracil showed the highest ratio, followed by tavaborole (ratios of 16 and 8, respectively), while l-selenomethionine, ebselen, tirapazamine, and carmofur had a value of 2. The worst ratio values of \u22641 were associated with RRx-001, resveratrol, and panobinostat. A significant decrease in values was observed when the MNCC/MIC90 ratio is considered. 5-Fluorouracil showed the highest value, followed by l-selenomethionine, and carmofur (ratios of 2, \u22651, and 1, respectively). The remaining hits showed ratios of <1, with the worst values of \u22640.0625 associated with auranofin and bithionol. Tobramycin showed the highest MNCC/MIC50 and MNCC/MIC90 values (64 and 32, respectively).\nTaken together, our findings showed that the therapeutic index is marginal. However, it is worth noting that 5-fluorouracil, the safest among the hits, showed a high MNCC/MIC50 ratio, only 2-log2 lower than that calculated for tobramycin, which would make it possible to create an aerosolized formulation to achieve higher concentrations and increase lung penetration, which is especially important for CF pulmonary infections.\nBased on the findings from cytotoxicity and MIC assays, only the hits showing the potential for clinical use\u2014i.e., those with a MIC of \u22640.1\u2009mM against at least 50% of P. aeruginosa strains tested, and with a MIC50 not cytotoxic to IB3-1 cells\u2014were selected for further characterization: ebselen, tirapazamine, carmofur, tavaborole, and 5-fluorouracil.\n\n## Time-kill assay.\nTo investigate the bactericidal activity of the selected five hits, time-kill assays were compared to the commonly used antibiotic tobramycin (Fig.\u00a06). The results confirmed the predicted antimicrobial effect based on the MBC/MIC values.\nSpecifically, a rapid and dose-dependent bactericidal effect was observed when P. aeruginosa RP73 cells were exposed for 2 h and 4 h, respectively, at 4\u00d7 and 2\u00d7 MIC of ebselen. However, the cell count decreased below the detection limit without regrowth over 24 h only at 4\u00d7 MIC, while a reduction by 4.3 log10 CFU/mL with a later trend to regrowth was seen after exposure at 2\u00d7 MIC. Other hits showed bacteriostatic activity regardless of the concentration tested, with carmofur as the most active causing, after 24 h of exposure at 4\u00d7 MIC, a reduction in cell counts by 2.6 log10 CFU/mL. Exposure to tavaborole at all tested concentrations allowed P. aeruginosa growth similar to that of unexposed samples. Tobramycin showed a precise dose- and time-dependent effect resulting in a bactericidal effect irrespective of the concentration tested. At 4\u00d7 MIC, the cell count settled below the detection limit more slowly than ebselen did (6 h versus 2 h, respectively).\nOverall, our findings showed that only ebselen has the potential to cause rapid and dose-dependent bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa. It is plausible to infer that ebselen retains this effect at least against 50% of P. aeruginosa CF strains tested, as suggested by the MBC/MIC ratio of 2.\n\n## Drug combination assay.\nCombination therapy is an important alternative when monotherapy is not effective. Indeed, synergism between two agents may reduce treatment toxicity by administering lower doses and reducing antimicrobial resistance. Few studies have tested anticancer-antibiotic combinations for synergistic activity (24). 5-Fluorouracil was reported to interact synergistically with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics when tested against Gram-negative bacilli, such as P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis (25, 26).\nTo evaluate whether the selected hits could synergistically interact with tobramycin, we performed a microdilution checkerboard combination assay against the P. aeruginosa RP73 tobramycin-resistant strain, and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values were calculated. No synergistic interaction was found, as suggested by the FICI values ranging from 1.06 to 2.00 (data not shown), confirming that the hits have antibacterial activity on their own. Further studies on other drugs approved for CF, such as levofloxacin and colistin, are warranted.\n\n## Antibiofilm activity against \nThe ability to form intrinsic resistant biofilms by P. aeruginosa is a relevant mechanism underlying persistent infection in the lung of CF patients (27). Therefore, the selected hits were evaluated using a crystal violet assay for their potential to affect biofilm formation and cause the dispersion of preformed biofilm by P. aeruginosa RP73 (Fig.\u00a07 and 8).\nAll the hits tested caused a statistically significant reduction in biofilm formation compared to the control after 24 h, although to different extents (Fig.\u00a07). Carmofur and 5-fluorouracil were the most active drugs, preventing biofilm formation over the tested concentration range. Tirapazamine was the least active, reducing biofilm biomass by 25.3% and 41.1%, respectively, at 1/4\u00d7 and 1/2\u00d7 MIC. The antibiofilm activity was dose dependent in the case of ebselen, tirapazamine, and tavaborole. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of antibiofilm activity reported for tavaborole and tirapazamine. About ebselen, although it has been reported to significantly affect biofilm formation by Helicobacter pylori (28), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (29), and staphylococci (30), no studies have been conducted on P. aeruginosa. The antibiofilm effect we saw in the present study could be due to the inhibition of alginate synthesis (31). In agreement with our findings, Guendoze et al. found that 5-fluorouracil, acting as an inhibitor of quorum sensing (QS), affects biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa, although at concentrations significantly higher than those seen in the present study (\u226560\u2009\u03bcM versus 12.5\u2009\u03bcM, respectively) (32). Other studies also reported that 5-fluorouracil efficiently reduces adherence and blocks biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli by inhibiting quorum-sensor autoinducer-2 production (33) and through global regulator AriR (34), respectively. Another mechanism could be the downregulation of expression of algD coding for GDP-mannose 6-dehydrogenase involved in the alginate polymerization needed for adhesion and following biofilm formation (35). From a translational point of view, clinical trials in humans testing the effect of 5-fluorouracil as an antibiofilm external coating of central venous catheters in critically ill patients have also shown its efficacy in abolishing colonization by Gram-negative bacteria and preventing bloodstream infections (36). Tobramycin significantly affected biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner (40.4 and 68.2% reductions versus the control, respectively, at 1/4\u00d7 and 1/2\u00d7 MIC), although with lower efficacy than 5-fluorouracil, carmofur, and tavaborole (P values of at least <0.05).\nNext, for the first time in the literature, we assessed the effect of the five hits against mature biofilm formed by P. aeruginosa RP73 after 24 h of exposure at multiples of the corresponding MIC value (Fig.\u00a08). Tobramycin was the most active hit, causing a significant, dose-independent, reduction of biofilm biomass (76.1 and 72.1% versus the control, respectively, at 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 MIC). Among hits, tirapazamine and tavaborole were the only active drugs, showing a comparable ability to disperse preformed biofilm. Specifically, when tested at 2\u00d7 MIC, biofilm reductions of 48.2% and 43.1%, respectively, were observed compared to the unexposed control.\nTaken together, our findings showed that all selected hits have the potential to be used in the early, aggressive therapy to prevent, or at least delay, biofilm formation even more efficiently than tobramycin, as in the cases of 5-fluorouracil, carmofur, and tavaborole. The effect on biofilm formation is not dependent on antibacterial activity since they were tested at subinhibitory concentrations. On the other hand, tavaborole and tirapazamine could be relevant to treating established, chronic infection by P. aeruginosa due to their specific effectiveness in disrupting the preformed biofilms.\n\nIn CF patients, the modification of the pulmonary environment and the alteration of mucociliary clearance favor the colonization of specific bacterial and fungal species that can interact synergistically or antagonistically (37, 38). Besides changing the composition of the pulmonary microbiota and the adaptation and virulence of specific pathogens, these interactions can have clinical consequences affecting antibiotic treatments for respiratory infections.\nIn this framework, we sought to investigate the potential broader-range applicability of the anti-P. aeruginosa hits by assessing their activity, in terms of MIC and MBC, against a panel of strains representative of other pulmonary pathogens relevant to CF patients, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, and Acinetobacter baumannii (Fig.\u00a09).\nS. aureus was the most susceptible species to the hits tested, whose MIC was \u22640.1\u2009mM for 15 out of 18 strain-hit combinations (83.3%), followed by B. cepacia (12/18 [66.7%]), S. maltophilia (5/18 [27.8%]), and A. baumannii (2/18 [11.1%]). MBC values were 0.2\u2009mM or higher, except for tirapazamine versus the Sa16 strain (MBC of 0.1\u2009mM). The apparent reasons for these findings could be the structural and molecular differences among these species. Specifically, the presence of an outer membrane may serve as a barrier for the diffusion of a compound to the cell wall and cytoplasm, thus explaining the higher resistance observed among Gram-negative species.\nWhen the hits were comparatively evaluated, tavaborole was the most active (MIC of \u22640.1\u2009mM against 6 out of 8 strains tested), especially against B. cepacia and A. baumannii strains, followed by carmofur (5 out of 8 strains) and ebselen and tirapazamine (4 out of 8 strains), which were particularly active against S. aureus and B. cepacia strains. 5-Fluorouracil was the least active, showing MICs of \u22640.1\u2009mM only against both S. aureus strains. Tobramycin was significantly less potent than the tested hits, showing MIC and MBC values of >0.2\u2009mM.\nOverall, our findings showed that tavaborole and carmofur have broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against CF pathogens, indicating their potential as a therapeutic possibility for CF patients. Further studies are warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying the species-specific activity of the hits.\n\n## Antibacterial mechanism.\nTo gain insights into the mechanism(s) underlying the activity of the hits against P. aeruginosa RP73, we first conducted a focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) analysis to visually observe the effects on the cell morphology and ultrastructure after overnight exposure to the selected hits at 2\u00d7 MIC (Fig.\u00a010A). Contrary to the unexposed bacteria, showing unaltered morphology with regular contours of outer and inner membranes, cells exposed to hits exhibited features suggestive of membrane damage, although to different extents. Ebselen caused surface blistering due to the development of regular and rounded vesicular structures. Most cells appeared strongly electron dense with the inner membrane scarcely distinguishable, while the outer membrane remained discernible and unaffected. A minority of bacteria showed the total loss of intracellular content, indented outer membrane, irregular/shrunken shape, and uneven or absent cytoplasmatic electron density. Ebselen-specific effects were observed in the intercellular areas with strongly electron-dense filamentous material and bigger aggregates of less electron-dense material. Cells exposed to carmofur displayed a distinctive morphological alteration involving swelling at the polar regions secondary to an increased periplasmic space, which, however, did not cause any rupture of the inner and outer membranes. Cells treated with tirapazamine showed outer membrane corrugation and many cells with residual or absent cytoplasm, and swelling phenomena could also be rarely reported. Exposure to 5-fluorouracil caused perforations and clear membrane rupture more frequently than other hits. Wrinkling, shrinkage, and content loss were also observed. A blistering phenomenon was also found with the formation of vesicles, although it occurs less frequently than with ebselen. Bacteria treated with tavaborole often showed leakage and partial loss of cytoplasmic contents; shrinkage and other outer membrane alterations were also commonly observed, while mild swelling and outer membrane vesicles were rarely detected.\nTo assess the causes of membrane damage observed at microscopic analysis, we evaluated possible membrane permeability changes. Propidium iodide (PI) is a fluorescent probe able to penetrate the damaged cell membrane and intercalate to DNA and was, therefore, used to investigate the permeability of the cell membrane. The exposure to carmofur, ebselen, and tirapazamine increased fluorescence intensity, although to different extents. Specifically, ebselen and carmofur were effective at each concentration tested, revealing a dose-dependent effect (ebselen, 1\u00d7 versus 2\u00d7 MIC, P < 0.0001; 2\u00d7 versus 4\u00d7 MIC, P < 0.0001; 4\u00d7 versus 8\u00d7 MIC, P < 0.001; carmofur, 1\u00d7 versus 2\u00d7 MIC, P > 0.05; 2\u00d7 versus 4\u00d7 MIC, P < 0.05; 4\u00d7 versus 8\u00d7 MIC, P < 0.01) (Fig.\u00a010B). The significant decrease in fluorescence observed when ebselen was tested at 8\u00d7 MIC was probably due to the relevant cell lysis, as inferable from time-kill kinetics findings (Fig.\u00a06). Tirapazamine was active only at 8\u00d7 MIC, while tavaborole and 5-fluorouracil never increased the fluorescence over the concentration range tested.\nChanges in the permeability of the cell membrane can reflect changes in its conductivity (39).
