  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nTuberculosis (TB) disease continues to be a global health threat with high morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries [1]. TB is primarily caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), a successful intracellular pathogen that invades human lungs as droplet nuclei [2]. Despite the directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) program, the incidence of TB is exacerbated by co-infections, co-morbidities, emergence of drug-resistant (DR) M.tb strains and a rise in the reservoir of latent M.tb infection (LTBI) [3]. The current anti-TB therapy has many limitations including long duration, use of multiple antibiotics, adverse effects of drugs and an associated lack of patient compliance. These limitations highlight the need to develop new treatment and management strategies for both drug-sensitive (DS) and drug-resistant (DR) TB in order to control infection more effectively [4]. The host immune status plays a significant role in TB disease outcome, though M.tb possesses several evasion strategies that favors its persistence and survival [5]. Thus, using adjunctive treatments with host-directed therapeutic (HDT) drugs that can modulate the host immune response is a promising strategy to increase the success of TB treatment [4]. Many studies have suggested that autophagy plays a key role in modulating host innate immune response by promoting several critical elements that target and eliminate intracellular pathogens [6,7,8]. Given these observations, the use of HDT drugs to upregulate autophagic pathway is currently receiving considerable attention as it could lead to effective treatment alternatives for both DS and DR TB. In this regard, repurposed compounds with prior safety and regulatory approval that could potentially target autophagy are mostly investigated for further approval as HDT drugs in TB treatment [3].\nIn this review, we present a brief overview of autophagy in the context of mycobacterial infection, the different methods to monitor and measure autophagic activity and summarize the various HDT drugs targeting autophagy that can be used as an adjunct along with anti-TB drugs (ATDs). Finally, we discuss the challenges associated in using HDT drugs activating autophagy to improve TB treatment outcome.\n\n## 2.1. Autophagy\nAutophagy, discovered in 1963 is a natural catabolic mechanism of the cell in which damaged or dysfunctional cellular components and abnormal protein aggregates are sequestered and fused to lysosomes for degradation. The resultant precursor molecules viz., free amino acids, free fatty acids, and ATPs are recycled back into the cytoplasm for new de novo protein synthesis and energy production [9]. This mechanism is highly conserved in all eukaryotes and plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis under normal conditions [9,10]. There are three main autophagic pathways based on delivery route to the lysosome: microautophagy, macroautophagy and chaperone mediated autophagy among which micro and macro autophagy are found in all eukaryotic cells [11] whereas, chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA) is only identified in mammalian cells [12]. Although these pathways are different from one another, degradation of cytosolic components usually occurs through the lysosomes. In microautophagy, lysosome directly engulfs and degrades small portions of cytosolic substrates for degradation [13]. Alternatively, in CMA cytosolic proteins are translocated into the lysosomal lumen for degradation after being recognized by heat shock cognate protein (HSC70; 71-kDa) containing a KFERQ-like pentapeptide sequence [14,15]. Finally, macroautophagy (henceforth referred to as autophagy) which is totally different from other autophagic pathways where a crescent-shaped isolation membrane or phagophore is formed (Figure 1). This phagophore engulfs the cytosolic components and fuses with itself to form a double-membrane structure termed as autophagosome. Upon maturation, the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome thereby delivering the cargo for degradation by resident hydrolases [16,17,18]. Earlier studies considered autophagy as a non-selective (bulk or generalized) canonical pathway triggered as a survival mechanism in response to stress signals such as nutrient deprivation and hypoxia. However, during the last two decades different studies have shown that autophagy can selectively degrade large endogenous material such as protein aggregates (aggrephagy), lipids (lipophagy), damaged organelles viz., peroxisomes (pexophagy), mitochondria (mitophagy), endoplasmic reticulum (reticulophagy) and ribosomes (ribophagy) as well as exogenous material, such as invading pathogens (xenophagy) through non-canonical pathway which require only a subset of autophagy-related genes [10,19,20,21]. It is evident that apart from cellular homeostasis, autophagy also plays a significant role in modulating host innate immunity by targeting and eliminating intracellular pathogens via xenophagy [6,7].\nIn the autophagic pathway, the formation of autophagosome, a structurally unique double-membrane organelle is a key characteristic feature. Unlike other cell organelles, autophagosomes can dynamically increase in numbers in cytosol upon receiving stress signals [9]. Classically, autophagy is a canonical pathway that is dependent on a suite of hierarchically organized functional proteins encoded by autophagy-related genes (ATGs) that are regulated by several transcriptional regulators (Figure 1). The core mammalian autophagy related proteins are regulated by transcription factors viz., EB (TFEB), zinc-finger protein with KRAB and SCAN domains 3 (ZKSCAN3), FOXO family of transcription factors (FOXOs), tumor-suppressor protein TP53 (p53), E2 Factor 1 (E2F1) and Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and peroxisome proliferation factor-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) [22]. The mechanism of autophagosome formation involves three stages viz., initiation, nucleation, and elongation each of which is mediated by conserved ATGs that are assembled into discrete functional units or complexes at the nascent phagophore. The ULK complex, comprising UNC-51-Like Ser/Thr kinase ULK1/2, ATG13, focal adhesion kinase family-interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) and ATG101, which is controlled by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). This ULK complex is responsible for the initiation of nascent phagophores at distinct sites in Golgi complex, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. The class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex comprises Beclin-1, and AMBRA1 (activating molecule in BECN1 regulated autophagy protein 1) which are released from their inhibitor Bcl-2 via., phosphorylation by the ULK complex, vacuolar protein sorting (VPS15 and VPS34) and ATG14. This complex is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate and promotes nucleation by the recruitment of WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting proteins (WIPI) to the nascent phagophore membrane. The transmembrane proteins ATG9, is involved in the supply of lipid bilayers for autophagosome formation. The phagophore is elongated by the action of two ubiquitin-like conjugation complexes viz., ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex which promotes the second ATG4-ATG7-ATG3 complex and enhances the recruitment of microtubule associated protein 1 (MAP1) light chain 3 (LC3) to the site. The ATG4 cleaves the pro-LC3 to form LC3-I, which is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) associated with the phagophore membrane by ATG7 and ATG3. Finally, the phagophore membrane has elongated and closed onto itself to form autophagosome, resulting in the sequestration of cytosolic content for degradation [8,9,23]. After autophagosome formation, the SNARE protein syntaxin 17 (STX17) localizes and interacts with lysosomal vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8) to form autolysosome, a terminal degradative organelle that enables cargo acidification and hydrolysis [24,25]\nAutophagy is governed by numerous signals that are usually categorized into mTOR dependent and independent (Figure 1) [26]. This mTOR protein contains two distinct complexes namely, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The mTOR dependent pathway is a classical pathway that negatively regulates autophagy. The mTORC1, if inhibited by starvation or rapamycin treatment activates ULK1\u2013ATG13\u2013FIP200 complex that signals the autophagic machinery present downstream of mTORC1, resulting in autophagy activation [27,28]. The other signals that activate mTORC1 and suppress autophagy are amino acids which control autophagy through the Ras-related GTP-binding protein/mTORC1(Rag/mTORC1) pathway [29], growth factors which control autophagy through the class 1aphosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/tuberous sclerosis complex/mTORC1 (PI3KC1a/Akt/TSC/mTORC1) pathway [30], energy status (high ATP/AMP ratio) and stressors which control autophagy through the AMPK/TSC/mTORC1 pathway [31]. Alternatively, the decrease in amino acids, growth factors and ATP/AMP ratio triggers autophagy activation through the respective pathways. The mTOR independent pathway that negatively regulates autophagy has also been described. The inositol levels, required for inositol signaling pathway inhibits autophagosome synthesis and the inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) by pharmacological agents, reduces the levels of free inositol, which results in autophagy activation without inhibiting mTORC1 activity [32]. A change in intracellular Ca2+ level and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level regulates autophagy through the Ca2+/calpain pathway and cAMP/inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (cAMP/Ins(1,4,5)P3) pathway respectively, in an mTOR independent manner [26,33]. Finally, autophagy is enhanced by the interaction of VPS34, a nutrient dependent lipid kinase (member of the PI3K family) with Beclin-1 through the c-Jun N-terminal kinases/beclin-1/PI3KC3(JNK1/Beclin-1/PI3KC3) pathway in an mTOR independent manner [34].\n\n## 2.2. Autophagy during Mycobacterial Infection\nThe role of autophagy in pathogen elimination has become increasingly clear over the last two decades [6,8,23]. The intracellular pathogen M. tuberculosis, after invading macrophages, resides and replicates within phagosomes and arrests the phagosomal maturation. Eventually, the M.tb permeabilize the phagosomal membrane via ESX-1 (Early Secretory Antigenic Target ESAT-6 system 1), a type VII secretion system [35] and escapes into the cytosol. The M.tb present in damaged phagosomes and/or in the cytosol triggers autophagy activation through the binding of ubiquitin proteins such as Galectin [36], Parkin [37] and Smurf1 [38]. Additionally, the cytosolic M.tb DNA is recognized by the cyclic GMP-AMPSynthase (cGAS)\u2014Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway and is tagged by ubiquitin proteins [39]. The tagged M.tb and other components are recognized by sequestosome 1/p62-like receptors (SLRs), a subset of autophagic receptors involved in antimicrobial defense. The adaptors P62, neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1 (NBR1), optineurin (OPTN) and nuclear domain 10 protein 52 (NDP52) or calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2 (CALCOCO2) recognize ubiquitinated M.tb and target them to autophagosomes for subsequent degradation [8,23]. Alternatively, M.tb phagosomes undergo LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), a non-canonical pathway that activates on receiving toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling(Figure 1) [40]. This pathway utilizes certain autophagic proteins which triggers ROS generation and the direct recruitment of LC3 and Beclin-1 to the single-membrane phagosome. The conjugation of lipidated LC3-II to the phagosomal membrane promotes phagosomal maturation and intracellular bacterial killing [41].\nCertain innate immune signals such TLRs, cytokine IL-1\u03b2 and NOD-like receptor 2 (NOD2) are involved in cross talk with autophagic pathways during M.tb infection. The TLRs, especially TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 are responsible for M.tb recognition and stimulation by these TLRs induced phagosomal maturation and autophagy activation via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon- \u03b2 (TRIF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [42,43,44,45,46]. The cytokine IL-1\u03b2 induced autophagic killing of M.tb in macrophages in a tank binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) dependent manner [47]. Finally, NOD2 that recognizes bacterial molecules (i.e., peptidoglycan) and induces autophagy by upregulating proteins such as LC3, and ATG16L1, resulting in M.tb control [48].\n\n## 2.3. Mycobacteria Defense Mechanisms Against Host Immune Response\nAfter entering macrophages, M.tb activates mTOR, increases lipid droplets and reduces autophagic capacity of the host in order to protect itself from autophagic elimination [49,50]. Further, a number of M.tb bacterial factors such as Eis (enhanced intracellular survival) [51], lipoarabinomannan, a mycobacterial glycolipid [52], ESX-1, a type VII secretion system [35] and M.tb protein CpsA [53] have been reported to inhibit host autophagic activity. However, pharmacological agonists of autophagy can overcome anti-autophagy mechanisms of M.tb and eventually eliminate M.tb.\n\n## 3. Measuring Autophagic Activity\nThe importance of autophagic activity has increased the need for a sensitive and accurate assay to monitor autophagy with possible high throughput applications. Many earlier reports have characterized several autophagic factors and substrates viz., the ULK1 complex (ULK1, ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101, and ATG9A), double-FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (DFCP1), WIPI family proteins (typically WIPI1), ATG5, ATG16L1, LC3, STX17 and P62/SQSTM1 as markers to study the different stages of autophagy [24,54,55,56,57]. The different methodologies employed to monitor and/or measure autophagic activity by using markers include electron microscopy, fluorescence and high-content image analysis, flow cytometry, immunoblotting and immunoassay [58,59]. In a previous study, Yoshi and Mizushima (2017) have reinforced the importance of evaluating the autophagic flux which includes autophagosome formation, fusion with the lysosomes and cargo degradation in the autolysosomes to accurately monitor and/or measure autophagic activity [60]. The assays for monitoring and measuring autophagy are improving over time to be more sensitive. On this basis, the following chapter describes the commonly employed autophagic markers in various assays to monitor autophagy in mammalian cells.\n\n## 3.1. Monitoring Autophagic Structures\nElectron microscopy was used to monitor autophagosomes in the late 1950s, after the discovery of autophagy. However, it was not a perfect method for functional studies as it is difficult to differentiate between the different selective autophagy in mammalian cells. Additionally, the difference between autolysosomes and other endocytic compartments and vacuoles are difficult to differentiate [59].\n\n## 3.2. LC3\u2014A Lipidated Autophagic Protein Marker\nThe mammalian autophagy protein, LC3 is a widely used marker to study autophagy, since most of the autophagy markers except LC3 homologs, detach either before or after autophagosome formation [9]. The nascent LC3, soon after synthesis is cleaved by ATG4 to form LC3-I that have a glycine residue at the C-terminal end. This cytoplasmic LC3-I, in the presence of ATG7 is post-translationally modified by conjugating with phosphatidylethanolamine at its C-terminal glycine end to form LC3-PE (LC3-II) [61]. Unlike LC3-I that localizes in cytoplasm, the LC3-II associates with autophagosomes both on the outer and inner luminal membrane until maturation that is the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome. After fusion, the lysosomal enzymes degrade the LC3-II on the inner membrane while those on the outer membrane are removed by ATG4 for recycling [9,61]. Many of the assays use LC3 as a substrate reporter to monitor and measure autophagic activity since the amount of LC3-II almost correlates with the autophagosome numbers [59]. Immunoblotting technique can be used to detect the conversion from endogenous LC3-I to LC3-II by using antibodies against LC3. The LC3-II migrates faster on SDS PAGE than LC3-I due to the charged nature of conjugate PE [62,63]. The limitations of this assay are that the amount of LC3-II only indicates autophagosome formation and not the overall autophagic flux. Furthermore, LC3 can also be recruited directly to bacteria-containing phagosome membranes in a process termed LC3-associated phagocytosis and therefore, some amount of LC3-II is from non-autophagosome structures [40,63]. The LC3 turnover assay by western blot or immunoblotting is used to measure autophagic flux by measuring lysosome-dependent LC3-II degradation. The cells are treated with pharmacological inhibitors such as lysosomotropic agents and protease inhibitors that block autophagic flux and prevent LC3-II degradation, resulting in its accumulation. The difference in LC3-II levels in the presence and absence of these agents represents a measure of autophagic flux [64]. It has to be noted that selecting the appropriate lysosomal inhibitors and the ideal concentration is important, as these inhibitors could suppress mTOR activity [65]. Autophagy gene knockdown/knockout can also be used to inhibit autophagy instead of pharmacological agents [66].\nThe use of a fluorescent-tagged LC3 (GFP-LC3) reporter to study autophagy by immunocytochemistry using fluorescence microscopy is a straightforward approach in which the endogenous GFP-LC3 is observed as GFP-LC3 positive vesicles or punctate structures. The number of punctate structures per cell usually corresponds to autophagosome numbers [67]. The turnover of GFP-LC3 reporters can be quantified in an assay by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) to measure autophagic activity in living mammalian cells. The disappearance of total LC3, as a result of degradation in autolysosomes, is ideally a good indicator of autophagic flux. Therefore, the amount of total cellular LC3, quantitated by flow cytometry correlates inversely with autophagic flux [68].\nRecently, Koepke et al. designed an eGFP-LC3B reporter that can be stably integrated into the target cell and standardized a protocol to remove cytoplasmic eGFP-LC3B-I from cells, resulting in only membrane-bound eGFP-LC3B-II [69]. Although, assays based on LC3 reporters could accurately monitor autophagosome numbers, caution must be exercised due to some potential limitations. This assay fails to differentiate whether the autophagic activity at a given time point is induced or blocked as autophagosome numbers are increased in both the settings. Also, as mentioned above, the possibility of LC3-II localizing on non-autophagosome structures cannot be ruled out. Moreover, LC3 is known to be regulated transcriptionally during autophagy [70] which may lead to wrong interpretation while using LC3 levels as indicators of autophagic flux. Finally, the chance of overestimating the number of autophagosomes is high, since GFP-LC3 punctate dot-like aggregates that do not represent autophagosomes, occur in cells overexpressing GFP-LC3 by transient transfection [67,71,72].\nA tandem fluorescent-tagged mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter can be used to monitor autophagic flux by immunocytochemistry and confocal fluorescence microscopy. This reporter is pH sensitive and the fluorescence of GFP (pKa = 5.9) is quenched in the acidic environment, while mRFP signal is relatively stable at acidic pH. When the LC3 protein localizes to autophagosomes, the reporter exhibits both green and red signals that usually appear as yellow. After the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome, the GFP signal is quenched making autolysosomes appear red. Yellow punctate accumulates, if there is a reduction in autophagic flux (autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion) and in case of autophagy suppression, both yellow and red punctuate structures are reduced [73]. The limitations of this reporter are that it depends on the acidic activity of the lysosomal enzymes that quenches the GFP signal. Furthermore, the intensity of RFP signal may reduce due to fluorescence reabsorption or fluorescence resonance energy transfer in tandemly fused RFP-GFP probes which may impede accurate quantification. Similarly, another tandem fluorescent-tagged mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 can also be used to monitor autophagic flux [74].\nAnother new probe, GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3\u0394G, a fusion protein of GFP-LC3 and RFP-LC3 without C-terminal glycine has been developed to evaluate autophagic flux qualitatively (fluorescence microscopy) as well as quantitatively (microplate reader or flow cytometry). Upon overexpression, this protein is translated as one fusion protein, which is cleaved by ATG4 family proteases, resulting in the same number of GFP-LC3 and RFP-LC3\u0394G proteins. During autophagic flux, the GFP-LC3 is degraded while RFP-LC3\u0394G remains in cytosol, serving as internal control. Therefore, the autophagic activity can be measured by calculating GFP/RFP ratio that is if the ratio is low then autophagic flux is induced and if the ratio is high, the autophagic flux is blocked. The limitations with this reporter are that homologous recombination could occur between the two LC3 sequences in stable transformants, yielding in GFP-LC3\u0394G that cannot be degraded by autophagy. Secondly, the time duration for a clear reduction of the GFP/RFP ratio is high [75].\n\n## 3.3. p62/SQSTM1\u2014An Autophagic Substrate Marker\nAn alternative approach to evaluate autophagic activity is by monitoring the autophagic degradation of p62/SQSTM1, a known autophagy substrate that functions as an adaptor protein in recruiting specific cytoplasmic components to the autophagosomes [76]. Like LC3, the degradation of endogenous p62 can also be detected by immunoblotting technique in which the decrease in p62 levels indicates autophagic flux activation, whereas the level increases if autophagic activity is blocked or inhibited [77].\nThe fluorescent tagged GFP-p62 reporter probe can be used to study perturbations in autophagic flux by methods such as immunoblotting, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry [78]. In another assay, Min et al. developed a quantifiable luciferase reporter system Luc2p-p62 or Luc2p-p62\u0394U to measure autophagic flux. During autophagic flux, the Luc2p-p62 is degraded while Luc2p-p62\u0394U remains in cytosol, as a normalization control due to its resistance to autophagic degradation. Therefore, increased Luc2p-p62\u0394U/Luc2p-p62 ratio would directly reflect autophagic flux induction and vice versa [79].\nA time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay has been described which uses both LC3B-II and p62 markers to monitor autophagic activity. This method relies on energy transfer between two fluorophores, a donor that transfers energy when excited and an acceptor that emits a fluorescent signal, when situated in close proximity. The increased autophagic activity results in increased LC3-II signal and decreased p62 signal, whereas when autophagic flux is blocked at the lysosome fusion stage both LC3-II and p62 signals are increased [80]. It must be noted that, like LC3 transcriptional upregulation has also been reported and therefore autophagic flux may need to be measured by a combination of other techniques [79].\n\n## 3.4. Other Markers to Monitor Autophagic Activity\nIn addition, to LC3 and p62, early markers of autophagy viz., ATG5 [81], ATG16 [82], DFCP1 [83], and WIPI-1 [84] can be assessed to monitor the different stages of autophagic activity. Further, the phosphorylation of ATG14-Ser29 can also be used to monitor autophagy initiation [85]. Tian et al. developed and characterized a monoclonal antibody to monitor newly forming autophagosomes by measuring phosphorylation of the endogenous protein ATG16L1. The described antibody can be used in western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Since it is present during autophagy initiation, its levels are not affected by late-stage autophagy blocks and can discriminate very well between autophagy induction and autophagosome accumulation [86].\nThough several different markers and assays to monitor autophagic activity have been reported, there is still no single \u201cgold standard\u201d assay to measure autophagic activity in mammalian cells [66]. The techniques available to measure autophagy ranges from direct observation and measurement of autophagosomes in a cell using electron microscopy to more specific quantification of protein markers, primarily LC3 and p62/SQSTM1. Improvised techniques, including the use of fluorescent reporters like GFP, RFP or luciferase reporter like Luc2 to measure autophagic markers have superior accuracy than conventional immunoblotting methods. These systems aid in high throughput assays using either fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, microtiter plate assays or TR-FRET assays. However, measuring autophagic flux, which corresponds to the amount of autophagic degradation in a cell, is crucial in determining autophagy accurately. In addition to measuring autophagic flux, it is highly recommended to use secondary assays for additional characterization. The upregulation of different autophagy proteins at the mRNA level may not necessarily correlate with functional autophagy, nonetheless, it can reflect an intact signaling pathway. Therefore, measuring mRNA levels of autophagy proteins by PCR-based approaches can still be used as a secondary assay to characterize perturbations in autophagic activity [87]. When a decrease in autophagic flux is reported, the efficiency of autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion can be determined by estimating colocalization between autophagosomal (LC3-II, STX17) and lysosomal (Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) markers [88]. Galectins can be used to evaluate endo-lysosomal damage caused by pathogens and lysomotrophic agents [89]. Further, lysosomal activity can be evaluated by using LysoTracker which monitors lysosomal acidification [88] and lysosomal-METRIQ which monitors the overall lysosomal integrity [90].\n\n## 4. Potential Autophagy Activating Drugs for Host Directed Therapy against Mycobacterial Infection in Pre-Clinical Trials\nHost directed therapeutic strategy that enhances the protective immunity against emerging infectious diseases has gained significant importance over the last two decades [91]. Host directed therapeutic drugs as adjuncts with existing TB drugs for M.tb infection could lead to shorter and more effective treatments for tuberculosis. A literary search of pre-clinical trials and animal model studies revealed that repurposing licensed drugs with autophagy inducing potential, showed effective therapeutic manipulation of host immunity against M.tb infection. Many of these drugs already have well-defined safety and pharmacokinetic profiles and are more likely to be investigated in randomized and controlled clinical trials that will evaluate their effectiveness in TB. The potential HDT drug candidates from different drug/compound types that target autophagy and the mechanism involved in manipulating host immunity against M.tb infection are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1.\n\n## 4.1. Small-Molecules\nSmall molecules are increasingly being tested for their ability to enhance autophagy against different disease phenotypes [92]. Many small-molecules have also been reported for their ability to inhibit intracellular M.tb replication through autophagy activation [93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101]. Flotoet al. described two compounds termed as small-molecule enhancers of rapamycin (SMERs) that induce autophagy at the stage of autophagosome formation without decreasing mTOR activity. The SMER 18 and 28 had the highest autophagic activity in M.tb infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), resulting in the inhibition and clearance of intracellular M.tb [93].\nThe small molecule 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), a direct AMPK activator, was reported to enhance autophagy in different mammalian cells viz., human monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells), RAW 264.7 cells and mice bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) against M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv [94]. This molecule induces autophagy in M.tb infected cells by activating AMPK that inhibits M.tb-mediated mTOR activation. Furthermore, this AMPK activation by AICAR induced Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A), a transcriptional coactivator protein that upregulated multiple autophagy related genes via CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (CEBPB) and enhanced autophagic flux in M.tb infected cells [94].\nThe synthetic small molecule, GSK4112 that acts as an agonist to nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1), a transcriptional repressor protein was reported to induce autophagic flux and increase lysosome biogenesis [95]. The transcriptional protein NR1D1 plays a key role in infection and inflammation [102] and its activation led to the modulation in the expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB). The upregulation of TFEB increased the number of both autophagosomes and lysosomes in M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv infected THP-1 cells [95].\nKim et al. reported that GW7647, a synthetic small molecule agonist of the PPAR\u03b1 transcription factor enhances autophagic flux against M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv in mice BMDMs. The PPAR\u03b1 activation by GW7647 resulted in the upregulation and translocation of TFEB, a critical regulator of various genes involved in autophagic flux. Further, PPAR-\u03b1 activation inhibited lipid body formation during mycobacterial infection [96].\nThe small molecule SRT 1720, a synthetic activator of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylase was observed to restrict the growth of intracellular mycobacteria in THP-1 cells and human primary monocyte-derived macrophages(HMDMs) [97].",
