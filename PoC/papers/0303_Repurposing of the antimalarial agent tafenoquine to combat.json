  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a notorious Gram-positive coccus that usually colonizes the nasopharynx (1). S. aureus is a major pathogen that causes infections of the skin and soft tissues, lung, respiratory tract, or surgical sites, resulting in cardiovascular and intravenous indwelling device infections (2). In recent years, S. aureus bacteremia has become a serious threat because of its rising morbidity with 10%\u201330% mortality (2\u20134). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was first identified in 1961, and in the following decade, outbreaks occurred in hospitals worldwide (5), with mortality from MRSA infection exceeding acquired immune deficiency syndrome, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (6). Subsequently, vancomycin (VAN)-intermediate and VAN-resistant S. aureus were reported in 1997 and 2002, respectively. Although they did not cause an epidemic, the treatment of resistant strains of S. aureus has become a serious challenge (7, 8).\nThe biofilm and persister cells are tolerant to antimicrobial agents and they often result in the failure of clinical therapy (9). Biofilms are extracellular complex structures composed of populations of microorganisms attached to the surface of the substrate, and bacteria within the biofilm are highly adherent and resistant, evading the host\u2019s immune response and avoiding antibiotic killing (10). Persister cells are small subsets of cells with non-heritable phenotypic variations. Persister cells are slow growing or dormant and can tolerate some high antibiotic concentrations and cause recurrence of infection (11). Therefore, it is necessary to explore the antimicrobial agent against the S. aureus-resistant phonotypes of biofilm and persister cells.\nAntibacterial agents that selectively target the bacterial cell membrane are a promising strategy to overcome resistance. Because the bacterial cell membrane disruptors could act without entering into the inner cell. Moreover, the cell membrane disruptors can circumvent common bacterial resistance mechanisms such as enzymatic degradation and efflux pump (12, 13). Membrane-active antimicrobial agents are usually lipophilic, which allows better interaction with bacterial membranes, and disrupts the physiological function and physical integrity. It is undoubtedly that cell membranes are crucial for bacteria to maintain cellular homeostasis and perform metabolic activities. Although persister cells can escape conventional antibiotic killing by drastically downregulating the biosynthetic activities, they still need to convert energy in some way to maintain cell viability. Usually, this activity is dependent on the cell membrane (14). Therefore, the membrane-active antimicrobial agent is a promising way to combat persister cells.\nIn this period of bacterial resistance outbreaks and the high cost of new antibiotic development, drug repurposing is an attractive alternative to the discovery of antimicrobial agents. The pharmacological and toxicological information of the repurposed drug are well characterized; hence, the development costs could be reduced (15). For example, drug repurposing can save around 7 years and 15% of the costs compared to developing a new antibiotic by conventional way, and the known drug information greatly reduces the risk of failure (16).\nThe phenotype-based screening has emerged as an effective approach to antimicrobials discovery. Compared with mechanism-based screening strategies, it can be more effective in discovering compounds that target particular pathogens. Although the mechanism of these candidates is usually unknown, their known functions can serve as clues for mechanistic studies (17). Tafenoquine (TAF) is an 8-aminoquinoline that was first approved for the treatment of malaria in 2018 (18). The exact mechanism of TAF against plasmodium is unknown, but the process may involve interference of cytochrome C reductase leading to mitochondrial membrane depolarization, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (18). The bioactive effects of TAF against parasites, fungi, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been previously reported; however, its efficacy against other bacteria is unknown (19, 20). In the present study, using high-throughput screening, we identified TAF to be a potential antibacterial candidate against MRSA. Further, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity as well as mechanisms of TAF in depth.\n\n## Bacterial strains, culture conditions, and reagents\nType strains of S. aureus (ATCC 43300, USA300, ATCC 29213, and ATCC 25923), Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). S. aureus Newman was provided by Min Li (Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China). S. aureus LZB1 and other clinical isolates were identified in the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, China) and identified by VETIK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) and MALDI-TOF (Bruker, Germany) (21). Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and RP62A were provided by Di Qu (Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China). Other Gram-negative bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, were provided by Juncai Luo (Tiandiren Biotech, Changsha, China). Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was provided by Minqiang Qiao (College of Life Sciences of Nankai University, Tianjin, China). Gram-positive cocci of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were cultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB) and brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth, respectively. Gram-negative strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. All media were purchased from Solarbio (Shanghai, China). TAF and other antibiotics were purchased from MedChem Express (New Jersey, USA) and dissolved in deionized water or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility test\nAccording to the recommendations of the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (22), the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of drugs was determined using the standard microdilution. First, the bacteria were grown to log phase and diluted with Mueller\u2013Hinton (MH) II broth to 1.5 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL. Then, 50 \u00b5L of serially diluted reagents with 50 \u00b5L of the bacterial suspension were added to a 96-well plate. After incubating at 37\u00b0C for 16\u201318 h, the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibited visible bacterial growth. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was defined as the lowest concentration with visible colony growth on plates.\n\n## High throughput screening\nTo find the antimicrobial molecules against S. aureus, the FDA-approved molecular library (Cat. No.: HY-L022, MedChem Express, New Jersey, USA) was selected with a storage concentration of 10 mM in DMSO. In the initial screening process, the log-phased S. aureus USA300 was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland (McF) with MH broth, then 99 \u00b5L of the bacterial suspension with 1 \u00b5L compound was mixed and added to a 96-well plate (~100 \u00b5M per well), and OD630 nm was detected after 16\u201318 h incubation at 37\u00b0C. For the second screening procedure, the compound concentration was set as 50 \u00b5M and six hits were selected after removing the well-studied antimicrobials. After determining the MICs and MBCs of these candidates, TAF was ultimately selected for further study (23).\n\n## Time-inhibiting and killing kinetics\nOvernight culture of S. aureus was diluted to 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL with MH broth and incubated at 37\u00b0C 180 rpm in the presence of indicated concentrations of TAF. OD630 nm was measured and the colony-forming unit (CFU) was counted at the particular time points of 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, respectively. DMSO (1%, vol/vol) was used as a control (24).\n\n## Resistance-inducing assay\nMICs of TAF, ciprofloxacin (CIP), and rifampin (RFP) against S. aureus were determined as described above on the first day. The bacterial suspension in sub-MIC (1/2 \u00d7 MIC) was 1,000-fold diluted with MH broth for the next day\u2019s MIC determination. After 15 days of passages, the CIP- and RFP-induced resistant S. aureus strains of the last passage were used to detect the cross-resistance by TAF (24).\n\n## Checkerboard dilution assay\nLog phase grown S. aureus ATCC 43300 was diluted to 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL with MH broth. Fifty microliters of the bacterial suspension was mixed in equal volumes with serially diluted drugs into an \u201c8 \u00d7 8\u201d checkerboard. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 16\u201318 h, the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) between TAF and conventional antibiotics was calculated as follows:\nFICI \u22640.5 indicates synergism; 0.5 < FICI < 1 indicates partial synergism; FICI = 1 indicates addition; 1 < FICI \u2264 4 indicates indifference; and FICI >4 indicates antagonism (25).\n\n## Persister cells killing assay\nS. aureus was grown for 24 h at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm to the stationary phase to obtain persister cells (25). The persister cells were washed three times with 1 \u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and adjusted to OD630 = 0.2. Then, the persister cells were treated with 16 or 10 \u00d7 MIC of VAN, daptomycin (DAP), gentamicin (GEN), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) to confirm the status of the persistant. For the persister cells killing assay, indicated concentrations of TAF were added into the persister cells, and the CFUs at the time point of 0, 2, 4, and 6 h were counted by fold dilution, respectively. DMSO (1%, vol/vol) was used as a control.\n\n## Antibiofilm activity of TAF\nS. aureus ATCC 43300 was incubated overnight in the stationary phase, and the bacterial suspension was diluted at 1:100 with TSB. For biofilm inhibition, the suspension was mixed with indicated concentrations of TAF and added to a 96-well plate. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, the planktonic cells were carefully removed and the biofilm was washed with sterile saline. Then, the biofilm was fixed with methanol and stained with 0.25% (wt/vol) crystal violet (CV) for 15 min and washed three times with sterile saline. The dye attached to the biofilm was dissolved in 95% ethanol for 20 min, and the biomass of the biofilm was quantified by measuring A570 nm. For biofilm eradication, the bacterial suspension was allowed to form biofilm in a 96-well plate by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h as described above. Then, the biofilm was washed and incubated with fresh TSB in the presence of indicated concentrations of TAF for another 24 h. CV staining was performed to quantify the biomass of biofilm. In addition, a fold dilution assay on agar plates was used to count the planktonic cells (26).\n\n## Ultrastructure observation by electronic microscopy (EM)\nTwenty milliliters of fresh TSB was mixed with 10 \u00b5L of bacterial suspension of S. aureus ATCC 43300, then cultured to the log phase. The cultures were centrifuged at 4,000\u00d7 g for 8 min, and the sediment was washed twice with sterile saline. The bacterial cells were resuspended to McF = 0.5 with fresh TSB containing 5 \u00d7 MIC of TAF or DMSO. After incubating at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm for 1 h, the bacteria were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and 4,000\u00d7 g for 8 min, and the sediment was transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and washed with 1 mL PBS and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. For scanning EM (SEM), the fixative was removed with PBS and dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol (25, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100%) for 10 min for each solution. After drying, the samples were covered with gold palladium. For transmission EM (TEM), contrast was performed with 2% uranyl acetate and 2% osmium tetroxide in the dark. The material was then passed through an increasing series of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin. Sections were prepared from the resin, placed on a copper grid, and stained for lead citrate. After sample preparation, cellular ultrastructure was observed using SEM and TEM (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan), respectively (27).\n\n## Bacterial membrane permeability assay\nLog phase grown S. aureus ATCC 43300 was centrifuged at 4,000\u00d7 g for 8 min, and the sediment was rinsed three times with 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) and resuspended to OD630 = 0.2. After incubation in the dark with 2 \u00b5M of SYTOX Green for 15 min, the mixture was added to a black 96-well plate with indicated concentrations of TAF. The fluorescence intensity was consecutively measured every 5 min for a total of 30 min with excitation wavelength (\u03bbex) and emission wavelength (\u03bbem) of 485 and 525 nm, respectively. Melittin and 1% (vol/vol) DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (28).\n\n## Membrane depolarization assay\nS. aureus ATCC 43300 suspension was prepared as described above, except that HEPES buffer contained 5 mM glucose and 100 mM KCl. DiSC3(5) with a final concentration of 2 \u00b5M was incubated with the bacterial suspension for 45 min in the dark and then mixed with indicated concentrations of TAF. Fluorescence intensity was measured every 30 s for a total of 5 min with the \u03bbex and \u03bbem of 622 and 670 nm, respectively. Melittin and 1% (vol/vol) DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (23).\n\n## ROS detection\nThe overnight growth of S. aureus ATCC 43300 was washed and suspended to OD630 = 0.5 with PBS. The suspension was incubated with H2DCFDA (10 \u00b5M) for 30 min in the dark. Then, 90 \u00b5L mixture and 10 \u00b5L TAF were added to black 96-well plates and incubated for 30 min. Fluorescence intensity was measured with the \u03bbex and \u03bbem of 488 and 525 nm, respectively. Melittin and 1% (vol/vol) DMSO were used as positive and negative controls, respectively (23).\nFluorescence probes HKSOX-1, HKperox-2, and HKOH-1r (MedChem Express, New Jersey, USA) were used to evaluate the levels of specific reactive species of superoxide anion (O2\u2022\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), respectively. As described previously, the bacterial suspension was co-incubated with 10 \u00b5M fluorescent probes for 30 min and then mixed with indicated concentrations of TAF, the fluorescence intensities were measured after another 30 min incubation, respectively, with \u03bbex/\u03bbem = 500/520 nm, 520/543 nm, and 500/520 nm for HKSOX-1, HKperox-2, and HKOH-1r, respectively (29\u201331).\n\n## Confocal laser scanning microscopy\nInitially, log phase S. aureus ATCC 43300 was suspended to OD630 = 0.1 after being rinsed twice with 1 \u00d7 PBS. After incubation for 1 h with the addition of indicated concentrations of TAF, the supernatant was removed by centrifugation, and the sediment was washed and resuspended with PBS. SYTOX Green (2 \u00b5M) was then added and incubated for 15 min in the dark, and the mixture was centrifuged and washed with PBS to remove any residual background fluorescence. Finally, the suspension was dropped on a slide and observed with a CLSM (ZeissLSM800, Jena, Germany) (32).\n\n## Laurdan staining\nMRSA ATCC 43300 was overnight cultures and diluted 1:1,000 with TSB. The bacteria were incubated at 37\u2103 until OD630 = 1.0, and the bacterial suspension was co-incubated with Laurdan (10 \u00b5M) for 10 min in the dark. Then, the stained bacterial suspension was washed twice with 1 \u00d7 PBS and mixed with equal volumes of TAF. After 30 min at room temperature, the fluorescence intensity of Laurdan was determined with \u03bbex/\u03bbem = 350/435 nm and 350/490 nm, respectively. Membrane fluidity was quantified by the Laurdan generalized polarization (GP) index according to the following equation (33):\n\n## Metabolic activity determination\nThe metabolic activity of the bacteria was assessed according to the method reported by Wang et al. with minor modifications (34). Briefly, S. aureus in the log phase was washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS and diluted to 0.5 McF in the presence of serial concentrations of TAF. After incubation at 37\u00b0C 180 rpm for 1 h, 90 \u00b5L of the bacterial suspension with 10 \u00b5L AlamarBlue was further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. Metabolic conversion of resazurin to pink reduction products was evaluated by measuring A570 nm.\n\n## All-atom molecular dynamics simulations\nMD simulations were performed according to our previous method by CHARMM-GUI software (35). We established a lipid bimolecular model using a dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol) (DOPG) at a ratio of 7:3. Correspondingly, a 7:3 ratio of 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and cholesterol was used to imitate the mammalian lipid bilayer as a control (36). In brief, structural information was downloaded from NCBI, 500 ns equilibrium simulation and MD were performed by Gromacs 2018.4 software. The simulation results were visualized by the Gromacs and VMD programs.\n\n## Tandem mass tags (TMT) quantitative proteomics analysis\nProtein preparation was performed with some modifications according to the method of Zheng et al. (37). S. aureus ATCC 43300 was grown to OD630 = 0.2, TAF with a final concentration of 1/2 \u00d7 MIC was added and the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm for 2 h. DMSO (1%, vol/vol) was used as a negative control. The sediment was then washed 3 times with 1 \u00d7 PBS and placed into liquid nitrogen for 15 min and subsequently stored at \u221280\u00b0C.\nProteins were extracted according to the procedure of Liu et al. (38). Briefly, bacteria were lysed with SDT lysis buffer (4% SDS, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6), and proteins were digested by trypsin and quantified with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, USA). The digested peptides were desalted with a C18 Extraction Disk (3 M Empore) and enriched by vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in formic acid. TMT mass spectrometry analysis was performed on Thermo Q Exactivetm HF-x. Protein sequence information was obtained from the UniProt database, and raw data were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer/Spectronaut. Using R software, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were considered as a P value of < 0.05 and |fold change| of \u22651.5. Gene Ontology (GO), InterPro (IPR), and subcellular were analyzed using GSEA (gsea-3.0) enrichment (39). All the raw data and the corresponding txt files have been deposited in ProteomeXchange via the iProX partner repository (https://www.iprox.cn//page/project.html?id=IPX0006384000) with a data set identifier of IPX0006384000.\n\n## Mouse subcutaneous abscess model\nAll animal-related procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (NO. CSU-2022\u20130599). ICR female mice with 6\u20138 weeks and 23\u201327 g were purchased from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co. The back hair of the mice was shaved using a chemical hair removal agent. Log phase cultures of S. aureus ATCC 43300 were washed with sterile saline and resuspended. One hundred microliters of bacterial suspension containing 1 \u00d7 107 CFU was injected subcutaneously into the back. After 1 h of infection, mice were randomly divided into three groups (n = 6) and were respectively treated with 20 mg/kg TAF, 30 mg/kg TAF, and 1% (vol/vol) DMSO (vehicle group) by subcutaneous injection. After 24 h of treatment, the mice were euthanized and the infected skin was excised. The tissues were homogenized with 1 mL saline and then performed CFU count (28). Meanwhile, the skin was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for up to 24 h for histological analysis. After dehydration with a series of alcohol concentrations and replacement with xylene, the tissue was paraffin-embedded and sectioned. After dewaxing, separate hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Masson\u2019s trichrome staining were performed. In addition, according to the reagent manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Servicebio, Wuhan, China), interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were performed and observed under an upright fluorescence microscope (Nikon E100, Japan) (40).\n\nThe in vivo toxicity assay was performed using 6\u20138 weeks of female ICR mice with intraperitoneal injection. For the time-survival assay, mice were randomly divided into four groups: vehicle group, 100 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 40 mg/kg of TAF. The survival and emotional state were tracked daily for 7 days following the injection. For in-depth in vivo toxicity assessment, mice were randomly divided into a vehicle group and 30 mg/kg of the TAF-treated group, after 24-h treatment, whole blood and serum were collected for hematological analysis (BC-5000vet hematology analyzer, Mindray, Shenzhen, China) and biochemical marker determination (Labospect 003 automatic biochemical analyzer, Hitachi, Japan). Finally, the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys were excised and stained for H&E observation (28).\n\n## Statistical analysis\nThe experiments were repeated three times independently. Data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 8.0 and presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The Student\u2019s t-test was used to calculate P values for comparisons between two groups, and one-way ANOVA was used to analyze data between multiple groups. P < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.\n\n## Bactericidal activity of TAF against \nWe carried out high-throughput screening using the MRSA-type strain USA300 to explore promising antibacterial molecules. The workflow of high-throughput screening is shown in Fig. 1A. Based on the results of three-round screening, we finally selected TAF for an in-depth study. The molecular structure formula of TAF is shown in Fig. 1B. TAF exhibited effective bactericidal activity against type strains of both MRSA and MSSA with MICs and MBCs of 8 \u00b5g/mL and 16\u201364 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. TAF also showed similar bactericidal activity against S. aureus clinical isolates with MICs and MBCs of 8 \u00b5g/mL and 16\u201332 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. In addition, TAF exhibited a bactericidal effect against S. epidermidis and Enterococcus with MICs of 4\u20138 \u00b5g/mL, and MBCs of 8\u201364 \u00b5g/mL. However, no antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed with MICs more than 64 \u00b5g/mL (Table 1).\nFurthermore, the bactericidal kinetics of TAF were assessed. As shown in Fig. 2A, even sub-MIC (1/2 \u00d7 MIC) of TAF exhibited an effective growth-inhibiting effect against S. aureus within 24-h incubation. 1 \u00d7 MIC of TAF could significantly reduce the bacterial counts to the limit of detection within 8-h treatment (Fig. 2B). And TAF equal to or greater than 2 \u00d7 MIC killed bacteria completely within 4 h in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). By resistance inducing assay, sub-MIC of conventional antibiotics of CIP and RFP revealed a 16- to 32- and 128-fold increase in MICs within 15 days of treatment against S. aureus ATCC 43300, USA300, and ATCC 25923, respectively. However, the MICs of TAF still remained at the initial value during the entire process (Fig. 2C). In addition, the induced CIP- and RFP-resistant S. aureus also exhibited susceptibility to TAF with MICs of 8\u201316 \u03bcg/mL (Fig. 2D). Next, the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate the combinational antibacterial activity between TAF and conventional antibiotics. A partial synergistic antimicrobial effect was observed between TAF and gentamicin with FICI of 0.75. However, there were no beneficial synergistic effects found when TAF was combined with other conventional antibiotics such as tetracycline, ampicillin, and cefazolin (Table 2).\n\n## Antimicrobial activity of TAF against \nPersister cells were constructed as previously reported by Kim et al. (36). Although the persister cells were highly tolerant to conventional antibiotics of VAN, DAP, and CIP (Fig. 3A), TAF could kill stationary-phased persister cells of MRSA in a dose- and time-dependent manner. For example, 8 \u00d7 MIC of TAF could reduce the CFU counts of persister cells (including ATCC 43300 and USA300) from 8 to 5\u20136 Log10 CFU/mL after 6-h incubation (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, by using CV staining, the anti-biofilm effects of TAF were measured. TAF significantly inhibits the biofilm formation of MRSA ATCC 43300 at the concentration of 1 \u00d7 MIC. It could completely inhibit the biofilm formation at a concentration equal to or greater than 2 \u00d7 MIC (Fig. 3B). In addition, 1/2 \u00d7 MIC of TAF showed biofilm-eradicating effects against the preformed biofilms of MRSA. The biofilm biomass was dramatically reduced in the presence of 16 \u00d7 MIC TAF (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, the results of planktonic cell counting showed that the method of establishing biofilm was reasonable, and TAF could effectively inhibit the number of viable bacteria while biofilm formation, and also kill the planktonic cells on the preformed biofilm (Fig. 3C)\n\n## Antibacterial mechanism of TAF\nAfter 1-h treatment with TAF, the EM images of S. aureus demonstrated obvious differences. TEM images indicated that TAF-treated cells showed mesosome-like structures with cell membrane rupture and intracellular contents leaked, whereas the control group cells showed clear and intact structures. Similarly, the SEM images exhibited varying degrees of membrane crinkling and collapse after TAF treatment (Fig. 4A). Based on these morphological changes, we hypothesized that the cell envelope might be the target of TAF. After the addition of peptidoglycan, a main cell wall component, the MIC of TAF against S. aureus was not altered, indicating that the cell wall was not targeted by TAF (Table S1). As we expected, the fluorescence intensity of the membrane-specific probe SYTOX Green was increased in a concentration-dependent manner within 30 min in the presence of TAF as the cell membrane disruptor melittin (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the CLSM observation showed the TAF-treated bacterial cells were largely stained with SYTOX Green (Fig. 4D). Using DiSC3(5) staining, the fluorescence intensity of TAF-treated bacteria gradually decreased in a concentration-dependent manner within 5 min, indicating that TAF polarized the cell membrane (Fig. 4C). To imitate the cell membrane disrupting by TAF, we established an MD model. As shown in Fig. 4E, TAF was uptake onto the surface of the bacterial membrane within the first 10 ns of the MD simulation, and the amino groups of TAF formed a hydrogen bond with the phosphate group in the DOPC to anchor TAF to the simulated surface. Subsequently, TAF gets closer to the centroid of the membrane and penetrates the membrane after a few hundred nanoseconds, eventually binding stably in the outer leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer (Movie S1). As we expected, TAF does not interact with mammalian-mimetic lipid bilayers (Movie S2). To further investigate the affinity of TAF for phospholipid membranes and the driving force to penetrate the membranes, we calculated and analyzed the binding energies. As shown in Fig. 4F, at the beginning of the simulation, the affinity of TAF for 7DOPC/3DOPG phospholipid membranes increased rapidly, indicating that TAF can bind to bacterial membranes rapidly and then enter the interior of membranes by constant extrusion. This process is further demonstrated by reduced centroid and increased number of hydrogen bonds between TAF and 7DOPC/3DOPG phospholipid membranes. As the simulation progresses, the distance between TAF and bacterial phospholipid membrane decreases rapidly, indicating that TAF can adsorb on the surface of the phospholipid membrane quickly and basically tends to be stabilized after 100 ns, with an average value of 1.02 \u00b1 0.23 nm after 300 ns. While in the 7POPC/3cholesterol system, TAF was not stably bound to the phospholipid membrane, with an average value of 3.84 \u00b1 0.64 nm after 300 ns (Fig. 4H). As shown in Fig. 4I, the number of hydrogen bonding of TAF to 7DOPC/3DOPG phospholipid membranes is greater, which may be more favorable for the binding of TAF to phospholipid membranes. At the same time, the insertion of TAF caused a significant change in bilayer thickness. By contrast, the mammalian bilayer thickness was still kept unchanged (Fig. 4G). The three-dimensional binding mode revealed that in addition to the amino group of TAF forming hydrogen bonds, the aromatic ring with strong rigidity and hydrophobicity penetrates deeply into the phospholipid membrane in the 7DOPC/3DOPG phospholipid membrane system and forms a strong hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic bonds of phospholipid molecules, which not only stabilizes the binding but also disturbs the stability of phospholipid molecules (Fig. 4J). Subsequently, we investigated the membrane fluidity after TAF treatment using Laurdan, a membrane-sensitive probe. The results showed that the Laurdan GP of S. aureus decreased gradually in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of TAF, suggesting that TAF may permeate into the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and cause changes in membrane fluidity (Fig. 4K). Oxidative damage usually disrupts the bacterial structure and inhibits intracellular protein activity, which may lead to bacterial death (41). In this study, by using probe H2DCFDA, we found TAF-enhanced ROS levels of bacteria in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Subsequently, the specific components of ROS were determined, including superoxide anion (O2\u2022\u2212), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH). As shown in Fig. 5B and D, the levels of H2O2 and \u2022OH significantly increased after TAF treatment. In addition, the antibacterial activity of TAF was also reduced with the MIC of 32 \u00b5g/mL in the presence of exogenous glutathione (a ROS scavenger) (Table S1). Subsequently, by using AlamarBlue staining, the metabolic activity of S. aureus was also found to be significantly hindered by TAF (Fig. 5F).\nFurthermore, proteomic changes in S. aureus were analyzed after exposure to TAF. The subcellular localization of DEPs exhibited 16.67% of the DEPs were found in cytoplasm protein, 26.19% in cell membrane protein, and 57.14% in extracellular protein (Fig. 6A). A total of 127 DEPs were found in TAF-treated group, 33 of which were upregulated and 94 were downregulated (Fig. 6B). Notably, a total of 27 core enrichments were identified in cell membrane protein, and the shape of the leader subset appeared in the ES chart with ES = 0.22, indicating that the TAF-trea",
