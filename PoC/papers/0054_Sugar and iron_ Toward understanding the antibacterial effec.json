  "full_text": "## Introduction\nIt is estimated that 23,000 people a year die from infections of antibiotic-resistant bacteria [1]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Enterobacteriaceae are among the three most urgent of these antibiotic-resistant threats [1]. Among many approaches for fighting the \u201csuper-wicked\u201d problem of antibiotic resistance [2], one is the development of novel antibacterial agents, especially drugs with new mechanisms of action, particularly against these \u201curgent threat\u201d pathogens [1,3].\nNovel antibacterial therapies can be found by repurposing off-patent drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for other treatments. This repurposing allows faster movement through the drug development pipeline. One promising repurposed drug is ciclopirox, an off-patent antifungal agent with a good safety profile and a long and successful history of antifungal use [4]. Despite being used for over 30 years, no fungal resistance has been identified [4,5]. Additionally, sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciclopirox failed to induce resistance in Candida albicans, even after six months of culturing (discussed in [4]).\nDespite only being marketed for topical use, in part because of the large quantity of antibiotics on the market at the time of its development, ciclopirox has been assessed for other purposes, including systemically [6\u201310]. Acute toxicity studies performed in mice and rats revealed LD50s ranging from 1,700 to > 2,500 mg/kg (oral and subcutaneous), 71\u201379 mg/kg (intravenous), and 83\u2013172 mg/kg (intraperitoneal). Chronic and subacute toxicity studies showed that oral administration of 10 mg/kg/day for three months was well tolerated in rats and dogs, although long-term oral doses of \u226530 mg/kg/day resulted in toxicity in dogs. In a phase I study to treat patients with hematologic malignances, daily doses of 40 mg/m2 ciclopirox olamine were well tolerated, although gastrointestinal toxicities occurred in patients receiving 80 mg/m2 four times a day [11]. These favorable outcomes have led to ciclopirox currently being investigated as a treatment for multiple types of cancer [11\u201319], diabetes mellitus [20\u201322], herpes simplex virus [23], congenital erythropoietic porphyria [24] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [25,26].\nThe excellent safety profile and lack of fungal resistance also make ciclopirox a prime candidate for repurposing as an antibacterial agent [27\u201329]. Ciclopirox blocks growth of A. baumannii, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae clinical isolates independently of antibiotic resistance status [27]. In particular, thirty non-clonal E. coli isolates with a range of antibiotic resistance phenotypes (from pan-antibiotic susceptible to resistant to 1\u20138 classes of antibiotics), with ciprofloxacin MICs ranging from 0.008 to 500 \u03bcg/mL, were all inhibited by 5\u201315 \u03bcg/mL of ciclopirox [27]. This finding suggests that ciclopirox has a novel drug target in these gram-negative bacteria for which bacteria have not yet developed resistance.\nCiclopirox has iron chelation properties, but the mechanism of inhibition differs between humans and fungi. In yeast, ciclopirox iron chelation leads to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, reduced expression and activity of catalase, suspected loss of activity in iron-dependent enzymes, and cell death through production of reactive oxygen species [30\u201332]. In C. albicans, however, 97% of ciclopirox is found bound to cell structures and organelles and the drug modifies particle distribution within the plasma membrane of both C. albicans and dermatophytes (discussed in [32]). As an HIV infection treatment, ciclopirox binds iron in the active site of deoxyhypusine hydroxylase to prevent post-translational modification of lysine residues into the rare amino acid hypusine [26]. Hypusine is only found in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5a), and is essential in some higher eukaryotes [26,33,34]. Without mature eIF5a, HIV-infected cells are less able to suppress intrinsic apoptotic pathways, causing the infected cells to undergo apoptosis [26]. As an anticancer treatment, ciclopirox iron sequestration leads to inhibition of Wnt signaling and cell cycle progression, the latter due to sequestering iron from ribonucleotide reductase and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase [11].\nSome information is known about ciclopirox as an antibacterial agent. Unlike yeast [30\u201332], bacteria grown in ciclopirox do not become more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress [27]. Excessive iron in the growth medium (4\u201316 times the concentration found in human serum) rescues E. coli growth in otherwise inhibitory concentrations of ciclopirox [27]. E. coli grown in sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciclopirox have decreased levels of both the highly variable oligosaccharide O-antigen component and the more conserved polysaccharide core component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [27]. Furthermore, from a screen of 4,267 gene overexpression plasmids in the E. coli ASKA library, the overexpression of galE rescues growth of E. coli in ciclopirox [27]. UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, GalE, functions in the galactose salvage pathway to convert UDP-glucose into UDP-galactose. Without GalE, exogenous galactose is required for completion of the outer core oligosaccharide and production of O-antigen side chains [35]. Ciclopirox, however, does not directly inhibit purified GalE activity [27].\nContinuing to expand our understanding of the phenotypic changes resulting from ciclopirox treatment could potentially lead to identification of the ciclopirox mechanism of action in bacteria. In turn, this mechanism could be exploited as a new drug target, or lead to identification of other targets in the same pathway. Here we screened gene deletion strains from the E. coli Keio collection for decreased ciclopirox minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) required to block growth and identified two pathways affected by the drug. One involves utilization (synthesis and transport) of the siderophore, enterobactin, and the other involves synthesis of the polysaccharide, enterobacterial common antigen.\n\n## Chemicals and reagents\nCalcium chloride, hydrochloric acid, anhydrous dextrose (D-glucose), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), light mineral oil, sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, agar, and sodium phosphate dibasic were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, USA). Sodium molybdate, sodium nitrite, and ciclopirox were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Dallas, USA). Ammonium chloride, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, dimethylformamide, iron (III) chloride, 1,10-phenanthroline, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Mueller Hinton (MH) broth, tryptic soy broth (TSB), tryptone, and casamino acids were from DIFCO (Sparks, USA). Potassium phosphate monobasic was from Macron Fine Chemicals (Center Valley, USA). Ethanol was purchased from Decon Labs, Inc. (King of Prussia, USA). A QIAprepSpin MiniPrep Kit was purchased from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA). Yeast extract and tris base was purchased from Millipore Sigma (Burlington, USA). Eiken agar was purchased from Eiken Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Kern River crude (13 Deg API) oil was provided by Donald S. Mims (Chevron, Houston, TX USA).\nAmpicillin, ciclopirox, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol and 1,10-phenanthroline stocks were stored at -20\u00b0 C. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin were stored in H2O at stock concentration of 50 mg/mL. Ciclopirox was stored in DMSO at a concentration of 100 mM. Chloramphenicol was stored in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. 1,10-phenanthroline was stored in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 100 mM.\n\n## Bacterial strains and plasmids\nThe E. coli Keio knock-out strains, BW25113 (the isogenic parent strain), and E. coli strain AG1 containing ASKA plasmids were obtained from the National BioResource Project Center [36,37]. A. baumannii strain ATTC17978, E. coli strain ATTC BAA-1743 SMS-3-5, K. pneumoniae strain ATTC 11296, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain ATTC 27853 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, USA). Clinical isolate E. coli ELZ4486 was taken from a collection of clinical isolates previously described [38\u201340]. E. coli strains CAG 18556, CAG 18565, CAG 18619, and the isogenic parent MG1655 were generously provided by Dr. Carol A. Gross.\n\n## Bacterial growth media\nFour different growth media were used for these experiments. For measuring antibiotic susceptibility and siderophore production, bacteria were grown in MH. To measure siderophore production under low iron conditions, cells were grown in M9 minimal medium (M9). For the biofilm formation assay, cells were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB). All other experiments were performed using lysogeny broth (LB).\n\n## Antibiotic susceptibility determinations\nMinimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured using a broth dilution protocol performed in accordance with Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [41]. The protocol was modified to include a wider range of drug concentrations (0.125\u20136 \u03bcg/mL for ampicillin, 5\u201320 \u03bcg/mL for ciclopirox, 0.005\u20130.05 \u03bcg/mL for ciprofloxacin, and 5\u201315 \u03bcg/mL for 1,10-phenanthroline). Each MIC measurement was done at least in triplicate. In addition to reporting the MIC ranges, we also, when relevant, report averaged MIC values and assessed statistical relevance using the Student\u2019s t-test.\n\n## Keio knock-out strain complementation with ASKA plasmid\nOvernight cultures of Keio strains \u0394tonB and \u0394fepA as well as E. coli strain AG1 containing either the empty ASKA plasmid (pCA24N) or ASKA plasmids encoding the tonB or fepA genes were diluted 1:100 into fresh LB medium and grown shaking at 37\u00b0 C for 2 hours. 1.5 mL of culture was transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 1 minute to pellet cells. Supernatant was removed via aspiration and cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of cold 100 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. 25 ng of each ASKA plasmid, which were purified using the QIAprep Spin MiniPrep Kit, were added to each tube. Each Keio strain received the empty ASKA plasmid or the plasmid containing the complementing gene. Cells were incubated for 1 hour on ice, placed for 5 minutes in a water bath at 37\u00b0 C, and returned to ice. 1 mL of LB medium was added to each tube and the tubes were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0 C. Cells were centrifuged for 1 minute and the supernatant was removed. Pellets were resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of LB medium and then spread onto LB agar plates containing 20 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol to select for colonies containing the ASKA plasmid. Plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0 C.\n\n## Siderophore quantification\nOvernight bacteria cultures were diluted 1:100 in MH medium and grown, with shaking, at 37\u00b0 C to an OD600 = 0.1. Cultures were then diluted 1:100 into fresh medium, and grown, shaking, at 37\u00b0 C for 17 hours. Cell densities were measured at OD600. One mL of culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was used for the chemical assays. To test the effect of drugs on siderophore production, 5 \u03bcg/mL of ciclopirox or 1.5 \u03bcg/mL of 1,10-phenanthroline was added to MH during the 17 hours of shaking growth. In low iron conditions M9 was used instead of MH.\nCatechol siderophores were quantified using a slightly modified Arnow assay [42]. 1 mL of overnight cell culture was centrifuged. 400 \u03bcL of supernatant was combined with equal parts 0.5 M HCl, nitrite-molybdate reagent (10% sodium nitrite, 10% sodium molybdate), and 1 M NaOH. The mixture was shaken after each reagent was added. The resulting mixture was stable for 1 hour, with an absorption maximum of 510 nm. The absorbance at 510 nm was divided by the OD600 of the culture and the ratio was used as a measurement of the amount of catechol siderophore per cell density.\n\n## Bacterial swarming\nMotility was measured under conditions that are inducive to bacterial swarming. Thus the surface motility for P. aeruginosa and E. coli is considered bacterial swarming while the movement of non-flagellated strains is referred to as surface motility. Swarming and surface motility was assessed on LB growth medium with 0.5% glucose and 0.5% Eiken agar. For the clinical isolate E. coli, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, some of which were robust swarmers, regular 0.5% bacto agar was used. For some experiments, as indicated, various concentrations of ciclopirox (\u03bcg/mL), 1,10-phenanthroline (\u03bcg/mL), or ferric chloride (\u03bcM) were added to the agar following sterilization. 25 mL liquid agar were poured per plate. The agar was allowed to solidify with the lid slightly opened for 2 hours. Overnight bacteria cultures were diluted 1:100 in LB growth medium and grown, with shaking at 37\u00b0 C, to an OD600 \u2248 0.6. Eight \u03bcL of culture were inoculated on the agar surface at the center of each plate without piercing. Plates were incubated overnight for ~18 hours, uninverted.\nSwarmed bacteria were photographed and analyzed using the Image J software. Images were converted to black and white. The threshold of the image was adjusted to only read the visual cell growth as black pixilation, as given as a percentage of the total area of the plate measured in centimeters. The swarmed area was calculated by multiplying the total area in centimeters by the percentage of the plate with visual cell growth.\n\n## Biofilm forming assay\nOvernight bacterial cultures were diluted 1:100 in TSB and placed in a 96-well plate. Increasing concentrations of ciclopirox, diluted into TSB for a final volume of 100 \u03bcL, were added per well. Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Medium was then removed and plates washed three times with 150 \u03bcL per well of PBS. 100 \u03bcL of PBS and 10 \u03bcL of 5 mg/mL MTT were added to each well and incubated for 4 hours at 37\u00b0 C. 100 \u03bcL of extraction buffer (20% SDS [wt./vol.], 50% dimethylformamide in water, pH = 4.7) were added to each well and the plates were incubated 18 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Absorbance values at 560 nm indicated viable biofilm forming cells.\n\n## Drop collapse assay\nOvernight bacterial cultures were diluted 1:100 in MH growth medium and grown, with shaking, at 37\u00b0 C to an OD600 = 0.1. Cultures were then diluted 1:100 into fresh MH medium with increasing concentrations of ciclopirox (\u03bcg/mL), and grown, shaking, at 37\u00b0 C for 17 hours. Cell densities were measured at OD600. One mL of culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was separated from the cell pellet. An adapted drop collapse assay was used [43]. Two \u03bcL of mineral oil were spotted on the underside of a 96-well microtiter plate lid and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour at room temperature. 5 \u03bcL of supernatant were added to the thin layer of mineral oil formed at each spot. The shape of the drops was inspected after 1 minute. Biosurfactants result in flatter drops.\n\n## Oil displacement assay\nOvernight bacteria cultures were diluted 1:100 in MH growth medium and grown, with shaking, at 37\u00b0 C to an OD600 = 0.1. Cultures were then diluted 1:100 into fresh MH medium with increasing concentrations of ciclopirox (\u03bcg/mL), and grown, shaking, at 37\u00b0 C for 17 hours. Cell densities were measured at OD600. One mL of culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was separated from the cell pellet. An adapted oil displacement assay was used [44,45]. A 150 mm petri dish was placed over a 1 cm2 grid drawn on paper. The dish was filled with 42 mL of distilled water, and swirled slightly to ensure coverage of the entire surface. Using a Pasteur pipette, a drop of viscous crude oil (Kern River crude (13 Deg API)) was placed on the surface of the water, allowing a thin membrane of oil to form. Ten \u03bcL of supernatant was dotted onto the thin oil surface and the displaced oil was measured. Triton X-100 served as a positive control.\n\n## Statistical analyses\nA Student\u2019s T test was used to assess significance for MIC measurements, siderophore production, swarming, and biofilm production. For MICs and siderophore quantification, results were considered significant when p < 0.005 and, because of the vastly increased variability of the assay, results for swarming and biofilm production were considered significant with p < 0.05.\n\n## Effect of gene deletions on ciclopirox MICs\nIn our previous work we found that overexpression of galE rescues E. coli growth in the presence of otherwise inhibitory concentrations of ciclopirox and that the deletion of any one of a number of additional genes in the galactose salvage pathway lowers ciclopirox MICs [27]. Because GalE is not the direct ciclopirox target [27], we inferred that ciclopirox affects LPS [27] to render bacteria more vulnerable to the availability of sugar monomers provided by the galactose salvage pathway. Because ciclopirox binds iron, it was important to distinguish whether the mutant strains were affected by ciclopirox binding iron or through a different mechanism.\nWe selected a group of 96 mutant strains from the Keio collection of 3,985 deletions of non-essential genes in K-12 E. coli [36,46]. The deleted genes were involved in sugar metabolism, LPS synthesis, iron salvage, two-component regulation, and synthesis of the translation factor elongation factor P (S1 Table).\nForty-three of these mutant strains had significantly lower (p < 0.005) ciclopirox MICs than the isogenic parent strain (S1 Table). In the Keio mutant collection the replacement of each gene is with the kanamycin resistance gene [46]. By measuring ciclopirox MICs in strains CAG18556, CAG18565, and CAG18619, containing the kanamycin resistance gene, compared to the isogenic parent MG1655, we demonstrated that this gene itself had no effect on the ciclopirox MIC (data not shown). In addition, the MIC was restored in the \u0394fepA and \u0394tonB Keio strains complemented with the ASKA plasmids containing fepA or tonB respectfully (data not shown). Therefore, the MIC changes we saw resulted from the deletion of the genes of interest.\nTo separate the effects of iron chelation by ciclopirox from additional antibiotic effects, we measured 1,10-phenanthroline MICs in the 43 mutants with lower ciclopirox MICs, as 1,10-phenanthroline chelates metal (including iron). Nineteen of these strains also had lower (p < 0.005) 1,10-phenanthroline MICs (S1 Table). To distinguish those gene deletions specifically affected by ciclopirox from those involved with resistance to antibiotics in general, we compared our gene list to previously published data of 283 Keio deletion strains more susceptible to at least one of 14 tested antibiotics [47]. Nine of our 43 strains appeared on this list (S1 Table).\nTo assess whether antibiotics in general affected any of the mutant strains on our list, we measured the ampicillin and ciprofloxacin MICs for 15 representative strains from each biochemical pathway (one each from each pathway with a change in the ciclopirox MIC but no change in the 1,10-phenanthroline MIC) and verified that these deletion mutants were not generally affected by antibiotics (S2 Table). These efforts resulted in 21 deletion mutants with lower ciclopirox MICs that could not be explained by response to iron chelation or antibiotics.\n\n## Biochemical pathways affected by ciclopirox\nOf the 21 deletion mutants specifically affected by ciclopirox, four (\u0394galK, \u0394galM, \u0394galP, \u0394ugd) are from the Leloir pathway for galactose salvage. This pathway allows E. coli to utilize external galactose for metabolism and as a subunit precursor for synthesis of glycolipids [48\u201350]. Two of the 21 deletion mutants (\u0394waaB and \u0394waaO) strains lack the genes that encode proteins involved in the synthesis of the structurally conserved sugar core region of LPS [51]. In particular, waaB encodes UDP-D-galactose (glucosyl) LPS-1, 6-D-galactosyltransferase, and waaO encodes UDP-D-glucose:(glucosyl) LPS \u03b1-1,3-glucosyltransferase. These two enzymes work together to add a galactose and glucose, respectively, to the first glucose residue in the outer core of LPS [51]. These findings agree with our previous data [27] that showed disrupting synthesis of core LPS or galactose salvage increases cell susceptibility to ciclopirox but extend the data to show, importantly, that these effects are independent of iron chelation.\nBW25113, the isogenic parent strain for the Keio collection, does not express the highly variable O-antigen component of LPS as a consequence of disruption of the gene encoding rhamnosyltransferase needed for O-antigen unit assembly [52]. Thus, most BW25113 mutants tested that encode proteins involved in this aspect of LPS assembly had no change in the ciclopirox MICs compared to the parent strain, as expected. The strain with deleted wzzB, which encodes the protein that regulates the chain length of O-antigen [53], may have caused a slight MIC change. It is not yet clear how chain-length regulators interact with other O-antigen assembly proteins [54] and it is, thus, unclear why \u0394wzzB had a slightly lower ciclopirox MIC than the isogenic parent strain.\nFive strains (\u0394rffH, \u0394wecG, \u0394wecF, \u0394wecA, and \u0394wzzE) are mutants of gene products involved in the synthesis and/or transport of ECA, a surface glycolipid of repeating trisaccharide units found in Enterobacteriaceae (Fig 1A and 1B). The rff gene family products are responsible for ECA trisaccharide subunit synthesis [55,56]. In particular, the gene wecA encodes UDP-N-acetylglucosamine\u2014undecaprenyl-phosphate N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase, a protein that initiates biosynthesis of ECA subunits by transferring N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate onto the lipid carrier C55 isoprenoid lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate upon which the remaining subunit is assembled [54]. The gene wzzE encodes enterobacterial common antigen polysaccharide co-polymerase, the protein responsible for regulating the length of ECA polysaccharide chains [54]. The majority of gene deletion mutants from the ECA synthesis/transport pathway had lower ciclopirox MICs than the parent strain. Therefore, ciclopirox may affect the synthesis or transport of ECA.\nWhereas the majority of ECA is found covalently linked directly to the phosphoglyceride or is found in the periplasm in a cyclic form, it also can be attached to the core LPS in strains that do not produce O-antigen, such as the BW25113 based Keio knock-out mutant strains (Fig 1B) [54]. Without waaL, the gene encoding O-antigen ligase, bacteria are unable to attach ECA subunits to core LPS [61,62]. The \u0394waaL strain showed no significant change in ciclopirox MIC, suggesting that it is the loss of the ECA directly attached to the bacterial membrane (and potentially the cyclic ECA) that increases sensitivity of this mutant to ciclopirox.\nFour mutant strains (\u0394fepA, \u0394fepD, \u0394entA, and \u0394entS) with decreased ciclopirox MICs are from pathways for synthesis or transport of enterobactin, a siderophore secreted by bacteria to salvage iron, yet these mutants had no effect on 1,10- phenanthroline MICs (Fig 1A and 1C). The ent gene family (entA, entB, entC, entE, and entF) encode the proteins responsible for synthesis of enterobactin (entA in particular encodes 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate dehydrogenase) [57]. The protein encoded by entS is responsible for transporting synthesized enterobactin across the inner membrane en route to leaving the cell [58,59,63]. The fep gene family (fepA, fepB, fepC, fepD, and fepG) encodes the system that transports enterobactin bound to iron into the cell where the enterobactin is hydrolyzed by enterochelin esterase (encoded by fes) [57,60,64]. FepA, in particular, is the outer membrane gated channel protein, which transports enterobactin using the proton motive force facilitated by the TonB protein complex (encoded by tonB, exbB, and exbD). FepD is a subunit of the ABC transporter complex used to transport enterobactin across the inner membrane. All gene deletion strains in these pathways had lower ciclopirox MICs, signifying that cells unable to use enterobactin to scavenge iron are more sensitive to ciclopirox.\nWe expected to see lower ciclopirox MICs for deletions of enterobactin synthesis and transport genes compared to the parent strain because disruption of iron salvage pathways will make bacteria sensitive to lower iron concentrations and ciclopirox is an iron chelator that will lower free iron concentrations in the bacterial growth medium. Yet, neither the deletion of genes encoding proteins required for transport of the siderophores ferrichrome or citrate [60] nor the gene encoding the master ferric uptake regulator, fur, which controls siderophore synthesis [65], resulted in lower ciclopirox MICs (S1 Table). The \u0394fecE mutant strain had a statistically relevant higher ciclopirox MIC. Thus, our further research focused on how ciclopirox interacts with transport of the siderophore enterobactin, and not transport of other siderophores, since the ciclopirox MICs only changed when enterobactin (and not other siderophore) transport genes were deleted. This result may occur because enterobactin is the primary siderophore utilized by E. coli [66].\nIn the \u0394fur mutant strain, where there is increased production of enterobactin and its associated transport proteins, there was no change in ciclopirox MIC (S1 Table). This finding demonstrates that neither an increase in enterobactin concentration or enterobactin transport proteins alleviate the antimicrobial activity of ciclopirox. Therefore, ciclopirox may interfere with enterobactin transport into the bacteria across the membrane, such that bacteria lacking transport proteins are more sensitive to the drug but overexpression of the transport system and enterobactin is not enough to cause resistance.\nThe strain lacking fetB also had a lower ciclopirox MIC. The putative ABC-type transporter, FetAB, is an iron exporter, which reduces oxidative stress by mediating iron homeostasis. FetB encodes the inner membrane metal resistance protein [67]. If ciclopirox targets the exporter, we would expect either mutant to have higher ciclopirox MICs. Deleting fetA, however, caused no change in ciclopirox MIC, indicating, perhaps, that FetB has an additional (unknown) role in E. coli.\nTwo genes (phoQ, soxS) correspond to two-component transcriptional regulators, which respond to different environmental stresses at the bacterial cell surface (S1 Table). The PhoPQ system (encoded by phoP and phoQ) responds to low magnesium concentrations or antimicrobial peptides whereas the SoxRS system (soxR, soxS) responds to superoxide stress [63,68,69]. The \u0394phoP strain had a lower ciclopirox MIC compared to the parent strain, but was excluded from the final set of deletion mutants as it was also more sensitive than the isogenic parent to six other antibiotics [47]. The PhoPQ system positively regulates LPS modification by controlling the expression of LPS modifying enzymes [68]. Meanwhile, as part of the superoxide response, the SoxRS system modifies iron metabolism by inducing expression of fur [63,69]. Changes to LPS and iron metabolism may contribute to the lower ciclopirox MICs of the \u0394phoQ and \u0394soxS strains.\nAlthough the eukaryotic ciclopirox target deoxyhypusine hydroxylase does not have a bacterial homolog, the protein this hydroxylase modifies, eIF5\u03b1, has 64% percent homology with bacterial elongation factor P (EF-P) [34]. As such, we examined the possibility that ciclopirox targets the post-translational modification of EF-P the same way that it targets the modification of eIF5\u03b1 in eukaryotes. Indeed, two strains (\u0394empA, \u0394efp) from this pathway were more susceptible than the isogenic parent strain to ciclopirox but not 1,10-phenanthroline (S1 Table). The gene efp encodes elongation factor P and empA encodes EF-P-lysine lysyltransferase, a protein involved in EF-P lysine residue modification [34]. If ciclopirox inhibits the post-translational modification of EF-P, it would be expected that ciclopirox would not affect the \u0394efp strain, as a strain without EF-P would have nothing to inhibit. For the \u0394efp strain there would be either no change in ciclopirox MIC or a higher MIC but not a lower MIC. Therefore, we must consider other possibilities for why three of the four genes in this pathway increased sensitivity to ciclopirox. These results are most likely a consequence of downstream functions of the deletion of EF-P. EF-P alleviates ribosomal stalling for some proteins with consecutive proline residues, while loss of EF-P affects protein expression and disrupts integrity of the bacterial membrane [34,70]. The lower ciclopirox MIC in the \u0394efp mutant could result from this change in protein expression.\n\n## Ciclopirox stimulates enterobactin production\nAltering the composition of O-antigen leads to decreased siderophore intake in Vibrio anguillarum through a resulting decrease of transport protein in the outer membrane [71]. These findings combined with the fact that ciclopirox affects O-antigen and LPS synthesis [27], led us to hypothesize that ciclopirox treatment increases extracellular concentrations of enterobactin. We further hypothesized that gene deletions in the galactose metabolism or ECA synthesis pathways, in combination with ciclopirox treatment, would increase extracellular concentrations of enterobactin beyond the concentration reached by ciclopirox treatment alone. To test these hypotheses, we measured how ciclopirox affects enterobactin production of E. coli strain BW25113, with or without genes encoding proteins involved in galactose salvage or ECA synthesis, using a modified Arnow assay [42]. As this assay measures siderophores containing catechols, we were unable to distinguish fully formed enterobactin from its fragment precursors, which also can accumulate and bind iron in the growth medium [72].\nWhen the parent strain for the Keio collection (BW25113) was grown in rich growth medium, the addition of a sub-inhibitory concentration of ciclopirox indeed induced enterobactin expression (Fig 2)",
