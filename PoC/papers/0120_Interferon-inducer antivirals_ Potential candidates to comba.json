  "full_text": "## Introduction\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has aroused a worldwide threat and resulted in a growing need for preventive and therapeutic strategies. The infective agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of coronaviruses family, a group of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope. The envelope consists of spike glycoproteins, responsible for the virulence and cell receptor recognition mechanisms, which ultimately enables virus entry into the host cells [1]. Coronaviruses primarily cause zoonotic infections and are categorized into four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, deltacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus [2]. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus responsible for clinical manifestations similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which are also from the genus betacoronavirus [3].\nMultiple studies have uncovered the importance of interferons (IFNs) in effective adaptive immune responses against viral infections at various stages. The key role of IFNs in the induction of antiviral immune responses in coronavirus infections is also well-established [4]. Type I interferons (IFN-II) significantly contribute to the induction of immune cells, particularly antigen presenting cells (APCs), natural killer cells (NKs), T cells, and B cells [5]. While IFN-II are imperative in restricting viral replication through the signaling mechanisms integrated in type I interferon receptors (IFNAR), low levels of IFNs are detected in blood and lung tissue samples of COVID-19 patients [6], [7], implicating the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 on IFN-II induction [8]. Additionally, the cell count of regulatory T cells (Treg) was shown to correlate inversely with the infection severity in SARS-CoV-2 patients [9].\nWhile the early induction of IFN-I inhibits viral replication, it seems that coronaviruses delay IFN-I production through various evasion mechanisms, resulting in a high viral load. This could consequently bring about the late induction of IFN-mediated antiviral responses, which not only is useless in the control and suppression of the viral load, but also would cause tissue damage and inflammatory responses [10]. In this line, in a retrospective cohort study in china, early administration of inhaled aerosolized IFN-\u03b12b was associated with reduced mortality and shorter hospital stay in patients. On the other hand, late administration of inhaled IFN-\u03b12b, resulted in longer hospital stay as well as increased patient mortality [11]. Besides, in a study by Monk et al. at nine sites in UK, inhaled nebulized IFN-\u03b21a (SNG001) was administered in 48 COVID-19 patients, which resulted in a greater improvement on day 15 or 16 than placebo group according to OSCI (ordinal scale for clinical improvement) scale [12].\nAdditionally, a clear concordance between the pathogenesis of the coronaviruses and their ability to antagonize IFN-mediated antiviral responses was found, which seems to have a relation with the rapid replication of the virus and the subsequent proinflammatory overreactions and dysregulation of the immune system [13], [14]. Though, the probable reason for the lower mortality rate of COVID-19 than that of MERS and SARS might also be due to the weaker IFN-antagonizing effect imposed by SARS-CoV-2 [15]. Notably, various studies discovered the impaired IFN-mediated antiviral responses in the elderlies [16], which might be the cause of poor patient prognosis in this group. Moreover, it was suggested that the higher susceptibility of African-American populations to SARS-CoV-2 might be correlated with lower IFN-I production in response to the viral RNA [17].\nThe canonical signaling pathway of JAK/STAT induction by type I and II IFNs was well-established in previous studies [18]. Briefly, in the IFN-I mediated signaling pathway, IFNARs bind to IFN-I resulting in Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) induction, which then phosphorylate the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 2 (STAT2). These phosphorylated factors are then relocated inside the nucleus, where they assemble with interferon -regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), constituting interferon -stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). It ultimately induces the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which plays a significant role in antiviral immune responses [19].\nIt is suggested that the pathogenicity of coronavirus infections highly depends on the virus ability to evade IFN mediated immune responses [20]. Coronaviruses have developed multiple evasion mechanisms to avoid IFN-I induction [19]. SARS-CoV-2, also might have developed similar evasion mechanisms, as suggested by the lack of adequate IFN-I/3 production in the primary bronchial cells, infected cell lines, and a ferret model [7]. Coronaviruses avoid pattern-recognition proteins (PRPs), which are responsible for the induction of proinflammatory reactions and IFN mediated antiviral responses. SARS-CoV-1 form a double membrane vesicle, hiding the dsRNA of the virus [21]. Additionally, several viral non-structural proteins (namely, nsp10, nsp13, nsp14, and nsp16) modify the viral RNA by adding a guanosine cap and methylation at the 5\u2032 end, stunting the receptor sensing mechanisms [22], [23]. Coronaviruses have also developed mechanisms to interfere with IRF3 and membrane protein (M protein). Besides, they can interfere with accessory proteins (open reading frame 4a (ORF4a), ORF4b, and ORF5), which cause suppression of phosphorylation and translocation of IRF3 in MERS-CoV [24]. SARS-CoV-1 interrupts the functions of IRF3 by ORF3b and ORF6 and nucleocapsid protein (N protein) [25], [26]. Human coronaviruses are also able to block IFNAR and interferon-lambda receptor (IFNLR) signaling pathways and suppress ISG effector functions as part of their immune system evasion mechanisms [27], [28]. These mechanisms ultimately antagonize IFN production and might play a similar role in the IFN mediated response delay caused by SARS-CoV-2. In a recently published global study on critical SARS-CoV-2 patients hospitalized due to life-threatening pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, 13 mutated loci were identified in patients with life-threatening influenza or directly connected to influenza susceptibility, all of which play a role in TLR3-, TLR7-, and TLR9-dependent IFN-I induction and amplification pathways. Results from this study identified at least 3.5% of patients aged 17\u201377 with life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 patients had known or novel genetic deficiencies in eight out of 13 candidate loci involved in the TLR3 and TLR7 dependent IFN-I induction and amplification pathways. These mutations consisted of autonomic recessive (AR) IRF7 and IFNAR1 deficiencies or autonomic dominant (AD) TLR3, TICAM1, TBK1, IRF3 deficiencies as known mutations and AD UNC93B1, IRF7, IFNAR1, IFNAR2 deficiencies as novel mutations. Ultimately, these results indicate the role of these genes in IFN-I inductions and amplification pathways, thus highlighting the role of IFN-I in controlling SARS-CoV-2 [29]. Another defect in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients was also reported in a study regarding neutralizing auto-antibodies against IFN-I, demonstrating that at least 10 percent of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia possessed auto-antibodies against IFN-I. This study also concluded that early IFN-\u03b1 therapy might not serve as an effective solution and proposed injected or nebulized IFN-\u03b2 therapy as potential treatment candidates in these patients, due to rare auto-antibodies against IFN-\u03b2 in this patient groups [30].\nAlthough IFN administration is a globally accepted treatment strategy to excite the antiviral immune responses, IFN therapy in the coronavirus-infected cases appears to generate rather controversial results. It seems that IFN therapy in rather early stages of the infection produce effective outcomes, while this strategy shows detrimental outcomes in the severe or later stages of the infection [31], [32]. A recent study reported the effectiveness of using of IFN-I, as a prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2 [15].\nDrug repositioning has recently become an increasingly attractive subject due to the substantially decreased development costs and shorter timeline possibly achieved in this approach than those of conventional drug discovery methods, because of the need for undergoing many years of intensive investigations and phase I-III studies in the latter approach [33]. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, lots of attempts have taken place to find a treatment for this disease through drug repurposing of the licensed or well-studied drugs with antiviral activity.\nThe aim of this study is to briefly review some antiviral drugs and discuss their mechanism of action and impact on IFNs, as potential drug repositioning candidates for COVID-19 treatment.\n\n## Methods\nThe drugvirus web server (http://drugvirus.info/) was utilized in this study (the updated database at 23 May 2020), to find the relation between the antiviral effects of these conventional drugs and their effect on IFN signaling. This website provides data focusing on broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAA) and their target viruses as the main resource for an interactive exploration [34]. The name of each agent along with IFN related keywords including \u201cinterferon\u201d, \u201cISG\u201d, \u201cSTAT3\u201d, \u201cmTOR\u201d, and \u201cSARS\u201d were searched in the PubMed database to find the relevance of the drug\u2019 activity with IFN signaling pathway and its probable effect against SARS-CoV.\n\n## An overview of the findings\nSeveral various categories of drugs present on drugvirus server were shown correlated with IFN signaling pathway, according to the results of our searches. These agents include antibiotic, anticancer, immunosuppressant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), and calcium channel blocker compounds (some are presented in Table 1\n), whose advantages and risks should be taken into account through precise studies, considering a systemic approach [35]. Multiple compounds of this list have already entered COVID-19 clinical trials, though some have been the subject of controversy [36]. The studied compounds will be discussed in the following in two main classes based on their origin: synthetic and natural compounds.Table 1An overview on IFN-inducing effects of the antiviral agents. The clinical trial data was gathered on 17 September 2020. Molecular structures of the following drugs are shown as a representative of their classes; for instance, neomycin for aminoglycosides, idarubicin for anthracyclines, and simvastatin for statins.

However, some of them also possess antiviral effects, such as macrolides, which are a class of antibiotics composed of a large lactone ring (12\u201316 atoms). Macrolides exhibit their antibacterial effect through interfering with protein synthesis in bacteria via binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Many studies have reported the antiviral activity of macrolides against various viruses [87]. Although the antiviral modus operandi of macrolides are not clear, a possible mechanism is through binding to IFNAR1 complex and inducing STAT1/2, IRF7, IRF9, and finally, production of ISGF3 (Fig. 1\n) [40]. There is some evidence that different macrolides may be useful for viral respiratory infections. For instance, clarithromycin was found promising in the treatment of the influenza virus infection. Leucomycin A3 was also active against the influenza virus and enhanced IFN-\u03b1 production [88].Fig. 1The mechanism of action of possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs on the interferon signaling pathway.\nAzithromycin, as a macrolide, could inhibit rhinoviruses (rhinovirus 1B and rhinovirus 16) through potentiating IFN-I signaling. Moreover, azithromycin blocked the cell entry of Ebola virus through an unknown mechanism. It could inhibit the Zika virus infection as well [39], [40]. Both azithromycin and spiramycin showed antiviral effects against enterovirus A71 [89].\nThe most severe cases of influenza A H1N1 are usually associated with a secondary bacterial infection. In a cohort study, Ishaqui et al. showed that a combination of azithromycin and oseltamivir was more beneficial than oseltamivir alone in treating influenza A H1N1 [90]. In vitro studies demonstrated that azithromycin could block internalization of the H1N1 virus into host cells and inactivated the endocytic activity of the newly budded viruses. A single dose of nasal azithromycin reduced the virus load in mice lungs [7].\nAzithromycin antiviral mechanism, theoretically, could be either through activation of I\u03baB-kinase (IKK), IKK-\u03b9/\u03b5, and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) signaling pathway, which leads to IRF stimulation (Fig. 1) or acting on interleukin (IL)-28 and IL-29 receptor complexes [40]. Azithromycin can induce type I and III IFNs (IFN-\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic inducible gene I (RIG-I), and RIG-I-like helicase in bronchial epithelial cells as the antiviral proteins thereby reducing viral load [39], [87], [91]. Moreover, azithromycin increased expression of IL-28 and IL-29. Interestingly, azithromycin can inhibit autophagy in macrophages. It was shown that azithromycin upregulated pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) including IFIH1, DDX58, and ISGs, such as IFITM3, MX1, and RASD2, which suggests that azithromycin may improve the cell sensitivity to viral infections [39]. Azithromycin could increase rhinovirus-induced IFN and ISG expression as well [40]. It is believed that the IFN-\u03b2 induction by azithromycin is mediated via the MDA5 receptor [92].\nIn addition to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have other specific binding receptors. CD147, also called extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), might be another route for internalization of SARS-CoV-2. It is suggested that azithromycin may interfere with the ligand/receptor interaction of the virus and CD147 [93].\nFurthermore, there are some shreds of evidence that macrolides exert anti-inflammatory effects through inhibiting cytokine release [87]. Lin et al. proved that azithromycin could reduce production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, IL-10, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Therefore, azithromycin was proposed as an immunomodulatory agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases [94]. In another study, azithromycin was shown to alleviate inflammation through suppressing IFN-\u03b3-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and myeloid dendritic cell (mDC), which are the T helper cell 1 (Th1) and Th2 chemokines in monocytes, respectively. Such suppression is caused by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-JNK/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65 signaling pathways [95]. In an experiment on mice, the prophylactic administration of azithromycin reduced airway inflammation, cytokine levels (IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, and IL-6), and mortality rate after respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV) [96].\nThe in vitro antiviral function of azithromycin and its pharmacological effect on COVID-19 in combination with hydroxychloroquine was proved [97]. In vitro experiments in Vero cells showed that these two drugs had a synergistic effect on SARS-CoV-2 [98].\nIn a clinical trial on 80 COVID-19 patients, in cases treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the clinical condition was improved and the disease contagiousness was reduced [42]. The synergistic effect of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was also shown in another COVID-19 trial [41]. Though, Molina et al. claimed that no improvement in patients were observed by using this combination in their study [99].\nUntil September 17, 2020, 112 trials on the efficacy of azithromycin or its combination with other drugs on COVID-19 were registered on clinicaltrials.gov (Table 1), which could hopefully provide insight on using azithromycin in treating COVID-19.\n\n## Aminoglycosides\nAnother class of antibiotics with antiviral activity is aminoglycosides, which are amino-modified sugars. Their antibacterial effect is mediated through binding to the 30S subunit of prokaryotic ribosome and causing mistranslation and premature termination. The antiviral activity of different aminoglycosides was shown against the influenza A virus, Zika virus, and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) [43], [44].\nKim et al. showed that aminoglycosides, especially neomycin B, bound to influenza virus promotor RNA and suppressed its replication [44]. It is proved that topical administration of five aminoglycosides including neomycin, neamine A, kanamycin, sisomicin, and kasugamycin had anti-HSV-2 and anti-influenza A effects in the vaginal and nasal mucosa through upregulation of IFN-I pathway genes and ISGs. The aminoglycoside-induced ISG expression can cause significant protection against both RNA and DNA viruses. Although the effect of neomycin was restricted to the site of administration, a single intranasal dose of this drug was enough to make an expressive enhancement in ISGs. Kasugamycin could significantly reduce the influenza A virus replication in human monocytes and increase the expression of ISGs similar to polyI:C [43].\nStudies proved that TLR3, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u00df (TRIF), and IRF3/7 were the most important signaling molecules that mediated ISG-induction following administration of aminoglycosides (Fig. 1). The phagocytosis of aminoglycoside-containing epithelial cells caused accumulation of RNA-bound aminoglycosides in the endosome, which led to TLR3 activation in the vaginal dendritic cells [43].\nThe immunostimulatory effects of current aminoglycosides were found lower than needed, so their derivatives were investigated. Some aminoglycoside derivatives showed immunostimulatory effects through induction of ISGs, interferon-inducible proteins, and proinflammatory cytokines by activation of phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C [100], [101].\nConsidering all the above, the prophylactic use of aminoglycosides increases host resistance to a wide range of viruses. Though, administration of aminoglycosides, particularly in a prophylactic manner, could not be recommended and requires further investigations because of their side effects [43].\n\n## Nitazoxanide\nNitazoxanide (NTZ) (of the thiazolide family) is a FDA (food and drug administration) approved broad-spectrum non-mutagenic drug, which is highly available and was traditionally used against protozoa and anaerobic intestinal parasites, such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia. Recent studies on protozoa and anaerobic bacteria demonstrated that NTZ successfully inhibited pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), which is an integral enzyme in anaerobic energy metabolism [102]. Apart from its anti-parasitic activities, its potential for elimination of hepaciviruses and astroviruses through IFN signaling and promoting autophagy was proved [47], [48].\nRegarding its effects on the immune system, it reversibly inhibits mTORC1 but not mTORC2 signaling. Given the presence of mTOR catalytic subunit in both mTORC1 and mTORC2, it could possibly block the kinase activity of mTOR indirectly, and might probably affect the upstream mTORC1 regulatory pathway [103]. One study showed that it exerted inhibitory activity against IL-6 production from murine macrophages both in vitro and in vivo\n[104]. NTZ also enhanced the IRF3-induced IFN\u03b2 reporter activity in a dose-dependent way, and in the RIG-I overexpressing cells triggered with 1AB. Furthermore, it enhanced the IFN-Iinduced transcription of the ISGs, IFI27, Mx1, IFITM3, and IFN-\u03b2 LUC activity in MAVS-overexpressing cells even when no other cellular stimulation exists [105].\nMoreover, it inhibited production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [106]. Recent evidence revealed that NTZ potentiated secretion of IFN-Is (alpha and beta) by the host\u2019s fibroblasts in the PBMCs triggered by influenza virus [107].\nNTZ was previously reported to represent an in vitro activity against MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses [106]. Additionally, a regimen of two oral daily doses of NTZ 600\u00a0mg for five days in patients with acute uncomplicated influenza reduced the symptoms with minor adverse effects [108]. To date, about twenty NTZ clinical trials are undergoing worldwide (Table 1), evaluating its probable effectiveness against SARS-CoV2, where it is used in combination with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine (NCT04341493), and some other drugs [46], [49].\n\n## Niclosamide\nIn 1960, scientists at Bayer found the niclosamide efficacy against human tapeworm (cestoda) infection, which was introduced into market for human use as Yomesan\u00ae outside the United States in 1962 [109], [110]. The FDA approved niclosamide to treat tapeworm infection in humans in 1982. It is also mentioned in the World Health Organization list of essential medicines [111]. Millions of people have been treated with niclosamide safely. Despite its vast usage, the mechanism of action has not been clearly established, and was stated to entail uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation [112]. Recently, increasing evidence was found that niclosamide is a multifunctional drug and able to regulate or prevent several biological processes or signaling pathways, proposing its potentiality as a novel therapeutic agent for conditions other than just helminthic diseases. The candidate usages include its firmly and broadly proven anticancer effects [113].\nTo be more detailed, this drug strongly impeded the activation, nuclear translocation, and transactivation of STAT3, while no apparent impact was found on the closely related proteins such as STAT1 and STAT5, Src kinases, and the upstream JAK1, JAK2, or other receptor tyrosine kinases. Additionally, niclosamide suppressed transcription of STAT3 target genes, inhibited cell growth, and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of cancer cells with essentially active STAT3 [114]. An in vitro study of human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS), showed that niclosamide also suppressed production of IFN-c, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17A induced by TNF-\u03b1 in the cultured RA-FLS, which possibly might be moderated by NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, suggesting that phosphorylation of ERK and the JNK anti-inflammatory effect on RA-FLS is affected by niclosamide. Niclosamide strongly inhibited ecretion of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1a, MCP-1) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in cultured DC cells. In this study, niclosamide was found to downregulate generation of IFN-c, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17A in a dose-dependent way by TNF-\u03b1-stimulated RA-FLS [115]. It showed strong STAT3 inhibition through downregulating STAT3 transcriptional activity (Fig. 1) via inhibiting its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in prostate cancer DU145 cells [116]. Another study suggested that suppression of mTORC1 by niclosamide is caused through lysosomal dysfunction. The lysosomal degradative function is blocked by niclosamide probably via changing lysosomal permeability and the pH gradient [114].\nWu et al. discovered that a certain concentration of niclosamide could suppress SARS-CoV replication and totally destroyed the synthesis of viral antigens [117]. The cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV was stopped at a low concentration of niclosamide (1\u00a0\u03bcM). Moreover, it blocked SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC50 value of less than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM [118]. SARS-CoV 3CL protease is identified with a vital role in the processing of replicase polyprotein, and could be a major target for development of anti-SARS agents [119], [120]. In one study on concentrations up to 50\u00a0\u03bcM, no clear inhibitory effect was found against SARS-CoV 3CL protease, therefore, they may be other explanations for its effects [51].\nGassen et al. reported that E3 ligase S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) executed lysine-48-linked poly-ubiquitination of Beclin 1 (BECN1), which caused its proteasomal degradation. Suppression of SKP2 raised the BECN1 level, enhanced autophagy, and effectively decreased MERS-CoV replication. Niclosamide blocked MERS-CoV replication by up to 1000-fold at 48\u00a0h post-infection. At a concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM, niclosamide increased the BECN1 level and autophagy related 14 (ATG14) oligomerization, and raised the number of autolysosomes by more than double and influenced autophagic flux in the cells infected with MERS-CoV [121]. Given the multi-potency of niclosamide, its plausible further mechanisms could not be denied (Table 1).\n\n## Itraconazole\nItraconazole is a member of triazole antifungal agents, which is useful against blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and aspergillosis. The main mechanism of action of itraconazole includes interacting with 14\u03b1-demethylase, a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme, which leads to d",
