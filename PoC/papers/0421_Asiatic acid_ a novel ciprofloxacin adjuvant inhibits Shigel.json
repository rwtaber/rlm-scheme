  "title": "Asiatic acid, a novel ciprofloxacin adjuvant inhibits Shigella flexneri infection.",
  "abstract": "Bacterial infection caused by intracellular pathogens such as Shigella flexneri is a rapidly increasing global health concern that requires urgent and necessary action. The dearth of licensed vaccines against shigellosis and the decline in susceptibility to conventional antibiotics has encouraged the development of new antibiotic principles and drugs. The treatment options are decreasing faster than the discovery rate of new antibacterial agents. Combinatorial approach of antibiotics with non-antibiotic adjuvants is a promising aspect to treat resistant bacterial infections. Asiatic acid, a membrane-disrupting triterpenoid with wide antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties, can potentiate antibiotics, but the exact mechanisms remain broadly unexplored. Therefore, in this study, we screened the interaction of asiatic acid with several antibiotics. The results showed synergistic interactions of asiatic acid with antibiotics against susceptible and multidrug-resistant S. flexneri clinical isolates. Particularly important was the interaction of asiatic acid with the quinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid. A detailed study showed that combined treatment of asiatic acid with ciprofloxacin inhibited S. flexneri biofilm formation and resistance development. An increase in membrane disruption and depolarization upon co-treatment was evident by surface electron and confocal microscopy. In addition, asiatic acid and ciprofloxacin synergism was identified to inhibit efflux activity and intracellular bacterial viability. However, asiatic acid showed no synergistic toxicity with ciprofloxacin towards mammalian cells. The antibacterial activity was further verified in a S. flexneri infected mice model. Therapeutic benefits were evident with reduced bacterial burden, recovery from intestinal tissue damage and increase in mice survivability. The results showed that this combination can target the bacterial membrane, efflux pump proteins and biofilm formation, thereby preventing resistance development. The combination treatment offers a proof of concept in targeting essential bacterial activities and might be developed into a novel and efficient treatment alternative against S. flexneri.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nTreatment of bacterial infections is challenging due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Shigella flexneri, a Gram-negative invasive bacterium associated with bacillary dysentery (bloody diarrhea), was classified as the second major cause of diarrheal death (13.2%) irrespective of age group in 2016, claiming nearly 212,438 lives.1 However, infection is more common among children below 5 y and immunocompromised individuals. In 2021, the mortality rate increased from 6.6% (2000) to 8.1%, just beyond the leading factor rotavirus (24.4%) globally among children.2 Antibiotic therapy is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to tackle shigellosis.3 However, excessive antibiotic usage has led to the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens.4 Currently, meta-analysis data have revealed that nearly 68.7% of strains in Asia to be MDR. Resistance was predominant for WHO recommended 1st choice of drug ciprofloxacin (29.8%), as well as azithromycin (29.2%), and ceftriaxone (23.8%) which are used to treat ciprofloxacin resistant strains.5 Even more concerning reports are emerging from India where resistance to ciprofloxacin is as high as 56.2%6\u201383.36%.7 Despite these high levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin, it still remains the recommended first line of therapy.3 Further, ciprofloxacin resistance is associated with additional resistance to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and macrolides, thus creating extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains.8 Owing to the high prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistance, WHO in 2024 has updated Shigella spp. as a high-priority pathogen.9\nIn this regard, vaccination could be beneficial for reducing antibiotic usage and thereby resistance. However, multiple serotypes (>50) of the pathogen have led to limited progress in vaccine development. No licensed vaccine against Shigella is available in market globally.10 Therefore, the WHO has prioritized the development of unconventional or novel interventions for effective treatment and limiting the spread of this high-priority pathogen.9\nDrug combination is an interesting alternative to address the problem of AMR. The combination of drugs has achieved therapeutic success in treating bacterial infections,11HIV,12cardiovascular diseases,13 and cancer,14 with limited knowledge about their mechanism of action. Natural compounds or phytochemicals are often reported as antibiotic potentiators or adjuvants. Several known herbal compounds with their antimicrobial properties possess the unique ability to enhance the efficacy of conventional antibiotics.15 In addition, the enhancers showing synergism with antibiotics minimizes side effects and limits resistance development with reduced cost. Hence, these antibiotic potentiators have gained the attention of researchers worldwide and are the need of the hour to tackle AMR.\nAsiatic acid (2\u03b1, 23-dihydroxyursolic acid), a pentacyclic triterpenoid (PT) extracted from Centella asiatica, Melastoma malabathricum, Shorea robusta, and other medicinal plants, is well reported to possess anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus,16\nMycobacterium tuberculosis,17\nEscherichia coli,18,19\nClostridium difficile,20\nPseudomonas aeruginosa,18,19 and other bacteria.21 Despite its wide range of antibacterial functions, limited knowledge regarding its mechanism of action is available in the literature. Like other terpenoids, it probably acts by disruption of bacterial membrane,20preventing biofilm formation,18 or bacterial adhesion to host cells.22 Besides, we have recently published that asiatic acid intervened host pathogen interaction by inducing antimicrobial peptide gene expression to prevent the intracellular growth of S. flexneri.23 Apart from its direct antibacterial properties, few studies have shown the synergistic activity of asiatic acid with some antibiotics.24,25 But most of the potentiating activity of asiatic acid with antibiotics is assessed by in vitro drug interactions. In vivo studies are not reported that can guide for trials in humans.\nThis study therefore emphasizes to screen the potential synergistic combination of asiatic acid with conventional antibiotics against S. flexneri and understand the mode of action behind this adjuvant potential of asiatic acid. We further analyzed the mechanism behind Asiatic acid-mediated enhancement of antibiotic efficacy in both cell line and animal model. Overall, this study highlights an effective therapeutic option with a discrete mechanism, therefore holding promising potential for development as an antibiotic adjuvant for combating antibiotic-resistant S. flexneri infection.\n\n## Chemical and reagents\nAsiatic acid (Aa, #546712), chloramphenicol (Chl, #C0378), ampicillin (Amp, #A9518), ciprofloxacin (Cip, #17850), nalidixic acid (Nal, #N8878), tetracycline (Tet, #T7660), streptomycin (S, #S9137), and azithromycin (Az, #PZ0007) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Asiatic acid was suspended in DMSO. Tetracycline, ampicillin and streptomycin were suspended in molecular grade water. Ciprofloxacin was suspended in 0.1\u2009N HCl, nalidixic acid in 0.5\u2009M NaOH, and azithromycin in 95% ethanol. Respective diluents were used as negative control for all experiments.\n\n## Bacterial strains\nS. flexneri standard strain (Sf2457T) and multidrug resistant (MDR) clinical S. flexneri isolates BCH12654, IDH10994, IDH14386, IDH10932, IDH14363, IDH14351, and IDH14377 were used for this study. All strains used belong to the most prevalent serotype 2a. Strain Sf2457T was obtained from Dr. Hemanta Koley, ICMR NIRBI Kolkata. Clinical isolates were obtained from Dr. Asish K Mukhopadhyay's laboratory, ICMR NIRBI, Kolkata. The resistance profiles of the MDR isolates are provided in Supplementary Table S1.\nBacterial strains were routinely maintained in Mueller Hinton agar (#M173) supplemented with 0.025% Congo red (#GRM927) and cultured in Mueller Hinton broth (#M391) at 37\u2009\u00b0C with aeration.\n\n## Cell line and growth conditions\nHT-29, a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (#HTB-38), was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were regularly cultured in complete McCoy's 5A media (#M4892) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (#10082147), 1% nonessential amino acids (#11140050), and 1% penicillin\u2012streptomycin (#15140122) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C.\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility testing\nAntibacterial activities of asiatic acid and antibiotics against S. flexneri strains were examined using micro broth dilution assay in sterile 96-well polystyrene plate (Corning, NY, USA) following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommended guidelines.26 Serial dilutions (two-fold) of antibiotics and asiatic acid (Aa) were carried out in cation-adjusted Mueller\u2012Hinton broth (CA-MHB). The bacterial culture inoculated from the Congo red-positive colony was adjusted to McFarland standards of 0.5 and added to individual wells to achieve an inoculum load of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u2009CFU\u2009mL\u22121.27,28 Wells without drug or bacterial inoculum were used as growth and sterility controls, respectively. The plates were kept at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. After incubation, 10\u2009\u00b5l of resazurin (0.015%) was added to the wells, and the change in dye coloration was monitored. The minimum dose of a compound that failed to change coloration from blue (resazurin) to pink (resorufin product) was taken as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).29\n\n## Drug interaction\nThe interactions between asiatic acid and different antibiotics against the selected bacterial strains were examined using Checkerboard broth dilution method. Briefly, dilutions of asiatic acid and antibiotics were made based on the MIC value of individual compound in CA-MHB, followed by the addition of bacterial inoculum (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u2009CFU\u2009mL\u22121). The MIC of the compounds in combination was determined as described above. The interaction between individual asiatic acid\u2013antibiotic combinations was interpreted based on the FICI score via the following formula:\nFICI\u2009=\u2009(asiatic acid MIC in combination)/(asiatic acid MIC alone)\u2009+\u2009(antibiotic MIC in combination)/(antibiotic MIC alone).\nThe antibiotics used were ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, streptomycin, and azithromycin. The interaction between the combinations is depicted by the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI) score and isobologram as prepared with concentrations of asiatic acid (x-axis) and antibiotic (y-axis) from the Checkerboard assay. Briefly, a FICI value of \u22640.5 and concave curve represent synergistic interactions. The FICI scores of >0.5 and <2 and straight line depict additive interactions, whereas the antagonistic interaction is denoted by FICI\u2009\u2265\u20092 and has convex curve.30\n\n## Time kill assay\nTime- and concentration-dependent antibacterial effects of mono- or combination treatment with asiatic acid and ciprofloxacin against S. flexneri growth was investigated. Fresh CA-MHB tubes were inoculated with 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u2009CFU\u2009mL\u22121 of bacteria.27 Cultures were treated with varying concentrations of asiatic acid (156.25\u22125000\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) or ciprofloxacin (0.0025\u22120.04 or 1\u221216\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121).\nTo examine synergistic growth inhibition, cultures were treated with asiatic acid (156.25\u2009\u00b5g mL\u22121), ciprofloxacin (0.0025 or 2\u2009\u00b5g mL\u22121) alone, or in combination with different bacterial strains. Cultures with the respective vehicle control and no antibacterial agent acted as growth control. All the tubes were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C with aeration. Small volumes of culture media were withdrawn at designated time points from each tube. Ten-fold serial dilution was performed, plated, and kept overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C to determine bacterial viability, which was represented as log10 CFU mL\u22121. A log10 CFU mL\u22121 reduction of \u22652, between co-therapy and the most effective monotherapy agent alone at 24\u2009h, was considered as synergistic growth inhibition.31\n\n## Resistance development assay\nResistance emergence in mono- or combined treatment with sub-MIC concentration of ciprofloxacin and asiatic acid was checked using a previously described protocol.32 Briefly, an exponential-phase culture was diluted in CA-MHB supplemented with ciprofloxacin in the absence or presence of asiatic acid and kept at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. The bacterial MIC against ciprofloxacin was checked as described above. Next, these bacterial cultures were treated with sub-MIC of antimicrobial agents for the upcoming passage and MIC was again evaluated. Sequential passaging was performed continuously for 20 d, and the fold change in MIC of ciprofloxacin was plotted and represented graphically.\n\n## Antibiofilm assay\nBiofilm inhibition activity was assessed in a flat-bottomed 96-well polystyrene plate using established methodology with minor changes.33 Briefly, bacterial culture (108\u2009CFU\u2009mL\u22121) supplemented with 1.2% bile salts (#B8756) in Tryptic Soy Broth (#22092) were treated with asiatic acid (1250\u221239.06\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) and ciprofloxacin (0.02\u22120.000625 or 8\u22120.25\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) alone or in combination at 37\u2009\u00b0C without aeration for 24\u2009h. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (#L3771) was used as a positive control. Bacteria inoculated without bile salt served as a blank. For quantification of biofilm formation, biofilms were washed in PBS and incubated with crystal violet (0.5%) for 10\u2009min. After staining, the biofilms were washed again and air dried. Finally, the stained biofilms were solubilized using ethanol (95%), and the absorbance at 540\u2009nm was measured using microplate ELISA reader (Bio-Tek EL800) and graphically represented as percent biofilm to control.\nFor quantification of biofilm viability, biofilms were washed and suspended in PBS. Ten-fold serial dilutions were plated in MHA and kept overnight to determine the CFU count.\n\n## Biofilm eDNA extraction and visualization\nExtracellular DNA (eDNA) from biofilm matrix was isolated using established methodology with minor modifications.34,35 After removing the planktonic cells, the biofilms were washed with PBS. The biofilm matrix or extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) was then extracted using 1.5\u2009N NaCl and centrifuged at 5000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10\u2009min. The eDNA present in the supernatant (EPS fraction) was measured with NanoDrop (Nabi). Finally, the eDNA was concentrated using ethanol precipitation and visualized on agarose gel.\nFor in situ visualization of the eDNA content of the biofilm matrix, cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS and stained with TOTO-1 (#T3600) dye at 1:1000 dilution and visualized using CLSM (Zeiss LSM 710).36,37\n\n## Exopolysaccharide visualization and quantification\nFor visualization of exopolysaccharide, biofilm grown on coverslips were washed with PBS and stained with 50\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121 of FITC-conjugated Concanavalin A (#C7642). Simultaneously, biofilm were co-stained with Concanavalin A and DAPI (2\u2009\u00b5g mL\u22121) to quantify EPS and bacterial composition. Z-stack images of biofilms were captured using CLSM (Zeiss LSM 710).\nThe polysaccharide content of EPS fraction was determined using phenol sulfuric acid method. After treatment, the biofilm matrix was isolated as described above. Then, an equal volume (20\u2009\u00b5l) of EPS fraction was mixed with phenol (5%). Finally, 100\u2009\u00b5l of sulfuric acid was added, and kept for 10\u2009min at 25\u2009\u00b0C . The absorbance was measured at 490\u2009nm and graphically represented.35\n\n## Bacterial viability assay\nThe viability of treated bacterial samples was analyzed using Live/Dead BacLight viability kit (#L7012) as described previously with slight modifications.38 Bacterial cultures (108\u2009CFU\u2009mL\u22121) were treated with asiatic acid (156.25\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121), ciprofloxacin (0.0025 or 2\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) alone, or in combination at 37\u2009\u00b0C with aeration. After incubation for overnight, the bacterial suspensions were pelleted down at 6000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min, rinsed with 0.85% NaCl and stained with a 1:1 (SYTO9:propidium iodide) ratio of Live/Dead BacLight reagent in 0.85% NaCl. The samples were stained in the dark for 15\u2009min. Fluorescent bacterial samples were imaged using Confocal Microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).\n\n## Microscopic imaging to detect membrane permeability\nThe membrane permeability of the treated bacterial samples was analyzed using FM4-64/DAPI staining (#T13320, #D1306) as described previously with slight modifications.20,38 Bacterial cultures (108\u2009CFU\u2009mL\u22121) were treated with asiatic acid (156.25\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) or ciprofloxacin (0.0025 or 2\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) alone or in combination. After overnight incubation, the bacterial suspensions were pelleted down at 6000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min and washed with PBS. The cells were subsequently incubated with FM4-64 (1\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121) in the dark for 15\u2009 min. Next, the samples were washed and counterstained with DAPI (2\u2009 \u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121) for the same duration in the dark. Fluorescent bacterial samples were imaged using Confocal Microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).\n\n## Surface ultra-structure of bacteria\nMorphological changes in the bacterial samples under treatment were imaged using Field emission scanning electron microscopy. The bacterial samples were treated with Asiatic acid or ciprofloxacin alone or in combination. After treatment, the samples were incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C in fixative buffer containing glutaraldehyde (2.5%) and paraformaldehyde (4%). After fixation, the samples were crosslinked for 1\u2009h in osmium tetroxide (1%). In the following step, the samples were subjected to gradual dehydration using ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%) and dried.20 Finally, the samples were coated with gold and visualized via a Jeol JSM 7500F SEM with an accelerating voltage of 5\u2009kV.\n\n## Determination of nucleic acid leakage\nThe bacterial cultures were treated as discussed above and harvested at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 10\u2009min. Nucleic acid leakage of treated bacterial samples was examined following a previously established protocol.20 The clear supernatant obtained was carefully removed. The absorbance was detected at 260\u2009nm for quantification of the nucleic acid. Total nucleic acid was concentrated using ethanol precipitation method and observed via agarose gel electrophoresis.\nSimultaneously, treated and untreated cells were stained with TOTO-1 (1:1000 dilutions) as described previously to visualize released eDNA.\n\n## Membrane depolarization\nThe membrane potential of bacterial samples was analyzed using DiBAC4(3) (#D8189) staining as reported previously with minor modifications.39 Cultures were grown to an OD600 0.5 and treated with antimicrobial agents at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 4\u2009h with aeration. The cells were then harvested at 6000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009 min, washed in PBS and incubated with DiBAC4(3) (1\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) for 15\u2009 min in the dark. Fluorescent bacterial samples were imaged using Confocal Microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).\n\n## Inner membrane integrity\nExponential bacterial cultures at OD600 0.5 were washed and treated with asiatic acid (156.25\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) or ciprofloxacin (0.0025 or 2\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) alone or in combination for 4\u2009h. The treated samples were washed in PBS, mixed with 10\u2009nM propidium iodide (PI; #P4864) and kept in the dark for 30\u2009min. The fluorescence intensity of PI was determined using spectrofluorometer (BMG Labtech) at 535\u2009nm (excitation) and 615\u2009nm (emission) wavelengths.40\n\n## Immunoblotting\nAsiatic acid- and ciprofloxacin-treated and co-treated bacterial cultures were washed in chilled PBS and ruptured using bacterial lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor and PMSF. The total bacterial protein fraction was harvested by centrifugation at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min at 7000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g. In the next step, the protein level was estimated by BCA assay kit (#23225), processed and run on 10% SDS\u2012PAGE gel. After transferring and blocking (5% nonfat milk, 1\u2009h), the membranes were incubated overnight with an anti-GAPDH antibody (#D16H11) (1:3000), anti-AcrA antibody (#BB-SAP50) (1:3000), and anti-AcrB antibody (#BB-SAP50) (1:3000) at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The following day, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody (1:10,000) and washed with TBST. The bands were finally imaged using HRP substrate (Millipore) in a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad, USA). The relative fold change in protein expression was determined after normalization against GAPDH41,42 using Image Lab software (version 5.2.1).\n\n## Quantitative PCR\nBacterial subcultures grown to OD600 of 0.5 were harvested for RNA isolation using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). DNA contamination was removed using DNA-free kit (Ambion). cDNA was synthesized using cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol. qRT\u2012PCR was run on ABI 7500 Fast real-time PCR system using SYBR Green master mix kit (#A25742). The expression levels were normalized using 16\u2009s rRNA (internal control), and the fold change was calculated using 2\u2212\u0394\u0394C method. The primer sequences used are listed in Supplementary Table S4.\n\n## Molecular docking\nThe 3D structures of AcrA and AcrB of Gram-negative bacteria were obtained from PDB database, and the structures of asiatic acid, ciprofloxacin, and PA\u03b2N (MC-207110) were obtained from the PubChem database. Molecular docking was executed using Autodock vina software,43 and the probable docking position of AcrA and AcrB was taken from the references.44\u201346 After collecting the probable positions, we first docked the antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) at the substrate binding site of AcrA and AcrB. The docked complex of AcrA and AcrB with ciprofloxacin was then used to dock PA\u03b2N and asiatic acid. Finally, Discovery Studio visualizer47 was used to collect the bonding information between AcrA and AcrB with above mentioned compounds in their best docked position.\n\n## EtBr efflux kinetics\nEthidium bromide efflux assays were performed using previously established protocol.48 Briefly, S. flexneri cultures (Sf2457T/BCH12654) were grown to the exponential phase (O.D600\u2009 of 0.6). The cultures were then loaded with 20\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121 of EtBr and incubated for 1\u2009h at RT. The bacterial cultures were then diluted in PBS to attain an OD600 of 0.2. The cells were then rinsed and resuspended in PBS containing 0.4% glucose and treated with asiatic acid (625\u221278.125\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121). PA\u03b2N (#P4157) was used as a positive control. Fluorescence was detected using fluorescence spectrophotometer (BMG Labtech) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 520 and 590\u2009nm, respectively, for 1\u2009h at 5\u2009min intervals.\n\n## Cytotoxicity assay\nTo determine the toxicity of asiatic acid and antibiotic treatment in HT29 cells, an MTT (#CT02) dye assay was performed.49 Shortly, cells (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were cultured in plate (96 well) and kept for 24\u2009h in 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The following day, the cells were subjected to different doses of asiatic acid, antibiotics alone, or in combination, keeping respective vehicle as a control for 24\u2009h. After treatment, MTT solution (20\u2009\u00b5l of 5\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121) was added to the wells, and the mixture was further kept for 4\u2009h. The formazan crystals that precipitated were dissolved using DMSO. The color intensity was measured using microplate ELISA reader (Bio-Tek EL800) at 570\u2009nm and graphically represented as the percent viability normalized to the control.\n\n## Infection assay\nThe invasion assay was performed using protocol described earlier.50 In brief, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 HT29 cells were cultured in plates (6 wells) and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C to reach confluency in monolayer. Subsequently, an overnight bacterial culture from a single colony was subcultured to an OD600 0.5. Thereafter, the bacterial cultures were harvested at 6000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u2009min, washed in sterile PBS and dissolved in culture media lacking antibiotics. Infection was performed at a 100:1 multiplicity of infection (MOI). The plates were centrifuged at 700\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 15\u2009min and kept for 2\u2009h to facilitate bacterial invasion. Following infection, residual bacteria were removed by washing with PBS and incubated with gentamicin solution (50\u2009\u00b5g mL\u22121) in culture media for 2\u2009h. Next, the infected cells were again washed, and based on the bacterial strain subjected to different doses of asiatic acid, antibiotics treatment alone, or in combination for 24\u2009h in culture media containing 10\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121 of gentamicin. Based on asiatic acid and/or antibiotic treatment, respective vehicle or vehicle combination was used as a negative control. Post-treatment, the cells were thoroughly washed in PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Ten-fold dilutions of the lysed suspensions were spread onto MHA and kept overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C to determine the % intracellular viability from the CFU count.\n\n## Animals\nAdult BALB/c mice approximately 20\u201324\u2009g in weight were used for the animal experiments. The mice were collected from ICMR-NIRBI, Kolkata, Animal Resources Department. The animals were kept under recommended laboratory conditions with 24\u2009\u00b0C temperature and 75% humidity condition in a separate animal house. The animals were given a quality pellet diet and sufficient water.\n\nAdult BALB/c mice were taken as a model for in vivo experiments. Food was withdrawn from all the cages 24\u2009h prior to infection. The fasted mice were unbiasedly divided into groups (n\u2009=\u20096/group) and intraperitoneally infected with 108 CFU of S. flexneri (Sf2457T/BCH12654).51 4\u2009h post infection, the mice were orally administered with vehicle, asiatic acid (25\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121),52,53 ciprofloxacin (1 or 20\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121)54,55 alone, or in combination. The control group, without infection, was also orally subjected to vehicle in the same manner.\nSimilarly, infected mice were treated with nalidixic acid (5 or 10\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) alone,56 in combination with asiatic acid (25\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121).\n\n## Survival Kinetics\nThe mortality of mice subjected to intraperitoneal infection with S. flexneri (Sf2457T/BCH12654), followed by treatment with ciprofloxacin (1 or 20\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121) in the presence or absence of asiatic acid (25\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121), was monitored over the next 3 d. The survival kinetics of the mice were plotted using Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis curve.\n\nThe mice were subjected to infection and treatment, similar to the in vivo survival kinetics study. Sixteen hours post-infection, blood samples were collected from the mice. The animals were then euthanized, and the colon, spleen, and liver were collected aseptically. The colonic tissues were transversely cut open and washed to remove the luminal contents. Next, all the tissue samples were treated with gentamicin solution (100\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121) for 1\u2009h. After gentamicin treatment, the tissues were washed in PBS, homogenized, ten-fold serially diluted in sterile PBS and spread plated on MHA supplemented with Congo red dye to determine the bacterial load.\n\n## Immunohistochemistry\nFormalin-fixed colonic tissue sections were deparaffinized, serially rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was carried out in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). The tissues were permeabilized (0.1% Triton X, 10\u2009min), washed, and blocked in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin and 5% FBS in PBS) for 1\u2009h. Next, the tissues were incubated with an anti-Shigella antibody (#ab65282) at a 1:100 dilution for overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The tissues were further washed with PBST (1\u00d7 PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (#T6778) at a 1:500 dilution for 2\u2009h. After being washed with PBST, the tissues were stained with DAPI and mounted using ProLong Diamond Antifade media and visualized using Axio Observer (Zeiss).\n\n## Histopathological study\nTreated mice tissues were fixed with buffered formalin (10%), followed by gradual dehydration with ethanol (50%\u2013100%) and xylene. The tissues were then carefully embedded in paraffin solution (56\u2009\u00b0C\u201358\u2009\u00b0C) at 58\u2009\u00b1\u20091\u2009\u00b0C and incubated for 4\u2009h. Following deparaffinization with xylene, the tissues were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and mounted on a clean cover slip using DPX. Images were captured using a bright field microscope (Motic, Germany) to visualize histological variations among the control, infected and treatment groups. Colonic sections were analyzed for epithelial fenestration using ProgRes CapturePro software, and % Fenestration [(length of the colonic epithelium section with signs of fenestration/total length of the colonic epithelium section)*100] was calculated.57\n\n## Statistical test\nThe results obtained in this study were statistically compared using GraphPad Prism 8 software (San Diego, USA). The results are represented as mean\u2009\u00b1SEM of three individual biological replicates, and statistical comparisons among groups were determined using the most significant statistical test (t-test, one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA). The results were regarded as statistically significant at p\u2009<\u20090.05. Differences among groups are represented in the figures by distinct superscript letters.\n\n## Combination of asiatic acid with common antibiotics exhibited synergism\nPreviously, we have shown that asiatic acid, a triterpenoid, ameliorates S. flexneri intracellular growth by activating antimicrobial peptide gene (AMP) expression in intestinal cells.23 Herein, we investigated the interaction of asiatic acid with different antibiotics. The antibiotic panel included a cell wall synthesis inhibitor (ampicillin), protein synthesis inhibitors (streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and azithromycin) and DNA synthesis inhibitors (nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin). An antimicrobial susceptibility assay against the standard S. flexneri ATCC strain was performed using asiatic acid\u2013antibiotic combination. Interestingly, the screening results showed that asiatic acid has a synergistic effect and significantly reduces the susceptible dose of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid, with FICI score of 0.374, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.375, respectively (Supplementary Table. S2). However, the remaining antibiotics showed additive or antagonistic interaction with asiatic acid. Next, to test the spectrum of asiatic acid as an adjuvant against S. flexneri infection, we checked its interaction against a panel of MDR clinical isolates. In line, asiatic acid restored the susceptibility of the majority of the MDR isolates to antibiotics, similar to the standard strain. Overall, potentiating effect was observed for ampicillin (5 strains), chloramphenicol (4 strains), ciprofloxacin (6 strains), and nalidixic acid (5 strains), with FICI value ranging from 0.25 to 0.5, 0.28 to 0.5, 0.25 to 0.5, and 0.25 to 0.5, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). These findings suggest that asiatic acid is a potential broad-spectrum antibiotic adjuvant for combating MDR S. flexneri infection.\nDespite the loss of sensitivity towards ciprofloxacin, it still remains WHO recommended first choice of antibiotic for shigellosis.3 Due to the clinical and therapeutic importance of ciprofloxacin as an anti-shigella drug and the results showing that the Asiatic acid\u2012ciprofloxacin combination is the most effective synergistic pair, we further focused our study on this combination. The interaction between ciprofloxacin and asiatic acid on the growth of all the bacterial strains studied here was further confirmed by the isobologram method. An isobolograms with a concave curve demonstrated synergistic growth inhibition against standard and most of the clinical isolates (Figure 1). These results validate the synergism between asiatic acid and ciprofloxacin against S. flexneri infection.\n\n## Asiatic acid prevents ciprofloxacin driven resistance development\nTreatment with asiatic acid and ciprofloxacin monotherapy showed dose dependent S. flexneri (Sf2457T and BCH12654) growth inhibition (Supplementary Figure S1). To further investigate the synergistic interaction between ciprofloxacin and asiatic acid, time kill assay was performed. Cotherapy doses showing highest synergistic interaction (lowest FICI score) against Sf2457T [(0.25); 156.25Aa\u2009+\u20090.0025Cip\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121] and BCH12564 [(0.375); (156.25Aa\u2009+\u20092Cip\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121)] (Figure 1) were selected to investigate the underlying mechanism of synergism against planktonic growth.
