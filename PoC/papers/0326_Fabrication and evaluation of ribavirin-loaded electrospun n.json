  "title": "Fabrication and evaluation of ribavirin-loaded electrospun nanofibers as an antimicrobial wound dressing.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skin is regarded as an essential first line of defense against harmful pathogens and it hosts an ecosystem of microorganisms that create a widely diverse skin microbiome. In chronic wounds, alterations in the host-microbe interactions occur forming polymicrobial biofilms that hinder the process of wound healing. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, possesses antimicrobial activity, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, which are known as the main opportunistic pathogens in chronic wounds. RATIONALE: In this study, electrospun nanofiber systems loaded with ribavirin were developed as a potential wound dressing for topical application in chronic wounds. Ribavirin was chosen in this study owing to the emerging cases of antimicrobial (antibiotics and antifungal) resistance and the low attempts to discover new antimicrobial agents, which encouraged the repurposing use of current medication as an alternative solution in case of resistance to the available agents. Additionally, the unique mechanism of action of ribavirin, i.e., perturbing the bacterial virulence system without killing or stopping their growth and rendering the pathogens disarmed, might be a promising choice to prevent drug resistance. Cyclodextrin (CD) was utilized to formulate ribavirin as an electrospun nanofibers delivery system to enhance the absorption and accelerate the release of ribavirin for topical use. RESULTS: The results demonstrated a successful ribavirin nanofibers fabrication that lacked beads and pores on the nanofibrous surfaces. Ribavirin underwent a physical transformation from crystalline to amorphous form, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. This change occurred due to the molecular dispersion after the electrospinning process. Additionally, the CD enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of ribavirin in the nanofibers as observed from the drug-loading results. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and CD increased ribavirin released into the solution and the disintegration of fibrous mats which shrank and eventually dissolved into a gel-like substance as the ribavirin-loaded fibers began to break down from their border toward the midpoint. Cytotoxicity of ribavirin and CD was evaluated against human dermal fibroblasts (HFF-1) and the results showed a relatively safe profile of ribavirin upon 24-hour cell exposure, while CD was safe within 24- and 48-hour. CONCLUSION: This study provides valuable insights into the potential application of our nanofibrous system for treating chronic wounds; however, further antimicrobial and in-vivo studies are required to confirm its safety and effectiveness.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nSkin is the body's largest multifunctional organ acting as its primary defense mechanism against physical, chemical, and immunological threats from the external environment. It also hosts an ecosystem of a widely diverse population of microbes. Bacteria, viruses and microeukaryotes such as fungi form complex communities of microorganisms inhabiting various parts of the skin. The skin itself provides a niche of microbial populations that are exposed to variability of ecological factors such as pH, temperature, and humidity, and are associated with microbial diversity (Grice et al., 2009). The relationships between microbes within a host can be categorized into three groups based on their effects on the species involved. These relationships may have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on the host or the microbes. Under normal physiological conditions, the majority of these microbes are commensals (i.e.,\u00a0nonpathogenic)\u00a0and are maintained in homeostasis.\u00a0However, microbial imbalance (known as microbial dysbiosis), host immune system status or genetic alterations may lead to the transition of skin microbiota from being commensal to becoming pathogenic (Findley and Grice, 2014). In other words, alterations in the host-microbe interactions can be linked to disease state.\nIt has been reported that there are at least nineteen phyla on human skin, with four exhibiting the highest abundance of bacterial species: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes (Schommer and Gallo, 2013, Callewaert et al., 2020). The bacterial distribution and diversity of such species depend on the physiological characteristics of the skin niches; for instance, sebaceous sites are dominated by Propionibacterium (Actinobacteria), while Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) and Corynebacterium (Actinobacteria) thrive in humid environments (Grice et al., 2009, Schommer and Gallo, 2013, Byrd et al., 2018). Fungal communities, unlike bacteria, have a similar composition across the core body predominately by the genus\u00a0Malassezia (Byrd et al., 2018). Reports of viruses such as human papillomavirus, human polyomaviruses, circoviruses, and bacteriophages indicated the presence of viral flora in healthy and diseased skin (Foulongne et al., 2012, Findley and Grice, 2014).\nThe process of wound healing is complex and distinctive as it is regulated by numerous growth factors, chemokines, and cytokines and involves the interaction of cells resulting in cell migration and wound closure (Tottoli et al., 2020). Whenever this process is perturbed, chronic wounds occur with a lack of migration and an increased rate of keratinocyte proliferation leading to extracellular matrix remodeling and, in most cases, persistent inflammation (Sachdeva et al., 2022). Some of the most common forms of chronic wounds include diabetic ulcers, venous ulcers, and pressure ulcers (Sen, 2021, Sachdeva et al., 2022). In a typical wound-healing process, commensal microorganisms interact with the skin cells to initiate an intrinsic immune reaction (Harrison et al., 2019, Sachdeva et al., 2022). However, chronic wounds harbor activities of polymicrobial biofilms hindering the process of wound healing. Wolcott\u00a0et al\u00a0reported a biofilm formation that was associated with 60\u00a0% of chronic wound patients, predominantly caused by\u00a0Pseudomonas aeruginosa\u00a0(P. aeruginosa) (Wolcott et al., 2016). Persistent biofilms contribute to a higher prevalence of opportunistic infections and antimicrobial resistance which can further hinder effective treatments (Sachdeva et al., 2022). It has been reported that fungi such as\u00a0Candida spp.\u00a0play an important role as an opportunistic pathogen in chronic wounds. Moreover, fungi associated with non-healing wounds contribute to antimicrobial resistance by enabling commensal bacteria to evade the host's immune response turning wounds into reservoirs for multi-resistant species.\nNumerous studies suggested novel wound treatments to offer long-term relief and lower healthcare expenses, intending to achieve more effective wound healing. Skin wound therapies can be categorized into conventional or regenerative therapies. In an attempt to overcome functional alterations often associated with conventional therapy, regenerative wound therapy became a rapidly growing field in biomedical research, intending to rejuvenate skin to its original state by repairing damaged cells and tissues without leaving scars.\nThe emergence of antimicrobial resistance of a wide range of bacterial species encouraged researchers to repurpose the use of currently used and effective agents. One of the medications explored for their antimicrobial activity is ribavirin. It has been reported that ribavirin successfully protected Caenorhabditis elegans\u00a0and mice from\u00a0P. aeruginosa\u00a0infection (Yuan et al., 2022). Ribavirin, an\u00a0early-stage antiviral drug, has unique antimicrobial activities, especially against\u00a0P. aeruginosa\u00a0and\u00a0Candida albicans\u00a0(C. albicans). The mechanism by which ribavirin acts as an antimicrobial drug varies according to the type of its targeted microbe. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which are associated with the risk of antibiotic resistance, they act by perturbing the bacterial virulence system without killing or stopping their growth, rendering the pathogens disarmed, which might be a promising mechanism to prevent drug resistance (Mandal et al., 2016, Yuan et al., 2022). Hence, this antiviral drug is a promising agent that can be fabricated and repurposed as anti-pseudomonal drugs.\nMethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (CD), in itself, does not have any known antimicrobial activity, however, it was reported that it can delay bacterial growth when combined with an antimicrobial drug (Jaiswal et al., 2010, Boczar and Michalska, 2022). The\u00a0CD might also improve the drug delivery and the stability of nanofiber formulation while maintaining the antimicrobial properties of ribavirin. The CD and its derivatives have robust properties due to the ability to complex with various compounds since the internal hydrophobicity and external hydrophilicity characteristics. Moreover, the biocompatibility of CD polymers increases their use in the field of drug delivery to carry different laded materials to targeted sites and improve the efficacy of encapsulated drugs (Pinho et al., 2014). It has been demonstrated that CD polymer has adhesive properties that can be exploited in wound-dressing manufacturing (Wang et al., 2023a). The formulation of bilirubin/CD adhesive hydrogel has been reported to promote wound healing in diabetic and non-diabetic in vivo, indicating the ability to be used as a wound dressing agent (Yao et al., 2021).\nPolyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) has unique physicochemical properties making it one of the most used polymers in biomedical applications. The pharmaceutical industry is the most recognized field that benefited from the use of PVP polymer since it is chemically stable, nontoxic, biodegradable, biocompatible, temperature-resistant, pH-stable, nonionic, soluble in water and several organic solvents and has an affinity to complex with hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds (Teodorescu and Bercea, 2015). Dynamic interaction between PVP copolymer hydrogels and skin cells was investigated and results indicated the biocompatibility of this polymer and its ability to form macromolecular network with living cells and ability to support the growth of skin cells (Smith et al., 2006). Moreover, PVP polymer has an important function in bonding strength and increasing product viscosity. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that PVP can be used in different biomedical adhesive applications such as the fabrication of nanofibers for drug delivery, nanofibers for wound healing, and other different applications in the biomedical field (Chen et al., 2012).\nSeveral studies showed the effectiveness of PVP for in vivo applications. For example, it was reported that PVP was used with celecoxib to formulate solid dispersion nanoparticles that have a size lower than 300\u00a0nm and the formulation was used in vitro and in vivo (Ha et al., 2014). Their results demonstrate that their formulation can enhance the bioavailability of celecoxib which is hydrophobic. Another study evaluates PVP to form a film with an anti-inflammatory Trans-resveratrol drug and the result shows that this formulation can decrease the inflammation in vivo by approximately 66\u00a0% (Riccio et al., 2022). In addition, several other studies demonstrated a lack of toxicity of PVP owing to its biologically inertness (Wessel et al., 1971, Nair, 1998). Furthermore, PVP is an FDA-approved polymer and several marketed products use PVP in their formulation such as Inadine\u00ae which is presented as PVP-Iodine that is used as an antiseptic for wound healing (Kurakula and Rao, 2020).\nThe electrospinning technique involves applying a high electric potential with two electrodes of opposite polarity to completely evaporate a polymeric solution and form a fibrous structure. The concept behind electrospinning involves the application of a high voltage to a viscous polymer droplet, overcoming its surface tension, converting the droplet to a cone-like shape, and finally, allowing the solvent to evaporate and fibers to form. Electrospinning is a powerful tool that enables the formation of fibers with various diameters. Since fabricating flexible and adaptable formulations are simple, electrospun fibers were utilized in many applications which include the delivery of drugs and the healing of tissue wounds. These fibers are also desirable substrates for drug administration due to their capacity to encapsulate a variety of active substances, including medicines, peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, and cells (Aburayan et al., 2020, Alshaya et al., 2022).\nOne of the most important parameters that play a key role in the preparation and loading of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) into electrospun nanofibers is the optimal controlling of preparation conditions such as using a suitable temperature that is safe for the integrity of loaded drug. The high temperature could affect the chemical integrity and properties of the loaded drug. Different techniques can be taken into consideration to offer sustainable and efficient methods for improving the stability of loaded API such as the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) approach which is conducted normally in low temperatures (Ponphaiboon et al., 2023). This method refers to ultrasonic waves or energy that exceeds the human hearing threshold of 20\u00a0kHz. The main advantage of applying ultrasonic energy is the protection of heat-sensitive compounds by eliminating the need for high temperatures (Picot-Allain et al., 2021). Therefore, applying this approach can protect the loaded drug from the effect of elevated temperature during the electrospinning process that is created from the use of high voltage and maintain its chemical integrity and properties during the process of electrospinning.\nConsequently, in this study, ribavirin-loaded electrospun fiber systems were fabricated using CD and PVP to enhance its release, bioavailability and absorption, and these fibers were evaluated for their potential topical use for chronic wounds applications.\n\n## Materials\nPolyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) that has a molecular weight of 1,300\u00a0kDa, CD with a molecular weight of 1.303\u00a0kDa, ethyl alcohol (\u226599.5\u00a0%) and all buffer salts used, i.e., potassium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, sodium chloride and potassium chloride, were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Triethanolamine was obtained from Loba Chemie (Mumbai, India) and the ribavirin (Mw\u00a0=\u00a0244.20) was purchased from Biosynthesis Carbosynth (Compton, UK). P. aeruginosa \u2013 ATCC 27853, ATCC 1744, and PAO1, C. albicans \u2013 ATCC 66027, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)ATCC 29,213 and MRSA\u2014ATCC 43300, Escherichia coli (E. coli) ATCC 25922, and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) ATCC 747 reference microbes were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA). Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa (7067), E. coli (1060) and A. baumannii (3034) were also used in this study. Mueller\u2013Hinton agar (MHA) and Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) were purchased from Scharlau (Barcelona, Spain) and afterwards prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Water used in experimental preparations was distilled via the Milli-Q\u00ae IQ 7005 Purification System (Millipore SAS Molsheim, France).\n\n## Preparation of the ribavirin-loaded fibers\nAll fibrous systems were fabricated according to the modified methods of these previous studies Aburayan et al., 2020, Alamer et al., 2023, Alshaya et al., 2022. A solution of PVP and ethanol (8\u00a0% w/v) was stirred for one hour at an ambient temperature on a magnetic stirrer. After the solution became homogeneous, 20\u00a0% w/v CD was mixed with the mixture for another hour. After the complete dissolution of both materials, 2\u00a0% w/v of ribavirin was mixed with the solution and it was left under stirring for\u00a0an hour. Spraybase\u00ae electrospinning instrument (Dublin, Ireland) was used for the fabrication of the fibers. The solution was added into a syringe (5\u00a0mL) with a 0.9\u00a0mm needle diameter. The syringe stream was controlled by a pump, and the flow rate, collector distance and voltage were adjusted at 0.8\u00a0mL/hour, 20\u00a0cm and 7\u20139\u00a0kV, respectively. The metallic collector was wrapped with aluminum foil for easy collection of the fibers. The electrospinning was performed at ambient temperature and approximate humidity of 30 to 40\u00a0%. A similar electrospinning set-up was used to prepare blank fibers (i.e., ribavirin-free fibers), PVP-only fibers, and ribavirin-loaded PVP-only fibers. All fibrous systems were peeled off easily from the aluminum foil using a surgical tweezer and kept in an air-tight chamber (dry-keeper) for storage.\n\n## Morphology assessment of ribavirin-loaded fibers using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nSEM (JSM-IT500HR SEM, JEOL Inc., Peabody, USA) was used to analyze the morphology of the fibers. A piece of the foil with collected fibers was put on a metal stub and the samples were analyzed without the need to coat the sample with a conductive material similar to the previous studies of Aburayan et al., (2020) and Alshaya et al., (2022). The fiber's diameter was evaluated by the microscope\u2019s software (SEM Operation: 3.010, version 1.010, JEOL TECHNICS Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) by measuring the diameter of a minimum of 30 fibers.\n\n## Characterization of the solid-state using X-ray diffraction (XRD)\nRigaku miniflex 300/600 (Tokyo, Japan), with a Cu K\u03b1 radiation point (\u03bb) of 1.5148 227\u00a0\u00c5 was used to characterize the solid state of ribavirin after being electrospun according to a previous study by Alshaya et al., (2022). The specimen was directly positioned on a glass mount and inspected at 40\u00a0kV, 15\u00a0mA and a scan speed of 5\u00b0/min (2\u03b8: 2\u201360\u00b0).\n\n## Characterization of the solid-state using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)\nThermo smart ATR IS20 Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to conduct FTIR analysis. Ribavirin, CD, PVP, three different physical mixtures (PM), blank and ribavirin-loaded nanofiber systems were placed on the sampling spot one sample at a time in small quantities (around 5\u00a0mg). Samples were analyzed at a specific wavenumber range of 4000 to 400\u00a0cm\u22121 based on a modified method of Alkahtani et al., (2021). The spectral resolution was configured at 4\u00a0cm\u22121, and 32 scans were conducted for each sample.\n\n## Quantification of ribavirin using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\nHPLC was used to identify and quantify ribavirin. A serial dilution of six ribavirin concentrations (200\u20136.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) was prepared by dissolving ribavirin in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 6.8). An HPLC set-up of Waters e2695 was utilized that consists of a Waters 600 binary pump, Waters\u00ae 717 plus autosampler, and Waters 2489 UV/detector (Waters Technologies Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), which is similar to the HPLC set-up of the previous study of Alamer et al., (2023). Ribavirin was identified according to a modified method of Inoue et al., 2004, D'Avolio et al., 2006, and Haggag et al., 2014 using a C18 column (4.6\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0250\u00a0mm, 5\u00a0\u03bcm), while the mobile phase was 1\u00a0% v/v triethanolamine (pH 3.9). An isocratic elution with a flow rate of 1\u00a0mL/min was used. The column temperature, the volume of injection and the detection wavelength were adjusted at ambient temperature, 10\u00a0\u03bcL and 254\u00a0nm, respectively. Ribavirin was identified at a retention time (Rt) of 4.5\u00a0min, which is very close to the reported ribavirin Rt of the previous studies (i.e. Rt 4.1\u20134.7\u00a0min) (Inoue et al., 2004, D'Avolio et al., 2006, Haggag et al., 2014).\n\n## Quantification of ribavirin-loaded fibers drug loading (DL) and encapsulation efficiency (EE%)\nThe DL and EE% of the ribavirin-loaded PVP/CD fibers and ribavirin-loaded PVP-only fibers were quantified by dissolving three pieces of the fiber at a weight of 4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mg in PBS (pH 6.8), for four hours at room temperature, according to a slightly modified method of Alamer et al., (2023). The samples were measured after the complete dissolving of the ribavirin-loaded fibers and subjected to the previously HPLC-developed method. The EE% and DL were analyzed by the subsequent formulas:(1)EE%=ActualdrugamountTheoreticaldrugamount\u00d7100(2)DL=EntrappeddrugamountFibersWeight\n\n## Determination of ribavirin-loaded fibers disintegration rate\nThe disintegration of blank PVP/CD fibers, PVP-only fibers, ribavirin-loaded PVP/CD fibers, and ribavirin-loaded PVP-only fibers was evaluated using the petri dish method, according to the previous studies of Alamer et al., 2023, Alshaya et al., 2022 and Alkahtani et al., 2021. Briefly, certain weights of each nanofibrous system were positioned inside Petri dishes half-filled with pre-warmed PBS (37\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 6.8), mimicking the pH of an open wound that ranges from 6.5 to 8.5 (Louisa et al., 2017). The dishes were kept in a trembling incubator (Excella E24 Incubator Shaker Series, New Brunswick Scientific Co., Enfield, CT, USA) until a complete detachment of the fiber mats occurred, which was recorded in seconds.\n\n## Quantification of ribavirin-loaded fibers release rate\nThe drug release rate of ribavirin-loaded PVP/CD fibers and ribavirin-loaded PVP fibers were assessed after weighing a certain amount of both fibrous systems and dissolving them into 20\u00a0mL PBS (pH 6.8) using custom-made sinkers to keep the fibers at the bottom of the vials, by a modified method of the release studies of Alamer et al., 2023, Alshaya et al., 2022 and Alkahtani et al., 2021. The vials were kept inside a trembling incubator (Excella E24 Incubator Shaker Series, New Brunswick Scientific Co., Enfield, CT, USA) at a shaking rate of 100 RPM and a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. One mL of samples was obtained from each vial after 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300\u00a0min. To maintain the sink conditions, an equivalent volume of fresh PBS was replaced. The determination of the released ribavirin amount was obtained by the previously HPLC-developed method. The cumulative release % was quantified according to the following equation:(3)CumulativeRelease%=CumulativedrugamountTheoreticaldrugamount\u00d7100\n\n## Determination of ribavirin and CD \nThe assessment of in-vitro cellular viability of ribavirin, CD and their combination was performed following 24 and 48-hour cellular exposure to the human fibroblast HFF-1 cells (ATCC- SCRC-1401). The evaluation of the metabolic activity of ribavirin was conducted using the modified method of Ahmed et al., (2023), using the colorimetric MTS assay (cell Titer 96\u00ae Aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay, Promega, Southampton, UK). HFF-1 cells were sub-cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) containing the following: streptomycin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), FBS (10\u00a0% (v/v)), and penicillin (100 U/mL), which were brought from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Following 90\u2013100\u00a0% cell confluency, trypsin solution was applied and incubated for several minutes, and then HFF-1 cells were counted after harvested using the trypan blue exclusion test. The collected cells were then seeded into 96-well plates with a seeding density of 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104 cells/well. The seeded cells were then incubated in a cell culture incubator overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5\u00a0% CO2. 100\u00a0\u00b5L of diluted concentration of the ribavirin (5,000 to 156.25\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), CD (20,000 to 156.25\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and their combination in a ratio of 20:1CD: ribavirin (20,000/1,000 to 156.25/7.81\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) were then added to the HFF-1 cells for 24 and 48-hour. Negative and positive controls of cells incubated with DMEM only and Triton X-100 (0.2\u00a0%) treated cells, respectively were used as experimental controls. After the designated incubation times (i.e., 24 and 48\u00a0h. Thereafter, removal of the medium from each well was performed and then wells were washed gently with PBS followed by adding fresh DMEM (100\u00a0\u03bcL) in each well. 20\u00a0\u03bcL of the MTS reagent was then added to each well and cells were incubated in the CO2 incubator for a further 3\u00a0h. The absorbance of formazan color produced by living cells was measured at 492\u00a0nm using the Cytation 3 absorbance microplate reader (BIOTEK Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA. The relative percentage of living cells was measured according to the following equation of Jarallah et al., (2023):(4)Cell Viability % = (S-T)/ (H-T)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100where S, T and H are the absorbances of cells treated with ribavirin, Triton X-100 and media only, respectively.\n\n## Determination of ribavirin and CD minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)\nThe broth microdilution method was applied as outlined by CLSI guidelines to test ribavirin and CD alone and in combination but with few modifications (Wayne, 2015). A serially diluted (2-fold dilutions) ranging concentrations of ribavirin (2,500\u201319.53\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), CD (25,000\u2013195.31\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and 1:10 combination (2,500/25,000\u201319.53/195.31\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) was tested against P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853, ATCC 1744, PAO1, and the clinical isolate 7067), S. aureus (ATCC 29213), MRSA (ATCC 43300), E. coli (ATCC 25922, and the clinical isolate 1060), A. baumannii (ATCC 747 and the clinical isolate 7067, and the clinical isolate 3034), and C. albicans (ATCC 66027). Then, 100\u00a0\u03bcL of the microbial inoculums (0.5 McFarland standard) was added to each well with a final cell density of 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 CFU/mL. Wells with microbe without treatment were considered as a positive control and wells with media (MHB) only were considered as a negative control. The 96-well microtiter plates of the bacterial strains were incubated overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, while the C. albicans plates were incubated at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and with a continuous shaking speed of 160 RPM. The lowest concentration with no visible growth was considered as the MIC. Microbial growth inhibition was also assessed by measuring UV absorbance at 600\u00a0nm with a PowerWave XS2 plate reader (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France).\n\n## Determination of the antimicrobial activity of ribavirin-loaded fibers\nThe antimicrobial activity of the ribavirin-loaded PVP/CD fibers and ribavirin-loaded PVP fibers was evaluated, against the same bacterial and C. albicans strains used in the MIC test, using the agar-diffusion method per the modified protocol of He et al., (2020). The plates were inoculated with 100\u00a0\u03bcL of 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108 (CFU)/mL (0.5 McFarland standard) bacteria and fungus inoculums and spread onto the surface of MHA plates. Then, certain amounts of the ribavirin-loaded fibers, which contained 625\u00a0\u03bcg of the drug, and their corresponding weights for the blank fiber systems were positioned on the surface of the MHA plates. As a test control, 20\u00a0\u03bcL of ribavirin diluted in MHB was added on filter discs, which is equivalent to a concentration of the ribavirin-loaded fibers. Following incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight for the bacterial strains and at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for C. albicans, the diameters of the clear zones of microbial inhibitions were measured in millimeters (mm).\n\n## Statistical analysis\nThe results of fibers\u2019 diameter, XRD, FTIR, HPLC calibration curve and linearity, and ribavirin release rate were analyzed and plotted by OriginPro 2021 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). All findings in the DL, EE%, drug release, fibers' disintegration, cellular viability and antimicrobial activity were presented as the average\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation (SD) calculated from three repeated measurements.\n\n## Morphology assessment of ribavirin-loaded fibers using SEM\nThe prepared PVP fibers and ribavirin-loaded PVP fibers in Fig. 1 showed successful fiber fabrication criteria of smooth surface, lacked any beads and pores formation, having mean diameters of approximately\u00a0494\u00a0\u00b1\u00a064\u00a0nm and\u00a0406\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088\u00a0nm, respectively. The fabrication blank CD/PVP fibers showed average fiber diameters of 790\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0431\u00a0nm, while the addition of ribavirin nanofibers increased the fibers' diameter to 1,133\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0234\u00a0nm (Fig. 2).Fig. 1SEM images that represent (a) PVP fibers and (b) ribavirin-loaded PVP fibers. The diameter distribution of (c) PVP fibers and (d) ribavirin-loaded PVP fibers showed their average diameters of 494\u00a0\u00b1\u00a064\u00a0nm and 406\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088\u00a0nm, respectively (n\u00a0=\u00a030).Fig. 2SEM images that represent (a) blank PVP/CD fibers and (b) ribavirin-loaded PVP/CD fibers. The distribution of diameter of (c) blank PVP/CD fibers and (d) ribavirin-loaded PVP/CD fibers showed their average fiber diameters of 790\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0431\u00a0nm and 1,133\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0234\u00a0nm, respectively (n\u00a0=\u00a030).\n\n## Characterization of the solid-state using XRD\nThe raw materials' physical state, i.e., ribavirin, CD, PVP and their PM, as well as blank and ribavirin-loaded fibers (fabricated with CD), were all evaluated. As illustrated in Fig. 3, a sequence of intense Bragg reflections was observed in ribavirin raw material, precisely at 2\u03b8: 21\u00b0, 23\u201329\u00b0, 36\u00b0 and 39\u00b0. The pattern of CD exhibited two distinctive sequences of Bragg reflections at 2\u03b8: 32\u00b0 and 46\u00b0, while no distinctive peaks were observed in the PVP polymer pattern (i.e., a broad-halo diffraction). All CD distinctive reflections at 32\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 were also presented in the PM that contained PVP and CD only, while the characteristic peaks of ribavirin at 21\u00b0, 23-29\u00b0, 36\u00b0 and 39\u00b0 were demonstrated in the PM that contained this drug along with PVP and CD, suggesting its presence in the crystalline form. Both blank and ribavirin-loaded nanofibers showed a broad halo diffraction indicating their presence in the amorphous form.Fig. 3XRD patterns of PVP, CD, ribavirin, blank PM (PVP\u00a0+\u00a0CD), ribavirin PM (PVP\u00a0+\u00a0Rib\u00a0+\u00a0CD), blank and ribavirin-loaded PVP/CD nanofibers demonstrating the molecular dispersion of ribavirin in the ribavirin-loaded fibers.

A broad band of O\u2013H stretching was observed between 3600 and 3000\u00a0cm\u22121 for PVP. Furthermore, the peaks at 1660, 1463, and 1293\u00a0cm\u22121 represented the stretching vibrations of the following C\u00a0=\u00a0O, C\u2013H (in the aliphatic compound), and C\u2013N (in aromatic amine), respectively. The FTIR spectrum of the pure ribavirin showed stretching at the function group region representing O\u2013H stretching between 3500 and 3050\u00a0cm\u22121, amine group stretching (\u2013N\u2013H 3450\u00a0cm\u22121), carbonyl group stretching at 1653\u00a0cm\u22121, and the C\u2013N stretching was observed at 1157\u00a0cm\u22121. Other absorption bands at 1086 and 1040\u00a0cm\u22121 of the aliphatic ether group were observed within the ribavirin spectrum. The IR spectrum of the pure CD showed the O\u2013H stretching between 3550 and 3000\u00a0cm\u22121 and absorption bands at 2923\u00a0cm\u22121 that correspond to \u2013CH2\u2013 stretching, 1651\u00a0cm\u22121 that correspond to the carbonyl group stretching, 1459, 1436, 1423\u00a0cm\u22121 that indicate for the \u2013CH\u2013 band vibrations and characteristic C\u2013O/C\u2013C vibrations at 1288\u00a0cm\u22121.Fig. 4FTIR transmissions at a wavenumber range 4000 to 400\u00a0cm\u22121 of (A) PVP, CD, ribavirin, PVP/CD PM, ribavirin/PVP PM, ribavirin/PVP/CD PM, and (B) blank PVP nanofibers, PVP/CD nanofibers, ribavirin-loaded PVP nanofibers and ribavirin-loaded PVP/CD nanofibers. PM, physical mixture; PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone; CD, cyclodextrin; Rib, ribavirin.\nThree PMs were analyzed, PVP/CD, ribavirin/PVP, and ribavirin/PVP/CD (Fig. 4A). The O\u2013H stretching between 3600 and 3000\u00a0cm\u22121, and the carbonyl group stretching at\u00a0\u223c\u00a01652\u00a0cm\u22121 were presented in all three PM spectra. Three distinctive peaks of CD were presented clearly in the PVP/CD and ribavirin/PVP/CD PMs compared to the ribavirin/PVP spectrum, indicating the presence of CD within those PMs. Characteristic peaks of ribavirin at\u00a0\u223c\u00a01070 and 1030\u00a0cm\u22121 (i.e., aliphatic ether group) were shown in the PM that contained ribavirin (ribavirin/PVP, and ribavirin/PVP/CD). Fig. 4B exhibited the FTIR spectra of all prepared nanofiber groups, which observed similar distinctive peaks to the PMs with no noticeable shifts in those peaks.\n\n## Quantification of ribavirin using HPLC\nThe development and application of an HPLC for quantifying ribavirin-loaded fibers demonstrated its precision and reliability in drug separation and identification. The calibration curve yielded favorable outcomes as shown in Fig. 5. The HPLC analysis exhibited a successful separation of ribavirin revealing a separation of the drug in around 4.5\u00a0min (i.e., Rt). The regression equation was y\u00a0=\u00a0291.11x \u2212 55.552 and the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.9991, indicating an excellent linear correlation and effective separation of the drug achieved by this developed method.Fig. 5HPLC calibration curve of ribavirin-loaded nanofibers showed excellent linearity (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.9991).\n\n## Quantification of ribavirin-loaded fibers drug loading (DL) and encapsulation ef",
