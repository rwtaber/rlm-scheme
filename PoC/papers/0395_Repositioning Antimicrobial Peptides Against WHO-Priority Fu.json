Virulence and resistance mechanisms of critical fungal species, elucidate structure\u2013activity relationships (SAR) of antifungal peptides, and assess emerging delivery technologies\u2014including PEGylation, nanoparticle conjugation, and hybridization are examinated. Furthermore, we explore current preclinical and clinical efforts, and highlight opportunities for rational AMP design through computational tools\u2014including machine learning (ML) and its subset, deep learning (DL). While ML encompasses a broad range of statistical and algorithmic approaches, DL refers specifically to neural network\u2010based models capable of extracting hierarchical patterns from complex biological data, such as AMP\u2013fungi interaction matrices or sequence\u2013activity relationships.\n\n## Virulence Factors of Critical Priority Fungi\nIn general, virulence factors can be defined as deleterious tools of pathogenicity, whose function is to ensure the survival and adaptation of fungal organisms in hostile environments.[\n\n14\n, \n15\n\n] According to the WHO list of priority fungal pathogens released in 2022, C. neoformans, A. fumigatus, C. auris, and C. albicans have been classified as critical priority pathogens, primarily due to their remarkable adaptability, ability to evade host defenses, and growing resistance to antifungal agents.[\n\n16\n\n] These fungi exhibit a wide array of virulence mechanisms, including biofilm formation, morphological transitions, secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, thermotolerance, and immune modulation, which contribute to their persistence and pathogenicity (Figure\u00a0\n1\n). A detailed overview of the main virulence mechanisms shared by WHO\u2010designated critical\u2010priority fungi is presented in the following section. These include biofilm formation, morphological plasticity, thermotolerance, secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, and immune evasion\u2014factors that collectively drive pathogenesis, persistence, and antifungal resistance, particularly in immunocompromised and critically ill patients.\n\n## C. neoformans\nC. neoformans is a life\u2010threatening opportunistic pathogen with a multifactorial virulence profile that enables immune evasion, pulmonary colonization, and dissemination to the central nervous system (CNS) via blood\u2013brain barrier penetration. Key virulence factors include a polysaccharide capsule, degradative enzymes (e.g., urease and phospholipase), melanin, mannitol, reproductive type variation, phenotypic switching, and thermotolerance at 37\u00a0\u00b0C.[\n\n17\n, \n18\n\n] The polysaccharide capsule is the major virulence determinant and is composed mainly of glucuronoxylomannanagalactan (GXMGal), galactoxylomannan (GalXM), and mannoproteins.[\n\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n\n] GXMGal and GalXM possess immunomodulatory activities and can impair macrophage function. The capsule also inhibits phagocytosis in the absence of opsonins and protects fungal cells against oxidative stress.[\n\n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n\n]\nDegradative enzymes such as urease and phospholipase facilitate CNS invasion. Urease hydrolyzes urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia, not only supplying nitrogen but also contributing to microvascular epithelial damage and enhancing fungal penetration into the blood\u2010brain barrier.[\n\n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n\n] Phospholipase disrupts cell membranes and tight junctions, promoting translocation across endothelial barriers.[\n\n19\n, \n23\n\n] Melanin is another important virulence factor. This brown/black hydrophobic pigment is synthesized using host catecholamines and enhances resistance to oxidants, acids, and alkalis. Melanin protects the fungus during phagocytosis and is implicated in the neurotropism of C. neoformans.[\n\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n, \n31\n\n] Mannitol plays a similar protective role by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS).[\n\n23\n, \n32\n\n]\nOver time, antifungal resistance in C. neoformans has become a growing concern. Resistance to azoles, especially fluconazole, is increasingly reported, although amphotericin B remains the first\u2010line treatment for systemic cryptococcosis.[\n\n33\n\n] Fluconazole resistance involves multiple mechanisms, such as ERG11 mutations, altered stress response pathways, efflux pump upregulation, and membrane trafficking alterations.[\n\n34\n\n] In particular, the cnAFR1 gene encodes an ABC transporter that actively exports fluconazole, lowering its intracellular concentration and promoting resistance.[\n\n35\n\n] This efflux pump also enhances macrophage resistance, favoring persistent infections.[\n\n36\n\n]\nNotably, capsule plasticity contributes to antifungal resistance. The capsule can enlarge and increase the production of GXM, GalXM, and mannoproteins, reinforcing protection against oxidative stress, radiation, desiccation, and phagocytosis.[\n\n21\n, \n37\n, \n38\n, \n39\n, \n40\n\n] An emerging resistance mechanism involves polyploid Titan cells, which are enlarged cryptococcal cells generated during infection. These cells overexpress genes linked to stress adaptation and capsule/cell wall synthesis, including transcription factors such as Stb4, Zfc3, and Bzp4.[\n\n41\n, \n42\n\n] Titan cell progeny exhibit enhanced fluconazole resistance, attributed to structural adaptations that protect against ROS and phagocytic killing.[\n\n43\n, \n44\n\n]\n\n## A. fumigatus\nA. fumigatus is a thermotolerant, filamentous fungus capable of thriving at 40\u201341\u00a0\u00b0C and its virulence is driven by multiple factors, including nutritional adaptability, immune evasion, and a strong ability to form biofilms, which enable persistence in polymicrobial niches.[\n\n45\n\n] Among its most potent virulence traits is the production of melanized conidia (2\u20133\u00b5m in diameter), as well as a diverse array of secondary metabolites and toxins. These compounds\u2014such as gliotoxins, aflatoxins, fumagillins, helvolic acid, and ribotoxins (e.g., restrictocin and mitogillin)\u2014are key to the pathogen's immune modulation, phagocytosis avoidance, and host tissue colonization.[\n\n46\n, \n47\n, \n48\n, \n49\n, \n50\n, \n51\n, \n52\n\n] The cell wall of A. fumigatus is enriched with structural polysaccharides including \u03b2\u20101,3\u2010glucan, \u03b2\u20101,4\u2010glucan, \u03b1\u20101,3\u2010glucan, chitin, mannans, galactomannans, and chitosan, which provide rigidity while concealing pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns. This structural barrier not only impairs host immune detection but also facilitates biofilm establishment, a process central to antifungal resistance.[\n\n53\n, \n54\n, \n55\n, \n56\n, \n57\n, \n58\n, \n59\n\n]\nBiofilm\u2010associated A. fumigatus exhibits elevated minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) compared to planktonic cells, a phenomenon attributed to extracellular matrix components (e.g., galactosaminogalactan), efflux pumps (AfuMDR1\u20134), eDNA, persister cells, and molecular chaperones like Hsp90.[\n\n47\n, \n60\n, \n61\n\n] The Hsp90\u2013calcineurin and HOG\u2013MAPK signaling pathways further support resistance and adaptation under environmental stress. Recent findings have revealed that A. fumigatus produces oxylipins\u2014oxidized fatty acid derivatives\u2014that modulate both fungal development and host\u2013pathogen interactions. In particular, the oxylipin 5,8\u2010diHODE, synthesized via the fungal oxygenase PpoA and regulated by the transcription factor ZfpA, was shown to protect A. fumigatus against hyphal tip damage induced by echinocandins. This signal also promotes hyphal branching and differentiation, contributing to tissue colonization and immune evasion. Interestingly, 5,8\u2010diHODE and related oxylipins share structural similarities with mammalian lipid mediators, and may interact with host G\u2010protein coupled receptors such as G2A. Indeed, G2A\u2010deficient mice exhibit enhanced neutrophil recruitment and better survival during invasive aspergillosis, suggesting that these fungal molecules may dampen immune responses to favor fungal persistence.[\n\n62\n\n]\nOne of the most critical clinical challenges is the emergence of azole resistance, with global prevalence rates ranging from 6.6% to 28%, depending on geographical region.[\n\n63\n, \n64\n\n] Resistance is frequently associated with biofilm formation, which restricts drug penetration and reduces therapeutic efficacy.[\n\n47\n, \n65\n, \n66\n\n] At the molecular level, azole resistance is predominantly mediated by mutations in the Cyp51A gene, which encodes a 14\u03b1\u2010demethylase enzyme crucial for ergosterol biosynthesis.[\n\n67\n, \n68\n, \n69\n\n] Two isoforms, Cyp51A and Cyp51B, have been described, though resistance is largely attributed to Cyp51A. In particular, tandem repeat (TR) mutations in the Cyp51A promoter region\u2014such as TR34/L98H, TR46/Y121F/T289A, and TR53\u2014lead to gene overexpression and increased resistance. These variants are prevalent in both clinical and environmental settings, indicating widespread strain dissemination.[\n\n70\n, \n71\n\n] Additional mechanisms include: Overexpression of efflux transporters, such as ABC (e.g., AfuMDR1\u20134) and MFS\u2010type transporters, which reduce intracellular azole concentrations;[\n\n72\n, \n73\n, \n74\n\n] non\u2010Cyp51A mutations, such as deletions in afyap1 and aldA, and point mutations like R243Q in AfCox10, affecting sterol synthesis;[\n\n75\n, \n76\n\n] and activation of stress response pathways, including calcium signaling, iron regulation, cell wall integrity, and the Hsp90\u2013calcineurin axis (Figure\u00a0\n2\n).[\n\n77\n, \n78\n, \n79\n, \n80\n, \n81\n\n]\nBiofilm\u2010related resistance in A. fumigatus is multifactorial, involving ECM overproduction, cell dormancy, upregulation of efflux genes like mdr4, cdr1B, and mdr1,[\n\n82\n, \n83\n, \n84\n, \n85\n, \n86\n\n] and retention of eDNA and GAG, which sustain biofilm architecture. Enzymatic degradation of GAG by Sph3 has been shown to potentiate the activity of caspofungin and other antifungals.[\n\n87\n\n] Given the complexity of these resistance mechanisms, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Promising candidates include antifungal peptides such as hLF(1\u201311) and dhvar5, which can act against conidia without causing cytotoxicity to red blood cells.[\n\n88\n\n] Additionally, synergistic approaches, such as combining caspofungin with polymyxin B, have shown efficacy against mixed\u2010species biofilms involving A. fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that combination therapies may offer renewed clinical value.[\n\n83\n\n]\n\n## C. auris\nC. auris has emerged as a multidrug\u2010resistant fungal pathogen, distinguished by a unique set of virulence attributes. These include aggregate formation, secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, remarkable environmental persistence, and resistance to all three major antifungal classes: azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins.[\n\n89\n, \n90\n\n] A notable feature of this pathogen is its tendency to form aggregates of undivided daughter cells, resulting in clusters that exhibit enhanced resistance to antifungal agents. Unlike C. albicans, C. auris does not typically form true hyphae or pseudohyphae, a difference likely attributed to the absence of Candidalysin, a hyphal\u2010specific virulence factor.[\n\n91\n, \n92\n, \n93\n\n] Although it produces less biofilm than C. albicans, the quantity is still sufficient to support pathogenicity.[\n\n94\n\n] Furthermore, host immune responses appear compromised, as neutrophil recruitment during C. auris infection is significantly reduced\u2014by \u224850%\u2014which may impair fungal clearance.[\n\n95\n, \n96\n\n]\nThis pathogen secretes a range of degradative enzymes, such as secreted aspartyl proteinases (SAPs), phospholipases, and hemolysins, which play a role in host tissue invasion, immune evasion, and adhesion.[\n\n97\n, \n98\n\n] However, the expression of these virulence factors can vary among isolates. One of the most alarming traits of C. auris is its robust environmental survival, persisting for extended periods on dry or damp surfaces, facilitating nosocomial transmission and underscoring the need for strict infection control measures.[\n\n99\n, \n100\n, \n101\n\n]\nC. auris causes severe invasive infections, including candidemia and sepsis, with reported mortality rates reaching up to 72%. Resistance is mediated by multiple mechanisms, including mutations in drug targets, transcriptional upregulation of resistance genes, and increased efflux activity, all of which reduce intracellular antifungal concentrations.[\n\n95\n, \n96\n, \n102\n, \n103\n\n]\nAlarmingly, \u224890% of C. auris isolates are resistant to at least one antifungal class, and between 30% and 41% exhibit resistance to all three main antifungal categories, reflecting its highly MDR phenotype.[\n\n104\n, \n105\n, \n106\n\n] While the mechanisms behind amphotericin B resistance remain unclear, they have been linked to alterations in ergosterol biosynthesis, including upregulation of ERG1, ERG2, ERG6, and ERG13.[\n\n107\n\n] Azole resistance correlates with ERG11 gene amplification, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and overexpression of ABC and MFS\u2010type efflux pumps.[\n\n108\n, \n109\n, \n110\n\n] Echinocandin resistance in C. auris has been attributed to mutations in the FKS1 gene, particularly at S639 within Hotspot 1, impairing the function of \u03b2\u20101,3\u2010glucan synthase and thereby reducing drug\u2010binding efficiency.[\n\n111\n\n]\nTo further elucidate the interaction between C. auris and host barriers, ex vivo skin models developed by Seiser et\u00a0al.[\n\n111\n\n] demonstrated that C. auris fails to penetrate intact human epidermis but readily colonizes damaged skin\u2014especially via hair follicles or mechanically disrupted sites. During dermal invasion, a shift toward pseudohyphal morphology was observed, suggesting an adaptive response to the microenvironment and emphasizing the importance of skin integrity in preventing fungal spread. In vivo studies by Areitio et\u00a0al.[\n\n112\n\n] support the heightened virulence of non\u2010aggregative C. auris strains, which exhibited increased renal pathology, granulomatous inflammation, and a greater fungal burden in the kidneys and spleen, when compared to aggregative variants.\nRecent studies have revealed that C. auris can adopt an aggregative morphotype during systemic infection, characterized by clustered cell growth and enhanced tissue persistence (Figure\u00a0\n3\n).[\n\n113\n\n] This phenotype displays preferential tropism for the central nervous system, reduced phagocytic clearance, and partial resistance to host\u2010derived AMPs such as LL\u201037 and PACAP. Genomic analyses of evolved isolates have revealed mutations in regulators of cytokinesis and polarity\u2014including CHS1, BNI1, CAS4, and ACE2\u2014implicating a genetically encoded morphological switch. Interestingly, while aggregation facilitates immune evasion and dissemination, non\u2010aggregative strains exhibit stronger biofilm formation, greater tissue invasiveness, and higher antifungal tolerance in some settings\n\n## C. albicans\nC. albicans is among the most comprehensively investigated fungal pathogens, particularly with respect to its diverse virulence strategies. These mechanisms include adherence to host and abiotic surfaces, tissue invasion, phenotypic plasticity, secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, biofilm development, nutrient adaptability, fungal thigmotropism, evasion of immune surveillance, and resistance to conventional antifungals, as well as oxidative stress tolerance.[\n\n114\n, \n115\n\n] A key virulence trait of C. albicans is its morphological versatility, notably its capacity to switch between yeast and filamentous forms (hyphae and pseudohyphae), a transition essential for tissue invasion and systemic dissemination. This morphogenetic shift also promotes the expression of virulence\u2010associated proteins such as candidalysins, adhesins, and invasins.[\n\n115\n, \n116\n, \n117\n\n] Interestingly, this dimorphism modulates the host immune response: yeast forms typically elicit Th1 responses, whereas hyphal forms are associated with Th2 immunity.[\n\n116\n, \n118\n\n]\nFollowing biofilm formation, the shedding of yeast cells enables wider dissemination, supporting systemic spread, immune evasion, and enhanced antifungal resistance.[\n\n47\n, \n119\n, \n120\n\n] Simultaneously, C. albicans produces secreted SAPs and phospholipases (PLB\u2010A to D), which promote tissue damage and facilitate host invasion.[\n\n116\n, \n117\n, \n121\n, \n122\n\n] Antifungal resistance in C. albicans is particularly prevalent among patients receiving long\u2010term azole prophylaxis, such as those with HIV/AIDS or oropharyngeal candidiasis, although resistance may be transient in some cases.[\n\n123\n, \n124\n, \n125\n, \n126\n\n] Critically, biofilm formation enhances antifungal tolerance\u2014by up to 1000\u2010fold compared to planktonic cells, primarily by delaying fungicidal activity rather than increasing MIC values.[\n\n127\n\n] This is largely attributed to efflux pump systems, such as the ABC transporters Cdr1 and Cdr2 and the MFS transporter Mdr1, which actively extrude antifungal agents.[\n\n126\n, \n128\n, \n129\n\n] Although deleting these genes improves fluconazole susceptibility in free\u2010floating cells, this benefit does not extend to mature biofilms.[\n\n130\n, \n131\n\n] The Hsp90 molecular chaperone plays a pivotal role in antifungal resistance by stabilizing key stress\u2010response regulators like calcineurin and Mkc1, which act within the Pkc1\u2010MAPK signaling cascade essential for cell wall integrity.[\n\n130\n, \n132\n, \n133\n, \n134\n\n] Beyond azoles, C. albicans may also exhibit cross\u2010resistance to echinocandins, frequently due to mutations in the FKS1 gene, which impair glucan synthase binding and elevate MIC values\u2014contributing to multidrug resistance and nosocomial outbreaks.[\n\n131\n, \n135\n, \n136\n\n]\n\n## Current Limitations in Antifungal Treatment\nDespite the vast array of antibacterial agents available, the therapeutic options for fungal infections remain severely restricted. Presently, antifungal pharmacotherapy is limited to four primary drug classes\u2014azoles, echinocandins, polyenes, and pyrimidine analogs\u2014each targeting a narrow spectrum of fungal\u2010specific processes such as ergosterol biosynthesis, nucleic acid replication, and \u03b2\u20101,3\u2010glucan synthesis.[\n\n137\n, \n138\n, \n139\n\n] For instance, flucytosine, a pyrimidine analog, is rarely administered as monotherapy for invasive fungal infections due to its narrow therapeutic window and rapid onset of resistance. A critical challenge across all antifungal classes is toxicity. Amphotericin B, although highly effective, is known for nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects, necessitating close monitoring of renal and hepatic function.[\n\n140\n, \n141\n\n] Flucytosine can cause bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity, especially in patients with pre\u2010existing renal conditions. Azoles, such as fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole, are generally better tolerated but still pose risks of hepatotoxicity and cytochrome P450\u2010mediated drug interactions. Voriconazole, in particular, is linked to visual disturbances and photosensitivity. Echinocandins\u2014including caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin\u2014are often regarded as the safest option, though they require intravenous administration and are associated with high costs.[\n\n142\n\n]\nEach antifungal class presents limitations not only in spectrum and resistance potential but also in the nature of its activity\u2014ranging from fungistatic growth inhibition to fungicidal killing, a distinction with important clinical implications.[\n\n143\n\n] Fungicidal agents actively kill fungal cells, leading to irreversible loss of viability, whereas fungistatic agents merely inhibit growth, relying on host immunity to clear the infection. This distinction is clinically relevant, particularly in immunocompromised patients where fungistatic drugs may fail to achieve clearance.[\n\n144\n\n] For instance, echinocandins are fungicidal against most Candida spp. but only fungistatic against Aspergillus spp., while azoles are predominantly fungistatic across a broad range of fungi.[\n\n6\n\n]\nAlthough Amphotericin B remains active against many clinically relevant fungi\u2014including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and C. neoformans\u2014its toxicity restricts its use. Azoles, while effective against C. albicans, show limited efficacy against C. glabrata and C. krusei, with rising resistance reported. Their extensive use, both in healthcare and agriculture, has driven azole resistance, particularly in A. fumigatus and multidrug\u2010resistant C. auris.[\n\n145\n, \n146\n\n] Echinocandins are fungicidal against Candida spp. and fungistatic against Aspergillus spp.; however, Cryptococcus spp. are inherently resistant due to the absence of \u03b2\u20101,3\u2010glucan in their cell wall.[\n\n147\n, \n148\n\n] Flucytosine is primarily reserved for combination therapy, such as with Amphotericin B in cryptococcal meningitis, to mitigate resistance emergence and its use as monotherapy is discouraged due to high mutation\u2010driven resistance.[\n\n149\n\n]\nThe overuse of azoles in both medicine and agriculture has contributed to the emergence of azole\u2010resistant strains, particularly A. fumigatus, now associated with mortality rates up to 88% in specific populations.[\n\n150\n, \n151\n, \n152\n, \n153\n\n] In pathogenic yeasts like C. albicans, C. auris, and C. glabrata, resistance is often due to mutations in ERG11 or overexpression of efflux pumps (e.g., CDR1, CDR2, MDR1). In filamentous fungi like A. fumigatus, mutations in cyp51A and cyp51B are prevalent.[\n\n154\n, \n155\n, \n156\n\n] Alarmingly, C. auris exhibits resistance rates up to 90% for fluconazole, 50% for voriconazole, and 15\u201330% for Amphotericin B.[\n\n148\n, \n157\n\n] Although echinocandin resistance is still uncommon, it is rising in Candida spp. due to mutations in FKS1 and FKS2, which impair glucan synthase binding.[\n\n158\n, \n159\n\n] In A. fumigatus, resistance to echinocandins has also been detected. Additionally, C. neoformans is intrinsically resistant to echinocandins due to differences in cell wall structure and enzyme profiles. While Amphotericin B resistance remains rare, isolated cases in C. albicans and C. auris have been reported, often associated with mutations in ergosterol biosynthesis or responses to oxidative stress.[\n\n147\n, \n160\n\n] Despite increasing incidence and resistance rates, the antifungal development pipeline remains limited, with few compounds advancing to late\u2010stage clinical trials. Innovation is hindered by high development costs, the eukaryotic nature of fungi, and limited druggable targets that differentiate them from human cells.[\n\n161\n\n] New drug classes, including orotomides (e.g., olorofim) and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors, are under investigation but have not yet achieved broad regulatory approval. The sustained rise in invasive fungal infections\u2014exacerbated by global health crises such as COVID\u201019\u2014underscores the need for targeted and scalable antifungal solutions.[\n\n161\n, \n162\n\n]\nPriority fungal pathogens possess a wide array of virulence traits that enable tissue invasion through immune evasion and intrinsic or acquired resistance to antifungal agents.[\n\n16\n, \n163\n\n] These include biofilm formation, hyphal transition, secretion of hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., proteases and phospholipases), immune modulation, phenotypic plasticity, cellular aggregation, and stress tolerance.[\n\n164\n, \n165\n\n] These mechanisms contribute not only to the establishment of infection but also to reduced susceptibility to conventional antifungal agents\u2014particularly in the context of biofilms, which are often labeled as resistant but typically reflect antifungal tolerance. Unlike true resistance, tolerance does not involve an increase in MIC values, but allows fungal cells to persist under drug exposure by entering a transient, protected state,[\n\n166\n\n] This context underscores an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies capable of directly targeting and disarming these essential virulence mechanisms to effectively overcome pathogenic fungi.[\n\n167\n\n] Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a promising class of antifungal agents with multifactorial mechanisms of action that extend beyond membrane disruption, directly interfering with key fungal virulence factors such as biofilm formation and maturation,[\n\n167\n, \n168\n\n] by suppressing morphological transitions such as hyphal development, neutralizing secreted hydrolytic enzymes, and restoring immune detection by unmasking \u03b2\u2010glucans or enhancing fungal immunogenicity.[\n\n169\n, \n170\n, \n171\n\n]\n\n## AMPs: A Promising Alternative to Conventional Antifungals\nA promising substitute for the current arsenal and the increasing resistance to traditional antifungals would be AMPs, immune response effector molecules made by different species or synthesized. These molecules are short to medium\u2010length peptides (5\u2013100 amino acids), which have a broad antimicrobial spectrum and also mediate inflammation, proliferation, immunomodulation, and cytokine release.[\n\n172\n, \n173\n, \n174\n\n] Among other things, these peptides can be \u03b1\u2010helices, \u03b2\u2010sheets, or a combination of both. They can also have a variety of modes of action, including 1) pore creation upon interaction with membranes, 2) effect on cell walls, and 3) suppression of nucleic acids.[\n\n11\n, \n175\n, \n176\n, \n177\n\n]\nIn addition to the previously mentioned mechanisms, peptides with antifungal activity have intricate ways of influencing intracellular structures and functions such as ROS production, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, autophagy, and cell cycles by interacting with the surface of fungal cells.[\n\n178\n, \n179\n\n] Singomycins, iturins, polioxins, echinocandins, leucinostatins, and Skin\u2010PYY are among the peptide families that have already been described for priority species; nevertheless, the most of them are primarily active against C. albicans.[\n\n177\n\n] While some AMPs exhibit fungicidal activity and act through multiple mechanisms that may reduce the likelihood of classical resistance, emerging studies have identified adaptive responses\u2014including cell wall remodeling, protease secretion, and membrane composition changes\u2014that suggest fungi can develop tolerance or even resistance under prolonged exposure. These findings underscore the need for ongoing surveillance and mechanistic studies before broadly assuming a low resistance potential.[\n\n175\n, \n180\n\n]\n\n## Biological Mechanisms of AMPs Against Fungi\nAntifungal peptides (AFPs) are cationic molecules with an affinity for cell membranes, whose activity is influenced by properties such as the composition of hydrophobic residues, chain length, and the amphiphilic nature of the sequence, factors that determine their secondary structure and mode of action.[\n\n181\n\n] AFPs constitute a distinct subset of AMPs with selective activity against pathogenic fungi. These molecules, which occur naturally or are chemically optimized, have been designed to enhance structural stability, resist proteolytic degradation, and increase antifungal potency.[\n\n177\n\n] Although few have progressed into late\u2010stage clinical trials, several AFPs have shown encouraging results in preclinical models, particularly against Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp., which account for the majority of invasive fungal infections in humans.[\n\n182\n\n] Unlike conventional antifungal agents that typically act on a single molecular target\u2014such as ergosterol biosynthesis or \u03b2\u2010glucan synthesis\u2014AFPs often exert their effects through a combination of mechanisms that include direct membrane disruption, intracellular interference, and inhibition of cell wall assembly. In parallel, many AFPs modulate the host immune response, enhancing antifungal defense pathways. This multifactorial mode of action positions AFPs as attractive candidates for the development of next\u2010generation antifungal therapeutics, especially in the face of rising resistance to existing drugs.\n\n## Membrane Disruption and Permeabilization\nThe plasma membrane plays a pivotal role in fungal physiology, acting as a selective barrier that controls molecular traffic and mediates interactions with the surrounding environment. The ability of pathogenic fungi to endure environmental stress and evade immune detection is influenced not only by the cell wall but also by the biochemical composition of the plasma membrane, which contributes to membrane fluidity, permeability, and stress response.[\n\n183\n\n] Distinct biochemical features differentiate bacterial from fungal membranes, influencing the susceptibility of each to antimicrobial agents.
