  "abstract": "With the resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic, the repositioning of FDA-approved drugs against coronovirus and finding alternative strategies for antiviral therapy are both important. We previously identified the viral lipid envelope as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection with plant alkaloids (Shekunov et al., 2021).

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nBy the beginning of 2023, the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2022, World Health Organization Coronavirus,) reported approximately 750\u00a0000\u00a0000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 6\u00a0800\u00a0000 deaths. The search for new antiviral drugs and approaches remains a high priority.\nInfection by various enveloped viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), requires fusion between the viral lipid envelope and the host plasma or endosomal membrane. The process of fusion of two membranes takes place in several successive stages with the formation of certain lipid intermediates (Teissier and P\u00e9cheur, 2007; Teissier et al., 2010; Risselada et al., 2014). In the last decade, the idea has been circulating in the literature that using active small molecules to change the physical properties of the lipid matrix of fusing membranes can prevent virus entry and infection (St Vincent et al., 2010; Vigant et al., 2014). An effective fusion inhibitor aimed at impeding such membrane fusion may emerge as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. From this point of view, antimicrobial lipopeptides (usually composed of peptide heads and fatty acid tails) should be of great interest due to their amphiphilic nature and conical shape. The promotion of positive curvature stress by lipopeptides is believed to inhibit the formation of fusion intermediates with negative curvature. In particular, Yuan et al. (2018) found that a cyclic lipopeptide from Bacillus subtilis, surfactin, can suppress the proliferation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus in epithelial cells in a relatively low concentration range (15\u201350\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), without cytotoxicity or viral membrane disruption. A simple synthetic lipopeptide myr-WD has been shown to successfully combat type 1 influenza virus (H1N1) and murine coronavirus infections (Sardar et al., 2021). The authors of both cited works associated the antiviral effect of the lipopeptides with the suppression of the fusion of the viral and cell membranes by altering their properties.\nHere, we studied the effects of 11 cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) on membrane fusion triggered by calcium, polyethylene glycol 8000, and a short fragment of SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide 1 (816-SFIEDLLFNKVT-827). The choice of CLPs was determined by proven wide-spectrum pharmacological activity against bacteria and fungi; in particular, well-known drugs such as polymyxin B, daptomycin, and echinocandins (caspofungin and anidulafungin) were tested. Changes in the elastic properties of membranes associated with the introduction of CLPs were assessed using differential scanning microcalorimetry and confocal fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of CLPs on membrane fusion is related to the disordering of membrane lipids, the induction of positive curvature stress and enhancing raft formation. Finally, we found that aculeacin A, anidulafugin, iturin A, and mycosubtilin act as potent membrane fusion inhibitors combating SARS-CoV-2.\n\n## Materials and methods\nExperimental procedures, materials and methods are provided in Supplementary material.\n\n## CLPs are able to inhibit liposome fusion\nWe analyzed the effects of aculeacin A, anidulafungin, caspofungin, fengycin, iturin A, mycosubtilin, surfactin, syringostatin A, syringotoxin B, daptomycin, and polymyxin B, on the fusion of membranes of various compositions triggered by calcium, polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG-8000), and a short fragment of SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide 1 (816-SFIEDLLFNKVT-827, FPSARS(816-827)). A schematic representation of the structures of the CLPs used is shown in Fig. 1\n. All compounds are characterized by an amphiphilic structure composed of a cyclic peptide \u201chead\u201d (containing 6 to 10 amino acid residues) and a \u201ctail\u201d (predominantly represented by a hydrocarbon chain).Fig. 1Schematic representation of the chemical structures of the tested CLPs. Information about CLP structures is taken from (Yamaguchi et al., 1985; Sorensen et al., 1996; Tsuge et al., 1996; Aranda et al., 2005; Cai et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2018; Heidary et al., 2018; H\u00fcttel, 2021). The red circles indicate positively charged amino acid residues, blue indicates negatively charged amino acid residues, green indicates neutral polar amino acid residues, and gray indicates neutral hydrophobic amino acid residues.Noncanonical amino acids: Dab, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid; Dhb, 2,3-dehydroaminobutyric acid; Hse, homoserine; Orn, ornithine; Kyn, kynurenic acid.Fig. 1\nFig. 2a shows the time dependence of the percentage of fusion (% fusion) of negatively charged vesicles triggered by the calcium cations in the absence (black curve) and presence of the tested CLPs (curves of appropriate colors). The liposomes were composed of DOPC/DOPG/CHOL (40/40/20\u00a0mol.%). Control samples were not modified with CLPs. CLPs were added to the experimental samples and incubated with vesicles for 35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0min. The decrease in % fusion of liposomes pretreated with CLPs indicates the ability of the tested compounds to inhibit the calcium-induced fusion of the negatively charged vesicles. To compare the antifusogenic ability of different CLPs, we applied the maximum value of % fusion in the presence of appropriate CLPs averaged over several independent experiments. The values are summarized in Table 1\n. The value of % fusion decreased in the series: control\u00a0\u2248\u00a0surfactin\u00a0\u2248\u00a0daptomycin\u00a0\u2265\u00a0syringostatin A\u00a0>\u00a0polymyxin B\u00a0\u2248\u00a0iturin\u00a0>\u00a0syringotoxin B\u00a0>\u00a0aculeacin A\u00a0\u2248\u00a0mycosubtilin\u00a0>\u00a0anidulafungin\u00a0\u2248\u00a0caspofungin\u00a0\u2248\u00a0fengycin. Taking into account the inverse relationship between % fusion and the efficiency of the antifusogenic action of CLPs, we use one more parameter for further consideration, the percentage of inhibition (% inhibition). The diagram presenting mean values of % inhibition by different CLPs is shown in Fig. 3\na (DOPC/DOPG/CHOL, CaCl2). We found that eight CLPs, aculeacin A, anidulafungin, fengycin, syringotoxin B, caspofungin, mycosubtilin, iturin A, and polymyxin B, were able to significantly inhibit calcium-mediated fusion of DOPC/DOPG/CHOL liposomes.Fig. 2Time dependence of the percentage of fusion (% fusion) of liposomes composed of DOPC/DOPG/CHOL (40/40/20\u00a0mol.%) (a), DOPC/CHOL (80/20\u00a0mol.%) (b), and POPC/SM/CHOL (60/20/20\u00a0mol.%) (c) mediated by 40\u00a0mM CaCl2, 20\u00a0wt% PEG-8000, and 150\u00a0\u03bcm FPSARS(816-827) respectively. The relationship between the color and the CLP is shown on the figure. Control samples were not modified with CLPs. % fusion was calculated using a calcein leakage fluorescence assay.

The replacing calcium with PEG-8000 did not significantly affect the inhibitory effects of CLPs on the fusion of DOPC/DOPG/CHOL vesicles (Fig. 3a, DOPC/DOPG/CHOL, PEG-8000). The exclusion of DOPG from the liposome composition had more dramatic consequences (Fig. 2b, Table 1). Only three CLPs, aculeacin A, caspofungin, and fengycin, were able to drastically suppress the PEG-8000-mediated fusion of liposomes composed of DOPC/CHOL (80/20\u00a0mol.%) (Table 1, Fig. 3a, DOPC/CHOL, PEG-8000). Thus, we concluded that the ability of CLPs to inhibit vesicle fusion strictly depended on their membrane composition (DOPC/DOPG/CHOL vs DOPC/CHOL), while the type of fusion trigger (CaCl2\nvs PEG-8000) was less important.\nTo mimic SARS-CoV-2 fusion with cell membranes, we examined the effects of CLPs on the fusion of vesicles composed of POPC/SM/CHOL (60/20/20\u00a0mol.%) mediated by FPSARS(816-827) (Fig. 2c, Table 1). Nine CLPs were shown to inhibit the fusion of POPC/SM/CHOL liposomes triggered by the virus peptide; and efficiency reduced in the series: fengycin\u00a0\u2248\u00a0syringostatin A\u00a0\u2248\u00a0syringotoxin B\u00a0\u2248\u00a0caspofungin\u00a0\u2248\u00a0mycosubtilin\u00a0>\u00a0iturin A\u00a0\u2248\u00a0daptomycin\u00a0\u2265\u00a0aculeacin A\u00a0\u2248\u00a0anidulafungin (Fig. 3a, POPC/SM/CHOL, FPSARS(816-827)). We cannot fully exclude the possibility that CLPs could interact with the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide and prevent specific rearrangements of the lipid matrix under its action. However, docking analysis revealed that daptomycin and surfactin were characterized by approximately 2-fold better efficacy of binding with the spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 than iturin A but 2-fold lower efficacy than the leading compounds (Chowdhury et al., 2021). These data are not consistent with the results presented in Table 1 and Fig. 3a, demonstrating that the revealed ability of CLPs to inhibit vesicle fusion under the action of FPSARS(816-827) was not likely to be due to their specific binding to the fusion peptide.\n\n## Antiviral activity of CLPs against SARS-CoV-2\nFurther, we examined whether the tested CLPs were active against SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, viruses were grown in Vero cells for 24\u00a0h in the presence of two-fold dilutions of the CLPs (m.o.i. 0.01) with further end-point titration of the viral progeny. The results of the assay are presented in Table 2\n. It shows that aculeacin \u0410, anidulafungin, iturin A, and mycosubtilin demonstrated pronounced antiviral properties; at maximal non-toxic concentrations the lipopeptides decreased the infectious activity of the virus by 2.5, 3.5, 2.0 and 2.5 logs, respectively, compared to the control value. The antiviral action of anidulafungin against SARS-CoV-2 was also revealed by Jeon et al. (2020). Aculeacin \u0410 and mycosubtilin were the most potent inhibitors of the virus with the selectivity index (SI) of 47 and 41, respectively (Table 2). Caspofungin was less toxic among the CLPs tested (its 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC\n50) was more than 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), but it had not antiviral effect at these concentrations. Surfactin, daptomycin, and polymyxin B appeared to be highly toxic for Vero cells with CC\n50 of 0.61, 0.74 and 1.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively; and the antiviral activity of these lipopeptides was not detected at lower concentrations.Table 2Cytotoxicity of CLPs against Vero cells and their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.Table 2CLPCC50, \u03bcg/mLaIC50, \u03bcg/mLblgTCID50/mLcSIdAculeacin \u041061\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33.047Anidulafungin42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.02.08Caspofungin>200>2005.51Iturin \u0410136\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01111.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.03.512Mycosubtilin115\u00a0\u00b1\u00a082.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43.041Surfactin0.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10>0.45.51Daptomycin0.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10>0.45.51Polymyxin B1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2>0.85.51PlaceboNANA5.5NAa\u2013 The 50% cytotoxic concentration of CLPs.b\u2013 The 50% virus-inhibiting concentration of CLPs.c\u2013 Viral progeny titer at the maximal non-toxic concentration of CLPs.d\u2013 CLP selectivity index, ratio of CC50 to IC50.\nWith the exception of caspofungin and daptomycin, the antiviral activity of CLPs was qualitatively consistent with their ability to suppress the fusion of POPC/SM/CHOL vesicles induced by FPSARS(816-827) (Fig. 2c, Table 1, Fig. 3a). Aculeacin \u0410, anidulafungin, iturin A, and mycosubtilin A demonstrated both antifusogenic and antiviral properties (Fig. 3a, Table 2). The quantitative disagreements between the antiviral and the inhibitory efficiency of CLPs might be related to a variety of mechanisms of the antiviral action of CLPs. In particular, docking analysis revealed that iturin and anidulafungin might target ACE2-spike protein interaction (Chowdhury et al., 2021; Ahamad et al., 2022). Moreover, based on the in silico results, anidulafungin is also believed to interact with a number of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins (Dey et al., 2021; Anwaar et al., 2022). A possible explanation of the absence of the antiviral action of caspofungin (Table 2) despite its pronounced inhibitory effect on liposome fusion (Fig. 2c, Table 1, Fig. 3a) might be associated to its accumulation in the cells and interaction with intracellular targets resulting in increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration (M\u00fcller et al., 2020; Sattarzadeh Badkoubeh et al., 2022). The lack of the antiviral effects of surfactin and polymyxin B can be explained by their inability to inhibit liposome fusion triggered by the fragment of SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide (Fig. 2c, Table 1, Fig. 3a, POPC/SM/CHOL, FPSARS(816-827)). Probably, the moderate antifusogenic activity of daptomycin (Fig. 2c, Table 1, Fig. 3a, POPC/SM/CHOL, FPSARS(816-827)) along with its high toxicity observed (Table 2) did not allow detecting of its antiviral activity in the cell model used.\nTo further assess the antiviral activity of CLPs, we studied the ability of aculeacin \u0410, anidulafungin, iturin A, and mycosubtilin to block the virus\u2019 activity after previous incubation with extracellular virions. The results suggested that the development of virus-specific cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was strongly suppressed in presence of the CLPs. Indeed, after 48\u00a0h of cultivation, an advanced CPE was observed in the control wells with virus (Fig. 4\n, 48\u00a0h, Positive control). This was seen as cell rounding and partial destruction of the cell monolayer (compared to Negative control). After pre-incubation of the virus with mycosubtilin at a concentration of 12.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL almost complete absence of viral CPE and cell damage was observed (Figs. 4 and 48h, Mycosubtilin). The same effect was observed when iturin A was used. Indeed, at a concentration of 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL it prevented the destruction of the cell monolayer and strongly reduced the number of rounded cells compared to the positive control (Figs. 4 and 48h, Iturin A). In the wells with aculeacin A and anidulafungin, a slight destruction of the monolayer and a small number of rounded cells were observed (data not shown). Thus, the results clearly demonstrated that the effect of CPLs on SARS-CoV-2 virions after their co-incubation disrupts the process of fusion of the viral and cell membranes. This was expressed in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific CPE development in Vero cells. The protective effects of iturin A and mycosubtilin were expressed even after 72\u00a0h, although the number of virus-altered cells increased (Figs. 4 and 72\u00a0h, Mycosubtilin and Iturin A). Anidulafungin and aculeacin A practically did not reduce virus CPE after 72\u00a0h (data not shown). This might indicate that CLP-induced changes in virus lipid envelope were reversible (due to decrease in CLP concentration at cell washing). We cannot fully exclude the possibility that some virions remained infectious after co-incubation with CLPs, and the development of CPE was not completely prevented, it was only delayed.Fig. 4Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect by CLPs. 103 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 virus was incubated with CLPs for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C following by infecting of Vero cells for 1\u00a0h with further washing of unbound virions and incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 48 and 72\u00a0h. The appearance of cell monolayer is presented. Positive control shows infected Vero cells in the absence of CLPs; mycosubtilin and iturin A concentration was equal to12.5 and 25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively; negative control presents untreated Vero cells (without virus and CLPs). Scale bar: 100\u00a0\u03bcm (150\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0magnification).Fig. 4\n\n## CLP-induced alteration in membrane electrostatic properties\nAt neutral pH, caspofungin, fengycin, syringostatin A, syringotoxin B, and polymyxin B have a net positive electric charge, while surfactin and daptomycin are negatively charged (Fig. 1, Table 1). Considering the key role of electrostatic interactions in the initial stages of the fusion of negatively charged liposomes under the action of calcium cations, it can be assumed that positively charged CLPs should slow down the calcium-mediated fusion of DOPG-enriched vesicles, while negatively charged CLPs should act in the opposite manner. To examine this idea, we analyzed the kinetics of vesicle fusion in the absence and presence of CLPs (Table 1). The Pearson coefficient of correlation between the time constant, \u03c4, characterizing the exponential dependence of calcein leakage at calcium-mediated fusion of DOPC/DOPG/CHOL liposomes on time, and the net charges of the tested CLP molecules, was equal to 0.6. This confirmed the importance of charge\u2012charge interactions in the system, although the average correlation indicated that this was not the only factor affecting the characteristic time.\nThe short fragment of SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide 1 used, FPSARS(816-827), has a net negative charge. Therefore, an adsorption of positively and negatively charged CLPs on neutral liposomes composed of POPC/SM/CHOL might promote and arrest the fusion peptide interaction with the membrane, respectively. No correlation was observed between the time constant, \u03c4, characterizing the exponential dependence of calcein leakage at FPSARS(816-827)-mediated fusion of POPC/SM/CHOL vesicles on time, and the net charges of the tested CLP molecules (Table 1), indicating that charge\u2012charge interactions were not of key importance in alteration of peptide-induced fusion by CLPs. However, this did not exclude the probability of CLP influence on the electrostatic interactions between the fusion peptide and the membrane via dipole potential modulation. For example, the alteration in the membrane dipole potential was shown to affect the extent of the membrane fusion caused by the simian immunodeficiency virus fusion peptide and implicated the dipolar properties of membranes in the fusion (Cladera et al., 1999). Moreover, the S2 SARS-CoV fusion protein was shown to reduce the dipole potential of the bilayer (Guill\u00e9n et al., 2008). To test the possibility we additionally examined the effects of CLPs on the boundary potential of POPC/SM/CHOL (60/20/20\u00a0mol.%) bilayers. Table 1 shows that the changes in the membrane boundary potential (\u0394\u03c6\nb) upon the addition of anidulafungin, caspofungin, fengycin, iturin A, surfactin, syringostatin A, syringotoxin B, daptomycin, and polymyxin B at the concentrations used in a fusion assay did not exceed 16\u00a0mV. The addition of aculeacin An up to 1\u00a0\u03bcM significantly reduced the membrane boundary potential by 70\u00a0mV (Table 1). Considering the results presented in Table 1, we concluded that there was no relation between the abilities of CLPs to alter the fusion and to modify the boundary potential of SM-enriched membranes (and its components, including dipole potential).\n\n## Antifusogenic activity depends on CLP tail length\nThe CLPs tested differ not only in the charge of their peptide heads but also in the length of their hydrophobic tails (Fig. 1). We have performed a series of semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations of the geometry of CLP molecules in order to estimate the lengths of the hydrophobic tails, l (Table 1). Comparison between the left panel of Fig. 3a, presenting CLPs in order of decreasing l-value (top to bottom), and the right panel, showing the diagrams of % inhibition by various CLPs in four different model systems, indicates that as a rule, the longer the tail, the higher the antifusogenic activity. The corresponding Pearson coefficient of correlation between the % inhibition and l varies in the range from 0.5 to 0.7 depending on the combination of the liposome composition and the type of fusion trigger used (Fig. 3b). A similar conclusion was made by Kracht et al. (1999) that demonstrated lower antiviral activity against VSV, SFV, and SHV-1 of surfactin with fatty acid chain of 13 carbon atoms compared to C14 and C15 isoforms. Karamov et al. (2022) also showed enhancing virucidal activity of cationic surfactants against SARS-CoV-2 at increasing the length of hydrophobic tail. The observed relationship between the antifusogenic activity of lipopeptides and the length of their tails (Fig. 3a and b) might indicate that CLPs affect membrane fusion by altering lipid packing. In our recent work (Shekunov et al., 2021), we showed that the antifusogenic activity of alkaloids is related to their membrane disordering effect.\n\n## Disordering action of CLPs\nTo gain mechanistic insight into the CLP-induced changes in lipid ordering, we conducted differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSmC) measurements with a DPPC/CHOL (90/10\u00a0mol.%) mixture. The melting temperature (T\nm) of the untreated vesicles was equal to 40.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00b0C. The width of the melting peak at half-height (T\n1/2), which is related to sharpness of the gel-to-liquid-crystalline (L\u03b2/L\u03b1) phase transition, was approximately 0.7\u00a0\u00b0C. Fig. 5\nshows that aculeacin A (a), anidulafungin (b), caspofungin (c), fengycin (d), and iturin A (e) were able to affect DPPC/CHOL melting in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the surfactin (f), daptomycin (g), and polymyxin B (h) had negligible ability to modulate DPPC/CHOL thermotropic behavior. The ability of CLPs to reduce T\nm increased in the following series: aculeacin A\u00a0\u2264\u00a0caspofungin\u00a0\u2264\u00a0iturin A\u00a0<\u00a0anidulafungin\u00a0<<\u00a0fengycin at all tested lipid:CLP ratios (50:1, 25:1, and 10:1) (Table 3\n). The ability to enhance T\n1/2 increased in the following series: iturin A\u00a0\u2248\u00a0aculeacin A\u00a0\u2264\u00a0anidulafungin\u00a0\u2248\u00a0caspofungin\u00a0<\u00a0fengycin (Table 3). In addition to increasing T\n1/2, the decrease in melting cooperativity was expressed as a 1.3\u20131.5-fold drop in the cooperative unit size (CUS) in the presence of caspofungin at lipid:CLP ratios of 25:1 and 10:1 and fengycin at lipid:CLP ratios of 50:1 and 25:1 (Table 3). Good profile matching from two repeated heating steps (\u0394T\nm1-m2 was close to zero, Table 3) indicated the equilibrium distribution of CLPs between lipid monolayers. The introduction of anidulafungin, caspofungin, and fengycin up to low lipid:CLP ratios (25:1 and 10:1) turned the main peak into a multicomponent profile consisting of two overlapping transitions (Fig. 5b,c,d, insets). This might indicate the formation of at least two lipid phases with different concentrations of CLPs: the right component (peak #1), characterized by a higher melting point, might be attributed to a practically pure DPPC/CHOL mixture, and the left component (peak #2), characterized by a lower melting point, should be related to CLP-enriched lipid domains. The invariability in the T\nm-hysteresis (\u0394T\nh, the difference in the melting temperature between heating and cooling scans) with increasing concentrations of CLPs indicated the absence of lipid interdigitation in the presence of CLPs (Table 3).Fig. 5Heating thermograms of the gel-to-liquid-crystalline (L\u03b2/L\u03b1) phase transition of DPPC/CHOL (90/10\u00a0mol.%) in the absence (control, black curves) and presence of aculeacin A (a), anidulafungin (b), caspofungin (c), fengycin (d), iturin A (e), surfactin (f), daptomycin (g), and polymyxin B (h). The lipid:CLP molar ratio is equal to 50:1 (orange curves), 25:1 (dark yellow curves) and 10:1 (dark blue curves).

The THII of pure POPE was equal to 70.1\u00a0\u00b0C.a\u2013 The value is taken from Grau et al. (2000) at a DEPE:iturin A molar ratio of 20:1.b\u2013 The value is taken from Yuan et al. (2018) at a DEPE:surfactin molar ratio of 33:1.\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient between the % inhibition of the CLPs of CaCl2-, PEG-8000- and FP-SARS-CoV-2-induced liposome fusion and the \u0394T\n1/2-values at all tested lipid:CLP ratios varied in the range of 0.5\u20130.9 (Fig. 3b), indicating the possible relation of antifusogenic and disordering abilities of CLPs.\n\n## CLPs induce positive curvature stress\nAnother possible mechanism for the antifusogenic action of CLPs might be related to their ability to induce positive curvature stress in lipid bilayers due to the conical shape of CLP molecules (Horn et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2018). The induction of positive curvature stress by CLPs might increase the energetic costs of the formation of negatively curved structures, especially fusion intermediates such as stalks. To test this possibility, we examined the lamellar-to-inverted hexagonal (L\u03b1/HII) phase transition of POPE using DSmC. In the absence of CLPs, the low-enthalpy L\u03b1/HII transition of POPE occurred at approximately 70\u00a0\u00b0C (Fig. 6\na, control). Caspofungin, aculeacin A, anidulafungin, and fengycin at a lipid:CLP molar ratio of 25:1 increased the transition temperature by 7.3, 9.8, 12.1, and 13.4\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 6a, Table 3). Iturin A and surfactin at molar ratios of 20:1 and 33:1 are known to increase the transition temperature of dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DEPE) by 2.0 and 1.3\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively (Yuan et al., 2018; Grau et al., 2000) (Table 3). Moreover, daptomycin and polymyxin B at a lipid:CLP molar ratio of 25:1 were found to slightly increase and diminish the T\nHII of POPE by 1.8 and 1.6\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively (Table 3). A significant increase in the L\u03b1/HII transition temperature in the presence of caspofungin, aculeacin A, anidulafungin, and fengycin indicated that the CLPs suppressed the formation of lipid structures with high negative curvature, and this ability of CLPs correlated with their inhibitory effect on the membrane fusion (Fig. 3b). Fig. 6b shows a schematic representation of the inhibition of the L\u03b1/HII transition of membrane-f",
