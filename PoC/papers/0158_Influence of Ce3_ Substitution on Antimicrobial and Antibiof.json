  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nSpinel ferrite is a class of magnetic materials that derives its name from its similarity to the naturally occurring mineral. Spinel ferrites have possible application in areas such as water treatment, data storage, the segregation of biomolecules, colour imaging, therapeutic diagnosis, antimicrobial activities, cores of transformers, bubble devices, electronic communication devices, sensors, and drug delivery [1,2,3,4]. Structure studies of spinels showed that the size of the cations in a sample plays a vital role in determining their site occupancy preferences. The presence of larger ions shifts the oxygen ions diagonally and expands the lattice parameter. The distribution of cations over the sub-lattices has a significant effect on both the chemical and physical properties of the spinel structure and subsequently affects their applications and performance [5,6]. Manipulation of the physical properties of Co-Zn spinel ferrite nanoparticles (NPs) by the incorporation of larger ions into their structure has attracted the attention of researchers. For example, Pawar et al. [7] have addressed the changes induced in the optical properties of cobalt\u2013zinc ferrite Co0.7Zn0.3HoxFe2\u2212xO4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1) due to the insertion of (Ho3+), using a facile sol\u2013gel method. These researchers found that the energy bandgap rose from 1.72 to 1.84 eV when the x increased from 0.0 to 0.1. Panda et al. [8] have described the consequences of the incorporation of chromium (Cr3+ ( ions into the system CoFe2\u2212xCrxO4 (X = 0, 0.15, 0.3). They found that the coercivity was lowered upon the insertion of Cr3+ due to the magnetic coupling with a weaker magnetic moment of Cr3+ (3\u00b5B). Farid et al. [9] substituted praseodymium (Pr3+) instead of Fe3+ into the system Co0.6Zn0.4PrxFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10). They found that the insertion of Pr3+ increased the lattice constant due to the large difference between the ionic radii of Pr3+ and Fe3+. The resistivity and activation energy also increased with the Pr3+ substitution. In our previous work, we synthesised Co-Zn spinel ferrites (ZCFO) NPs via a sol\u2013gel method. The ZCFO sample showed a low crystallite size (11.7872 nm) and high surface area (106.63 m2.g), which made it suitable for environmental applications. ZCFO NPs have been used as antimicrobial agents [10], biosensors [11], and as a promising catalyst [12].\nColon cancer is the third most common cancer globally and is the second most common cause of cancer mortality after lung cancer. Approximately 5% of colon cancer patients have an additional primary cancer. In comparison, breast cancer is the single most common cancer of women worldwide, is responsible for 30% of all cancer diagnoses in women, and has a mortality rate of approximately 14% in women. About 3% of breast cancer patients have an additional primary cancer. Breast cancer susceptibility genes have been found to increase the susceptibility to colon cancer of patients with breast cancer [13].\nThe tumour microenvironment (TME) is a complex network composed of multipotent cells such as stromal cells, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, endothelial cell precursors and immune cells, and secreted mediators such as cytokines, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are related to the initiation and maintenance of tumorigenesis. Oncogenic pathways can be associated with major changes in the TME to induce proliferation and inhibit apoptosis and promote angiogenesis and avoid hypoxia as well as inhibit the immune detection and activate immune cells to support invasion and metastasis [14]. Hence, cancer manipulation targeting the components of the TME including metabolites, ROS, hypoxia, and cytokine-mediated inflammation could be a valuable approach to cancer therapy. In radio-therapeutic oncology, radiation directly and indirectly, via radiolysis, induces damage to the structure of DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to injury of the organelles and cell membranes of cancer cells. Irradiation also disrupts the immunogenicity and microenvironment of cancer cells. These factors have a vital role in regulating cancer cell mitosis, apoptosis, necrosis, proliferation, and other biological functions [15]. Radiotherapy is considered to be an effective treatment option after surgery. However, colorectal cancer exhibits resistance to ionising radiation (IR) as used in radiation oncology treatment. The high doses of radiation required to be delivered to a tumour also result in damage to adjacent normal tissues or organs [16]. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and has a poor prognosis. Radiotherapy plays an important role in treating TNBC [17]. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of drugs that serve as radiosensitisers to overcome the radioresistance exhibited by various cancers, including colorectal and TNBC [16,18].\nIn the current study, we supplemented radiotherapy with theranostic nanoparticles constructed using several approaches such as by conjugating therapeutic agents to imaging nanoparticles, then imaging agents to therapeutic nanoparticles, and hence engineering unique nanoparticles possessing both therapeutic and diagnostic abilities [19]. Ebselen (Eb) (N-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one) is one of the organo-selenium compounds that mimics glutathione peroxidase and exhibits a wide range of biological activities including antibacterial, cyto-protective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities [20]. In biomedical applications, nanoparticles have attracted attention due to their physiochemical properties such as appropriate size, large surface-to-mass ratios, high reactivity, and the ability to modify the biological influence of diffusivity and immunogenicity [21]. The rare earth element cerium (Ce), which has the electronic configuration [Xe] 4 f26s2, has valuable properties due to its possession of shielded 4f electrons. Ce can exist in two common oxidation states, Ce3+ and Ce4+ [22]. In biology, cerium oxide nanoparticles (Ce-NPs) have attracted particular interest because of their regenerative and multi-enzymatic scavenging of ROS. The unique antioxidant/catalytic properties of Ce-NPs stem from their reversible switching between the oxidation states of Ce3+ and Ce4+ and their low reduction potential of around 1.52 V23. The bulk of crystals of cerium dioxide consists of Ce4+, but the nano-dimensions reduce the size to Ce3+, resulting in a higher activity of biological antioxidant processes [19,22]. We synthesised the ZnFeO4 (ZFO) system using the sol\u2013gel method. Ce3+ ions were then inserted into the pristine sample using Fe3+ ions with different concentrations: ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.0\u20130.8; step = 0.02). We then investigated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against some pathogenic microbes with the possible reaction mechanism determination (SEM imaging, and protein leakage assay) as well as anticancer effects of Eb and ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 nanoparticles (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08) conjugated with Eb on human breast and colorectal cancer cell lines, evaluating their levels of ROS, inflammatory milieu, and related signalling effectors as well as investigating their effects on autophagy, cell cycle, and apoptosis.\n\n## 2.1. Structural Studies\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) NPs are presented in Figure 1. The diffraction peaks observed correspond to those of spinel ferrites, belonging to the Fd3 m space group (JCPDS card nos. 88-1935, and 74-2082) [23,24]. The crystallite size (D) ranged between 7.75 and 11.63 nm, and the lattice constant, aexp, was in the range 8.34\u20138.44 nm, as obtained in our previous work [25]. The change in aexp and D is attributed to the replacement of the smaller ionic crystal radius of Fe3+ (0.064 nm) by the larger Ce3+ (0.103 nm) ions [26,27,28,29].\nFigure 2 shows the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) samples. For the ZFO spinel ferrite sample used in this work, there were two peaks, \u03c51 = 551.06 cm\u22121 and \u03c52 = 433.67 cm\u22121. These peaks are fundamental and confirm the successful formation of the cubic spinel phase in the ZFO sample [30,31,32]. The positions of the vibrational bands are listed in Table 1. In general, spinel ferrites show two essential vibrational bands, \u03c51 and \u03c52, which correspond to the stretching vibration of tetrahedral groups (A-site) and the stretching vibration of octahedral groups (B-site) [25]. From Figure 2, it is clear that the insertion of Ce3+ ions into the structure of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 shifted the bands of the tetrahedral and octahedral sites toward the lower-frequency side. The substitution of Ce3+ ions into the B-site resulted in the migration of an equal number of Fe3+ and Zn ions from A sites to B sites to ease the strain [26]. The ionic radii of the B sites increased due to the settlement of the Ce3+ ions. This augmentation in the ionic radii of the A and B sites reduced the fundamental frequency [26,33]. The peaks with a wave number of 2354 cm\u22121 were attributed to the presence of carbonyl groups, while the peak at around 2926 cm\u22121 was ascribed to O-H stretching [10,11,12,25,34,35].\nThe scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) NPs are shown in Figure 3a\u2013e. The surface behaviour reveals an inhomogeneous grain appearance, in which the smooth agglomerates can be observed due to the occupation of a large quantity of Ce3+ ions at the grain boundary that could control the grain growth [36]. The surface was markedly porous and presented a coalescing form of the agglomerated particles connected with the interfacial surface tension phenomena [25]. The composition of the ZnCe0.8Fe1.92O4 sample was analysed using energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) (Figure 3f), and the presence of Ce, Zn, O, C, and Fe was confirmed [11,12].\nTo further illustrate the structural features of the samples, mapping of elements to the ZnCe0.8Fe1.92O4 sample was carried out (Figure 4). It is evident from these images that the elements Zn, Fe, Ce, C, S, and O exist, an observation that agreed with the preceding EDX results. These elements were homogeneously distributed.\nThe Zeta potential of the synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) NPs was examined at the culture media as used in the treatments to determine the surface charge of the synthesised samples, which in turn determine the stability, as observed in Figure 5. From the present results, it is notable that the Zeta potential of the ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) NPs surface maintains a negative statement at pH 7 (cultural media pH). The initial Zeta potential of ZnFe2O4 NPs was \u221238.2 mV (Figure 5a), which completely agrees with the previous results obtained [37,38]. After the substitution of Ce3+ on ZnFe2O4 NPs (at different concentrations), the potential of substituent samples was slightly changed to be \u221237.7, \u221236.5, \u221230.5, and \u221230.2 mV when X = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08, respectively, due to the positive charge of Ce3+ and the net charge still negative at neutral medium (pH 7), as shown in Figure 5b,c,d,e, respectively. The magnitude of the zeta potential is predictive of the colloidal stability [39]. Nanoparticles with Zeta potential values from \u00b130 to \u00b140 have moderate stability [40], as shown in our synthesised samples. Dispersions with a low zeta potential value will eventually aggregate due to the Van Der Waal inter-particle attractions [41].\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis was performed to evaluate particle size distribution and to calculate the average particle size of the synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) NPs that was found as 36.71 nm when X = 0. Additionally, the particle size was found to be 43.20, 45.91, 49.27, and 54.87 nm when X = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08, respectively, in the synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 NPs, as shown in Figure 6.\nIt is important to state that the grown moderate mono-size distributed ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) NPs were attributed to the synthesis method, and the particle size distribution was sharply increased as Ce3+ ions content increased in the prepared sample. It is common that DLS size measurements become higher than the crystallite size (D) measurements (Figure 1), as DLS analysis is estimating the hydrodynamic radius of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 (X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) NPs bounded by water molecules, resulting in larger particle sizes of the capped NPs, while XRD analysis is calculating the crystallite size of the powder material without water layer [42].\nThe polydispersity index (PDI) can be obtained from instruments that use DLS or are determined from electron micrographs. International standards organisations (ISOs) have established that PDI values < 0.05 are more common to monodisperse samples, while values > 0.7 are common to a broad size (e.g., polydisperse) distribution of particles [43]. Herein, for the obtained PDI values (Figure 6), we found that the PDI value increases as Ce3+ ions content increases in the prepared sample and was found to be 0.304, 0.395, 0.399, and 0.539 in ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 NPs when X = 0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, respectively. The present values indicate that the synthesised samples were moderate mono-size distributed.\n\n## 2.2. Antimicrobial Potential\nAntimicrobial agents have been used to treat and control the microbial infection [44]. The use of novel nanomaterial-based agents for the limitation of pathogenic microbes has received attention from several researchers [10]. In our study, the as-synthesised ferrite samples were checked for their antimicrobial activity using the agar-disc diffusion technique. The results indicated that the ferrite specimens reduced the activity of a wide range of bacteria including P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, and S. aureus. ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 had the most powerful antimicrobial effects against all the microbes examined. The power of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 as antimicrobial agent declines in the following order: C. albicans (13.5 \u00b1 0.5000 mm), \u02c3S. aureus (13.2 \u00b1 0.2335 mm), \u02c3P.\naeruginosa (9.5 \u00b1 0.5000 mm), \u02c3P. mirabilis (9.5 \u00b1 1.0000 mm), \u02c3P. vulgaris (9.0 \u00b1 0.2335 mm), \u02c3S. typhi (9.0 \u00b1 0.6545 mm), \u02c3C. tropicalis (8.9 \u00b1 0.6545 mm), \u02c3E. coli (8.5 \u00b1 0.6545 mm), and \u02c3K. pneumoniae (8.0 \u00b1 0.5755 mm) (Table 2).\nThe antimicrobial activity of the synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 increased as the X value increased (Figure 7a). The highest zone of inhibition (ZOI) of S. aureus was observed when X = 0.06 in ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 and slightly decreased when X = 0.08. In the case of C. albicans, the active sample was ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 with X =0.06 (Figure 7b).\nThe antimicrobial abilities of the as-synthesised samples were compared with the standard antibacterial amoxicillin (AX; 25.0 \u03bcg/mL) and the antifungal agent nystatin (NS; 25.0 \u03bcg/mL) as a positive control. Our samples were more active than the standard antibiotics, and the microbes tested were resistant to the standard antibiotics. The synthesized ferrites samples (5.0 \u00b5L; 1.0 \u00b5g/mL) were placed over 6.0 mm applied disks.\nNext, nanoparticles were compared with the precursors used in the synthetic process, Eb alone and the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) organic solvent (as a negative control), and not all were active against the microbes tested (Figure 7a,b).\nThe synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 was more active against Gram-positive bacteria than against Gram-negative bacteria because the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria contains a thick layer of lipopolysaccharides in addition to a small layer of peptidoglycans, whereas Gram-positive bacteria have a thicker layer of peptidoglycans [45]. In general, inorganic NPs have high surface-to-volume ratios and nanoscale sizes. Consequently, they can combine and interact with some pathogenic microbes such as yeasts, bacteria, and fungi [46]. The unique properties of the inorganic NPs make them potentially valuable in a wide range of biomedical applications. With the decreases in the effectiveness of traditional antibiotics due to the increases in drug resistance in some bacteria, NPs may be valuable as medications [47].\nThe results of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) tests (ranged from 0.195 to 12.50 \u03bcg/mL) of the samples against all microbes were tested. The MIC of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 was 0.390 \u03bcg/mL against S. aureus. The synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 had an MIC of 0.195 \u03bcg/mL against C. albicans, suggesting that it could be used as an antifungal agent at low concentration, which means that the minimum concentration of our synthesised sample gave antimicrobial activity that was less than 0.5 part per million (ppm), which is a good and promising result, especially as they will not have any toxicity when applied in the in vivo studies.\nThe properties of the synthesised ferrites play a vital role in their antimicrobial characteristics: their elemental structure, purity, and size of the synthesised ferrites must be analysed to explain their antimicrobial activity [48]. The composition of the ferrites, their particle size, and the doping with Ce played an important part in improving the antimicrobial efficacy of the ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 at very low concentrations (10.0 \u00b5g/mL) against all tested bacteria and yeasts. They possess encouraging physical and chemical behaviour, more than those of the usual organic and synthetic antimicrobial agents, such as a unique link to pathogens, leading to more interaction with pathogenic bacteria and yeasts and therefore increasing their antimicrobial potential [49]. The mechanisms of action were enhanced by the ability of the NPs to modify the distribution of ROS such as the superoxide anion O2\u2212 [50], the infiltration of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 within the pathogenic microbes, and an alkaline tendency [51]. ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 might be able to alter the microbial morphology and the composition of the biofilms, change the microbial membrane permeability, and induce expression of the oxidative stress genes [52].\n\n## 2.3. Antibiofilm Activity of ZnCe\nThe production of biofilms by pathogenic microbes is characterised by the secretion of exo-polysaccharides [53]. The test tube method was applied to determine the antibiofilm potential of the synthesised ferrites against some familiar pathogenic microbes.\nFigure 8 shows the antibiofilm action of the as-synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 against S. aureus and C. albicans. The complete steps were (I): normal microbial growth and production of a distinct ring in the absence of the synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 and interference with microbial growth in the vicinity of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06, (II): staining of the biofilm with crystal violet (CV), which produced qualitative results, and (III): elimination and separation of the adhered microbial cells after the addition of ethanol for the semi-quantitative measurement of the extent of biofilm hindrance (Table 3).\nFigure 8a displays the start of the tube design for the determination of the antibiofilm potential of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 against S. aureus. This bacterium produced a thick whitish-yellow layer at the air\u2013liquid interface in the ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 control. The matte layers produced were fully adhered across the walls of the tubes and developed a blue colour following staining with CV. A dark blue colour was created in the solution subsequent to dissolving CV with absolute ethanol (Figure 8a).\nThe managed tubes that included S. aureus cells and 10.0 \u00b5g/mL ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 showed a marked negative effect on biofilm and ring formation. The colour of the adherent cells was muted, and the blue colour was faint after the addition of ethanol (Figure 8a). Similar results were observed for the repression of biofilms of the yeast C. albicans (Figure 8b).\nThe semi-quantitative determination of the inhibition percentage was performed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 570.0 nm. The optical density (O.D) was estimated following the elimination of CV-stained biofilms.\nTable 3 discerns the percentage of inhibition. The highest percentage was observed for S. aureus (92.73%), P. mirabilis (79.54%), and C. albicans (90.18%) following the addition of 10.0 \u00b5g/mL ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06.\nZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 controlled the growth of biofilm at a constant degree of adhesion, the first step in the antimicrobial behaviour [54]. The difference in the inhibitory percentage may be produced by many factors, such as the potential of the antimicrobial agents, the attraction on the surface because of the large surface area of the ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06, physical features such asZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 particle sizes, invasion skills, and different chemical characteristics influencing the relationship and communication of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 with biofilm-producing microbes. ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 repressed the growth of S. aureus by more than 98% at 0.390 \u00b5g/mL, as mentioned in the MIC results. By arresting exo-polysaccharide synthesis, which is a precursor to biofilm formation, the creation of S. aureus biofilm was then prevented [53].\n\n## 2.4. Reaction Mechanism Determination Using SEM Analysis\nTo explain the antimicrobial behaviour of the synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06, we tried to define the mechanism of action toward S.\naureus after the SEM analysis. The SEM analysis showed the appearance of the bacterial cells (S.\naureus) following ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 treatment of the control sample. In the control sample, bacterial groups were constantly developed and displayed typical cellular forms, including the normal bacterial surface and semi-formed biofilm (Figure 9a).\nAfter treatment with ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06, morphological differences in S.\naureus were apparent (Figure 9b). We also observed the complete lysis of bacterial cells with a concomitant decrease in the viable number, and ultimately the growth of biofilm was inhibited (Figure 9b). These results reflected the antimicrobial activity of Ce addition in the synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 and confirmed the ZOI results (Table 2).\n\n## 2.5. Determination of Protein Leakage from Bacterial Cell Membranes\nThe quantities of protein discharged in the suspension of the treated S. aureus cells were determined applying the Bradford method [55]. As shown in Figure 10, it is obvious that the quantity of cellular protein discharged from S. aureus is directly proportional to the concentration of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 nanocomposite and was found to be 79.05 \u00b5g/mL after the treatment with 1.0 mg/mL of the tested ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 nanocomposite, which proves the antibacterial characteristics of the synthesised nanocomposites and explains the creation of holes and destruction in the cell membrane of S. aureus, causing the oozing out of the proteins from the S. aureus cytoplasm. On the other hand, the synthesised ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0 nanocomposite exhibited reduced activity in membrane leakage after measured cellular protein release from S. aureus and was found to be 18.95 \u00b5g/mL.\nThese results revealed that ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 nanocomposite; where X = 0.06 showed an improvement in the permeability of S. aureus cell membranes more than ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; where X = 0 nanocomposite. Therefore, it could be assumed that confusion of membranous permeability would be a vital portion of the repression of bacterial mass. Related studies [56] and [57] described comparable outcomes when ferrites were incorporated, which revealed concentration-dependent destabilisation in the cell membrane of bacterial cells and pointed to leakage of their intracellular substance into the extracellular form (bacterial cell suspension).\nPaul et al. [58] proved that the difference in bacterial cell membrane permeability was shown in percentage difference in corresponding electric conductivity. It was reported that the percentage of relative electric conductivities of all tested samples improves with the rise in the concentration of the treated nanocomposites. The integrity of the bacterial cell membrane is defined by analysing the discharge of bacterial cell components such as proteins; the leakage developed with time, as there was constant cell membrane injury that pointed to the leakage of cell components deriving from the cell destruction, which confirms the results obtained in SEM analysis (Figure 9).\nEl-Batal et al. [59] have shown that there are four mechanisms that produce the effects of metal NPs on microbial cells. After comparison with our study, we recognise that ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06 start their activity by adhesion at the outer surface of the microbial cell, allowing membrane damage, formation of pits (as mentioned in membrane leakage assay), and switching off of the ions\u2019 transport activity (Figure 11).\nThe nano-metals then modify the ionic structure (Ce3+) inside the bacterial cell at pH 3 and interfere with the intracellular structures such as plasmids, DNA, and other vital organelles. Cellular toxicity occurs due to the oxidative stress generated by the production of ROS (Figure 11). ZnFe2O4 NPs could withstand the acidic conditions inside the bacterial cells, and the conversion described above did not occur [60], but the antibacterial effect was caused by the presence of nano-structures inside the bacterial cells, which, in turn, affected signal transduction pathways. There were significant reaction mechanisms such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) division (superoxide anion; O2\u2212) [59], and it is suggested that ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4; X = 0.06, could alter the microbial morphology, diminish the microbial membrane permeability, and induce the abundance of oxidative stress genes as a compensatory response due to the H2O2 production [49,59].\n\n## 2.6.1. Screening of the Cytotoxic Profile of Different Concentrations of Eb and ZnCe\nThe cytotoxicity screening found the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Eb to be 57.28 \u00b5g/mL on MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 12I(a)) and 60 \u00b5g/mL on HT-29 cells (Figure 12II(a)). The optimal cytotoxic concentration of ZnCexFe2\u2212xO4 nanoparticles at different concentrations of (X) on MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 cell lines were 100 \u00b5M/L for ZnFe2O4 (Figure 12I(b)) and 100 \u00b5M/L for ZnCe0.06 Fe1.94 O4 (Figure 12II(b)), respectively. Magnetic nanoparticles have valuable properties as theranostics, including hyperthermia and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and can be used in biosensors and drug delivery platforms [61,62]. Saquib et al. [63] reported that ZnFe2O4 NPs possess antitumour potential via the induction of apoptosis and necrosis in human amnion epithelial (WISH) cells, through the mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway. It has also been found that ZnFe2O4 NPs cause genomic instability in the meristematic root cells of sunflowers, through induced chromosomal aberrations [64], supporting the contention that ZnFe2O4 NPs are cytotoxic. Several studies have found Ce oxide to have a unique electronic configuration, providing anti-inflammatory, non-invasive, and oxidative stress features. These characteristics result in the production of ROS at the microvascular stage level, owing to their natural reduction and oxidation reactions in the cells [65,66]. ROS generation relies on the production of defects caused by oxygen vacancies in the crystal structure of the nanoparticles, which could be boosted by selective metal ion doping of the lattice structure [67]. Apart from the stabilised dissolution of Zn from the ZnFe2O4 lattice owing to Fe doping, which contributes to the tumour cell growth inhibition, CeO2 doping with metals resulted in an increased photocatalytic activity, due to a better separation of h+/e- pairs [68] owing to the electron accepting capability and/or hole donors, and facilitates charge carrier localisation [69]. In turn, these migrated holes contribute to the production of \u00b7OH radicals when reacted with chemisorbed H2O molecules and form the free radicals \u00b7OH and O2., which are the primary cause of cell death and the oxidation of organic matter such as bacterial cell walls and membranes [70]. This phenomenon might explain the potentiated cytotoxic activity of ZnFe2O4 lattice after CeO2 doping observed in the current data. Furthermore, the antitumour efficacy of Eb, an organo-selenium compound, is attributed to its ability to induce apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, upregulate caspases and DNA fragmentation, cause cell-cycle arrest, and reduce oxidative stress in many cancers [71,72]. The IC50 of Eb was taken into account when determining the optimal concentration of ZnFe2O4 nanocarrier, which was then incorporated into the optimal concentration of ZnFe2O4, afterwards applied to MDA-MB-231 cells, and the IC50 was found to be 25.7 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 12I(c)). In HT-29 cells, the previously determined IC50 of Eb was incorporated into the optimal cytotoxic concentration in the ZnCe0.06Fe1.94O4 nanocarrier, and the IC50 was found to be 15.29 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 12II(c)). The incorporation of Eb to ZnCexFe2-xO4 nanocomposite enhanced the cytotoxic effect against cancers cell lines, as shown in our study. However, incubation of normal Vero renal epithelial cells with Eb-ZnFe2O4 and Eb-ZnCe0.06Fe1.94O4 at concentrations ranging from 1\u2013100 \u00b5M over 24 h showed no cytotoxicity or morphological changes (Figure 12III) versus MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 cells, which revealed a notable greater susceptibility against both NPs at corresponding concentrations. The morphological alterations represented reduced cell viability and population, detachment, rounding, and shrinkage, suggesting the incidence of apoptosis (as shown in Figure S1-I, II, and III). Accordingly, these data suggest the selective toxicity against MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 cells.\n\n## MDA-MB-231 Cell Line\nThe effect of Eb-ZFO on ROS status including hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione(GSH) levels as ",
