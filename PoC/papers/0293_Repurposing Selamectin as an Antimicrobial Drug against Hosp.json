  "abstract": "The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains requires the urgent discovery of new antibacterial drugs. In this context, an antibacterial screening of a subset of anthelmintic avermectins against gram-positive and gram-negative strains was performed. Selamectin completely inhibited bacterial growth at 6.3 \u03bcg/mL concentrations against reference gram-positive strains, while no antibacterial activity was found against gram-negative strains up to the highest concentration tested of 50 \u03bcg/mL. Given its relevance as a community and hospital pathogen, further studies have been performed on selamectin activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), using clinical isolates with different antibiotic resistance profiles and a reference biofilm-producing strain. Antibacterial studies have been extensive on clinical S. aureus isolates with different antibiotic resistance profiles. Mean MIC90 values of 6.2 \u03bcg/mL were reported for all tested S. aureus strains, except for the macrolide-resistant isolate with constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance phenotype (MIC90 9.9 \u03bcg/mL). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed that selamectin exposure caused relevant cell surface alterations. A synergistic effect was observed between ampicillin and selamectin, dictated by an FIC value of 0.5 against methicillin-resistant strain. Drug administration at MIC concentration reduced the intracellular bacterial load by 81.3%. The effect on preformed biofilm was investigated via crystal violet and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Selamectin reduced the biofilm biomass in a dose-dependent manner with minimal biofilm eradication concentrations inducing a 50% eradication (MBEC50) at 5.89 \u03bcg/mL. The cytotoxic tests indicated that selamectin exhibited no relevant hemolytic and cytotoxic activity at active concentrations. These data suggest that selamectin may represent a timely and promising macrocyclic lactone for the treatment of S. aureus infections.",

  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nThe emergence of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) represents a serious and continual threat to public health in both developed and developing nations [1]. These infections have garnered a pervasive global presence, yielding direct and indirect socio-economic repercussions [2]. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a distressing 10 out of every 100 patients fall victim to HAIs, leading to fatal outcomes in a striking 87.1% of cases [3]. Furthermore, recent estimates by the CDC indicate annual healthcare costs ranging from 28 to 45 billion dollars in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) has underscored the presence of 12 bacterial families, grouped into three distinct categories based on the exigency for novel antibiotics (critical, high, and medium priority). Among those deemed high priority is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [4]. This bacterial strain stands as the primary etiology of the lower respiratory tract and surgical site infections, emerging as the second leading source of bacteremia, cardiovascular infections, and infections stemming from indwelling medical devices, both within the community and notably within the hospital environment [5]. Although current antibiotic regimens, including vancomycin, daptomycin, and linezolid, target MRSA, resistance to these drugs is swiftly emerging [6]. Beyond its antibiotic resistance, addressing MRSA infections is further compounded by its propensity to establish biofilms on both biotic and abiotic surfaces, alongside its ability to subsist within host cells [7]. These growth modalities can substantially undermine the efficacy of host defenses and antibiotic therapies [8]. Annually, nearly 25,000 patients within Europe continue to succumb to severe infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with a notable proportion attributed to MRSA. Consequently, the imperative to search for innovative therapeutic antimicrobial strategies capable of countering both antibiotic-resistant and persistent MRSA strains is underscored. Current paradigms of antimicrobial drug discovery encompass various stages, including microbiological in vitro antibacterial assays, structure-activity relationship studies, and eventual in vivo experimental assessments to ascertain toxicity and performance [9]. However, this protracted and financially demanding process (with costs reaching up to ~$800 million and spanning 15\u201320 years) coupled with the swift emergence of antimicrobial resistance has led to waning interest in the pursuit of new antibiotics [3,10]. In response, renewed attention has focused on repurposing pre-existing drugs that have previously received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as antibiotics. Indeed, drug repurposing offers a novel and potent avenue for drug development, capitalizing on extant knowledge of their pharmacology, toxicity, and formulation [11]. Drug repurposing affords several advantages over conventional methods, encompassing marked reductions in research and development costs, expedited FDA approval timelines, and potential market exclusivity [12]. Numerous evidence has documented the antibacterial efficacy of various anthelmintic drugs against a spectrum of pathogens, including strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Clostridium difficile and others [13]. Anthelmintics constitute a category of anti-parasitic agents primarily designated for worm infections [14]. Within this category, the avermectins assume prominence, featuring 16 macrocyclic lactone derivatives produced through Streptomyces avermitilis fermentation [15]. While structurally akin to antibacterial macrolides and antifungal macrocyclic polygenes, the avermectins diverge in terms of their mechanism of action. These derivatives are classified into four major (A1a, A2a, B1a, and B2a) and minor (A1b, A2b, B1b, and B2b) classes. Notable members encompass ivermectin, abamectin, nemadectin, doramectin, milbemycin, eprinomectin, moxidectin, and selamectin. The molecular structures of select avermectins are depicted in Figure 1. Limited evidence exists concerning the antibacterial potential of doramectin, moxidectin, and selamectin [16]. These molecules interact with gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) receptors and glutamate-dependent chloride channels within the nervous systems of parasites. As these channels are indispensable for parasite survival, their disruption leads to compromised neurotransmission, culminating in paralysis and invertebrate demise [17]. The rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens poses a pressing threat to public health, challenging healthcare workers with a dwindling arsenal of effective antibiotics. This has led to the emergence of complex infections that prove difficult to handle. Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) have shown particularly serious implications. In response to this growing crisis, there is a compelling need to expedite the advancement of novel antibiotics. However, it is crucial to recognize that this research is both financially demanding and time-consuming. In this context, the main objective of this study was to examine the antibacterial potentials of three commercially available non-antibiotic drugs against S. aureus infections. This effort seeks to establish an alternative avenue for addressing S. aureus infections through a rapid and cost-effective drug discovery strategy. The latter, combined with catalytic environmental corrections, would significantly limit the spread of mutant-resistant bacteria and the risk of looming in complex infections.\n\n## 2.1. Compound\nDoramectin, moxidectin, and selamectin were bought by Sigma-Aldrich (Burlington, MA, USA). The compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.\n\n## 2.2. Characterization of the Bacterial Strains\nReference strains of S. aureus (ATCC 6538), Corynebacterium striatum (C. striatum, ATCC BAA-1293), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis, ATCC 12228), E. coli (ATCC 11229), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae, ATCC 10031), and P. aeruginosa (ATCC 9027) were used for initial screening of the selected avermectins. Reference strains were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Further exploration of the antibacterial efficacy of selamectin encompassed clinical isolates of S. aureus (CI1\u20135) characterized by diverse antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. These clinical isolates were derived from a range of sources (blood, sputum, wound, and eye) and were part of an anonymous collection established at the Microbiology Laboratory of Luigi Vanvitelli University Hospital in Naples, Italy. For the assessment of selamectin\u2019s anti-biofilm activity, S. aureus reference strain ATCC 1167 was employed (Table 1). Samples were plated on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood and Chapman\u2019s medium (bioMerieux, Marcy-l\u2019Etoile, France) and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C (Biocompare, 311DS incubator, South San Francisc, CA, USA). The identification of bacterial strains and susceptibility testing were executed through Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight MS (MALDI-TOF) MS (Microflex LRF, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA) and the Phoenix BD system (M50 instrument, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) [18,19].\n\n## 2.3. Bacterial Growth Conditions\nBacterial strains were grown in Mueller Hinton (MH) (non-biofilm forming C. striatum, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and clinical isolates CI1\u20135) and Luria Bertani (LB) (biofilm forming S. aureus ATCC 1167) media (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, MA, USA) at 37 \u00b0C in aerobic conditions. To obtain a bacterial suspension suitable for antibacterial assays, fresh colonies of each strain, grown on MH and LB agar, were inoculated in MH and LB media, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The bacterial suspension was resuspended in a fresh medium and further incubated at 37 \u00b0C until bacterial growth reached the exponential phase. Serial dilutions were performed to achieve the necessary bacterial load for the tests (1 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL).\n\n## 2.4. Cell Culture Conditions\nThe immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) were employed for cytotoxicity assays and bacterial invasion tests. They were grown in high glucose DMEM medium (Gibco Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, UK), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco Life Technologies, Scotland, UK) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco Life Technologies, Scotland, UK). The cells were maintained at a temperature of 37 \u00b0C, with a CO2 concentration of 5% in a humid environment using a ThermoFisher Forma Series II Water-Jacketed CO2 Incubator (Waltham, MA, USA).\n\n## 2.5. Antibacterial Susceptibility Assays\nThe antibacterial activity assays were conducted using the broth microdilution method, according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Assays were conducted in 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for a final test volume of 100 \u03bcL. Doramectin, moxidectin, and selamectin were selected and tested on S. aureus ATCC 6538. For each compound, dilutions in the concentration range of 50 to 0.4 \u03bcg/mL were prepared. A 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL bacterial inoculum was incubated with the test compounds at 37 \u00b0C for 20 h under aerobic conditions. Vancomycin and meropenem (Burlington, MA, USA) were employed as positive controls (CTR+) for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively, while untreated bacteria were considered as the negative control (CTR-). The turbidity was measured via a microplate reader (Tecan life science, Seestrasse, Switzerland). The rate of growth inhibition was determined using the following formula [20]:%\u00a0Growth\u00a0inhibition=100\u2212100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Abs\u00a0600\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0test\u00a0sampleAbs\u00a0600\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0CTR\u2212\nSubsequently, the antibacterial potential of active drugs was investigated more thoroughly on S. aureus.\n\n## 2.6. Cell Cytotoxicity Test\nThe cytotoxicity assays were performed using the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) method. HaCaT cells were seeded into a 96-well flat-bottom plate at a density of 2 \u00d7 104 cells per well. This plate was subsequently incubated for 20 h under conditions of 37 \u00b0C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. Cells were treated with selamectin for 20 h at concentrations ranging from 50 to 0.4 \u03bcg/mL in a final volume of 100 \u03bcL. On the other hand, only the medium and DMSO were employed as CTR- and CTR+ controls, respectively. Later, 100 \u00b5L of the MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 3 h. Next, the medium was removed and 100 \u00b5L of DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The amount of formazan crystal was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a multiplate reader. The data were presented as a percentage of cell viability relative to the positive control. The levels of viability were calculated using the subsequent formula [21]:%\u00a0Cytotoxicity=100\u2212Abs\u00a0570\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0test\u00a0sample\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100Abs\u00a0570\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0CTR\u2212\n\n## 2.7. Hemolysis Assays\nSelamectin was tested on human erythrocytes of blood group 0 obtained from a healthy patient. The blood was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for five minutes (Microfuge 16, Beckman coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and the erythrocytes were washed 5 times with a solution (TBS) containing 50 Mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 0.15 M NaCl. After the washes, the erythrocytes were diluted 10-fold using the TBS solution. A volume of 50 \u00b5L of drug at the concentrations mentioned above (50 to 0.4 \u03bcg/mL) was added to 50 \u00b5L of cell suspension and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Two controls were included in the assay, which were dissolved drug solvent and 0.1% Triton X-100, used as CTR- and CTR+, respectively. After incubation, the plate was centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min and 50 \u03bcL of supernatant from each well was transferred to a new 96-well plate (Microfuge 16, Beckman coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The supernatants were used to measure the absorbance of the released hemoglobin at 540 nm. The hemolysis percentage of each sample was calculated using the following formula:%\u00a0Hemolysis=Abs\u00a0540\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0test\u00a0sample\u2212\u00a0Abs\u00a0540\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0CTR\u2212(Abs\u00a0540\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0CTR+\u2212Abs\u00a0540\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0CTR\u2212\u00d7100\n\n## 2.8. Killing Kinetic Assays\nThe antibacterial potential of selamectin was further evaluated through time-killing curve analysis. Dilutions in the concentration range of 3.1\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL were assembled for a final volume of 2 mL/tube. Untreated bacteria and vancomycin were regarded as CTR- and CTR+, respectively. A bacterial inoculum of 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL was added to each tube and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 h. Volumes of 100 \u00b5L were extracted from the bacterial suspensions and subjected to serial dilution within MH broth. The dilutions were plated on MH agar and the plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. The resulting colonies were counted, and the CFU/mL values were determined.\n\n## 2.9. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\nMorphological changes in response to exposure to selamectin were evaluated by SEM. Bacterial samples treated with the drug solvent or vancomycin were respectively designated as CTR- and CTR+. The bacterial suspensions were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and dehydrated in 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%, and 100% ethanol. Afterwards, the bacteria were deposited on a glass support and coated with a thin layer of Au-Pd (Sputter Coater Denton Vacuum Desk V, Moorestown, NJ, USA). Morphological properties of bacterial cells were marked using an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV with Everhart Thornley Detector (ETD) and Through Lens Detector (TLD) at 10,000, 25,000, and 35,000\u00d7 magnification.\n\n## 2.10. Checkerboard Tests\nCheckerboard assays were conducted to assess the synergistic effects of selamectin (A) and ampicillin (Burlington, MA, USA) (B). Double serial dilutions of the antibiotic and selamectin were assembled for the concentration ranges of 250\u20130.5 \u03bcg/mL and 50\u20130.4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. A 1 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL bacterial inoculum of S. aureus CI5 was added to the alone and combination compounds and the resulting plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 h. The combined inhibitory potential was quantified through the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), calculated employing the ensuing formula:FICI=MIC\u00a0A\u00a0in\u00a0combinationMIC\u00a0A\u00a0alone+MIC\u00a0B\u00a0in\u00a0combinationMIC\u00a0B\u00a0alone\nThe FICI values determine: (i) synergy, FICI \u2264 0.5; (ii) partial synergy 0.5 < FICI \u2264 1.0; (iii) no interaction 1.0 > FICI \u2264 4.0; and (iv) antagonism FICI > 4.0. The synergistic combination was further evaluated through the time-killing curve analysis. Selamectin (3.1 \u00b5g/mL) and Ampicillin (1 \u00b5g/mL) were assembled for a final volume of 2 mL/tube. Untreated bacteria, Ampicillin at the concentration of 250 and 1 \u00b5g/mL and selamectin at 6.3 and 3.1 \u00b5g/mL consisted of CTR- and CTR+. A bacterial inoculum of 2 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL was inoculated in each tube and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 20 h. Serial dilutions of the treated and untreated samples in MH broth were performed and plated on MH agar. The colonies were counted and the CFU/mL values were obtained [22].\n\n## 2.11. In Silico Molecular Docking\nThe interaction of selamectin with known macrolide target was investigated through PatchDock Beta 1.3 Version (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/php.php (accessed on 1 December 2021)) and FireDock web server (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/FireDock/php.php (accessed on 3 Dicember 2021)) software. The 23S RNA structure derived from an S. aureus wild-type and resistant to macrolides was used to conduct the docking studies. PatchDock uses the complementarity of the molecular surfaces of the target and the ligand (selamectin) to generate the best forms of interaction. This server provided a list of candidate complexes showing: (i) the number of identified interactions; (ii) geometric complementarity score (score); (iii) approximate interface area of the complex (area); (iv) atomic contact energy (ace). Later, FireDock optimized the solutions provided by the first server, allowing the movement of the target molecule into the binding site, and changing its orientation.\n\n## 2.12. Gentamicin Protection Assay\nThe HaCat cell line was used to examine the inhibition of S. aureus CI5 (MRSA strains) invasion by selamectin. Cells were seeded in a 12-well flat bottom plate at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells per well, followed by a 24-h incubation period. After 2 h of starvation, a 3 \u00d7 107 CFU/mL bacterial inoculum of S. aureus CI5 in antibiotic and serum-free DMEM was added to cell monolayers for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. Post-infection, HaCat cells were treated with DMEM supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL of gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) and incubated for 2 h to eliminate extracellular bacteria. Later, the cell monolayer underwent a double wash with 1\u00d7PBS and treatment with selamectin in the concentration range of 6.3 to 0.4 \u03bcg/mL for 0.5, 1, and 2 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. CTR+ and CTR- consisted of infected and uninfected cells with the bacterial inoculum, respectively. After the treatment, the cells were lysed with cold 0.1% TritonX (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) for 5 min. Serial dilutions of free bacteria were plated on MH agar and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The ensuing colonies were enumerated to calculate CFU/mL values. The outcomes were expressed as a percentage of the intracellular bacterial load.\n\n## 2.13. Biofilm Degradation Assay\nThe potential of selamectin to degrade preformed biofilms was evaluated through the crystal violet (CV) test. A bacterial inoculum of 2 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL in LB supplemented with 1% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) was prepared. After, 100 \u00b5L of the bacterial suspension was added to each well of a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for a period of 24 h under static conditions, promoting biofilm growth. After incubation, planktonic cells were removed by washing with 1\u00d7PBS and the mature biofilm was treated with selamectin at concentrations from 0.39 to 50 \u03bcg/mL. Biofilms grown without selamectin were used as CTR- and CTR+ was represented by biofilm treated with vancomycin at 512 \u03bcg/mL. After 24 h of treatment, the biofilm was washed with 1\u00d7PBS, and the biomass of the biofilm was quantified by adding 100 \u00b5L of 0.1% CV (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) to each well for 30 min at room temperature with agitation. The dye was removed by washing with 1\u00d7PBS. The solubilization of the biofilm took place with 98% ethanol for 40 min at room temperature under agitation. The absorbance at 570 nm was obtained via a microplate reader. The minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) was calculated according to the following formula:%\u00a0Biofilm\u00a0degradation=100\u2212Abs\u00a0570\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0test\u00a0sampleAbs\u00a0570\u00a0nm\u00a0of\u00a0CTR\u2212\u00d7100\n\n## 2.14. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Analysis\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy was exploited to evaluate the effects of selamectin on the preformed biofilm of the reference biofilm-producing S. aureus strain. Biofilms were grown on Nunc\u00ae Lab-Tek\u00ae II chamber slides (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) and treated with concentrations of 6.25 \u00b5g/mL or solvent control. Control biofilms were grown without selamectin. Biofilm cells were stained with the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), containing SYTO 9 dyes and propidium iodide (PI). Image acquisition was executed utilizing an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 710, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), with subsequent analysis performed employing Z-Stack software Z-STACK 3.0.2. In this process, a series of optical sections with a thickness of 1 \u00b5m each were sequentially captured along the z-axis across the entire biofilm specimen.\n\n## 2.15. Statistic Analysis\nThe tests were performed in biological triplicate and expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC50), 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90), 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), and 50% minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC50) values were calculated from the dose-effect curves by non-linear regression analysis via the software Graph Pad Prism 9.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). The significance of the difference between treated samples and CTR- was obtained via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett\u2019s test as post hoc by the software Graph Pad Prism 9.0 (USA). A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\n## 3.1. Antibacterial Activity\nThree different avermectin drugs were screened as potential bacterial growth inhibitors, using the broth microdilution method. The results were reported in Figure 2 and expressed as a percentage of growth inhibition compared to the untreated control. Among the three drugs examined, moxidectin and doramectin did not demonstrate significant antibacterial activity. In contrast, selamectin exhibited a profound impact on the growth of Gram-positive strains at a concentration of 6.3 \u00b5g/mL. The inherent resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to selamectin could be attributed to its inability to permeate the bacterial cell. Considering the importance of S. aureus in nosocomial infections, the antibacterial action of selamectin was further investigated against clinical isolates (CI1\u20135) of S. aureus. Selamectin displayed potent antibacterial activity against all tested clinical strains, encompassing multisensitive CI1, beta-lactamase producer CI2, quinolones resistant CI4 strain, methicillin-resistant CI5 strain, and CI3 strain with a constitutive resistance phenotype to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (cMLSB). Selamectin showed MIC50 values of 3.3, 3.4, 3.4, 5.7, 3.5, and 3.4 \u03bcg/mL and MIC90 of 6.1, 6.0, 6.0, 9.9, 6.6, and 6.4 \u03bcg/mL for ATCC 6538, CI1, CI2, CI3, CI4, and CI5, respectively (Figure 3). The kill rate of selamectin was assessed through the time kill test. The bactericidal activity of selamectin was assessed through time-kill tests. The control growth curve (CTR-) displayed an increase in bacterial load over time, indicating no inhibitory effect of the solvent. Conversely, vancomycin treatment for 20 h resulted in a significant reduction of more than 2.8 \u00d7 104 compared to the initial bacterial count. Treatment with selamectin at 3.1 \u00b5g/mL for ATCC 6538, CI1, CI2, CI4, and CI5, and 6.3 \u00b5g/mL for CI3 did not induce relevant growth inhibition compared to CTR-. In contrast, the treatments with 6.3 and 12.5 \u00b5g/mL for ATCC 6538, CI1, CI2, CI4, and CI5, and 12.5 and 25 \u00b5g/mL for CI3 caused bacterial growth failure, noting no change in the bacteria number compared to the initial bacterial load and indicating the bacteriostatic action of the drug. A decrease in bacterial load occurred after treatment of S. aureus strains with the drug at a concentration range of 25\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL. Specifically, a 53.8, 45, 52.9, 63.3, and 52-fold decrease for 25 \u00b5g/mL exposure, and 110.5, 100, 90, 107.7, and 85.7-fold decrease for 50 \u00b5g/mL occurred 20 h after treatment for ATCC 6538, CI1, CI2, CI4, and CI5 strains, respectively. For the CI3 strain, a decrease in bacterial load was observed in response to drug treatment at 50 and 100 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 4). A docking simulation of selamectin was performed to identify its probable interactions with 23S RNA structure derived from a wild-type and macrolide-resistant S. aureus. Patch Dock provided several interaction model solution options, evaluated through scores and the Atomic Contact Energy (ACE) of the complexes. The findings indicated that selamectin could exhibit a high binding affinity with 23S rRNA molecules. In detail, the drug probably enters the exit tunnel of the nascent peptide of the 50S ribosomal subunit, presumably interfering with the passage of the nascent peptide. Regarding the interactions between the wild-type 23S rRNA structure and selamectin, the most probable solution occupied an area of approximately 1232.80, exhibited a score of 9690, and an ACE of \u2212488.80 kcal/mol (Figure 5). On the other hand, the most likely condition of interaction between selamectin and macrolide-resistant 23S rRNA structure counted a score of 9554 and an ACE of \u2212574.50 kcal/mol, covering an area of 1207.50 (Figure 6). Selamectin-induced bacterial damage was evaluated by SEM (Figure 7). Physical damage with debris formation and reduction in bacterial numbers in response to treatment with 6.3 \u00b5g/mL selamectin occurred.\n\n## 3.2. Synergistic Activity of Selamectin with Ampicillin\nCombinations of two or more antibacterial agents offer a potential avenue for mitigating the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and revitalizing the efficacy of established antibiotics. In this context, we employed a checkerboard assay to explore the potential synergistic activity between selamectin and Ampicillin against the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain (CI5). A FICI value of 0.50 indicated synergy between ampicillin and selamectin. The 3.1 \u03bcg/mL dose of the drug reduced the MIC of ampicillin (125 \u03bcg/mL) by 125 times against CI5 strains (Figure 8A,B). To verify the nature of the synergistic effect, the killing kinetics of the combination (1 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin + 3.1 \u03bcg/mL selamectin) and the single components (1 \u03bcg/mL and 125 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin, 6.3 \u03bcg/mL and 3.1 \u03bcg/mL selamectin) were evaluated. The findings revealed that 3.1 \u03bcg/mL of selamectin and 1 \u03bcg/mL of ampicillin induced a growth pattern comparable to CTR-. When 3.1 \u03bcg/mL concentration of selamectin was combined with ampicillin at 1 \u03bcg/mL, the bacterial survival rate was reduced approximately 63 times compared to the initial bacterial load, after 20 h of treatment (Figure 8C).\n\n## 3.3. Survival of Intracellular S. aureus\nS. aureus is considered a facultative intracellular bacterium, surviving in the cell cytoplasm for varying periods of time. To evaluate the role of selamectin in counteracting the S. aureus intracellular survival in human keratinocytes, gentamicin protection assays were performed in the presence of the drug at concentrations ranging from 6.3 to 0.4 \u00b5g/mL. The effect of selamectin against intracellular MRSA followed a dose- and time-dependent trend. After 30 min of exposure, 6.3 and 3.1 \u00b5g/mL of the drug reduced the intracellular bacterial load by 22.5 and 11.8%, respectively (Figure 9A). Rates of 52 and 72.7% of bacteria relative to the CTR+ were detected, in response to treatment with selamectin at concentrations of 6.3 and 3.1 \u03bcg/mL for 1 h (Figure 9B). Drug exposure at doses of 6.3 and 3.1 \u00b5g/mL for 2 h reduced the intracellular bacterial load by 81.3 and 38.5%, respectively (Figure 9C). Non-significant differences compared to CTR+ were found in response to selamectin treatment at concentrations of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 \u03bcg/mL for different times of exposure, recording intracellular bacterial load rates higher than 87.7%, (Figure 9).\n\n## 3.4. Biofilm Degradation Activity\nThe capacity of S. aureus to establish disease-associated biofilms presents a serious challenge in eradicating bacteria from sites of infection. This is attributable to the high tolerance conferred by biofilms to antibiotic interventions, thereby fostering persistent and chronic infections. The impact of selamectin on the integrity of the mature S. aureus biofilm was evaluated (Figure 10). Biofilm biomass was quantified by the CV assay after treating the biofilm with 50\u20130.4 \u03bcg/mL of drug for 20 h. The treatment elicited a reduction of up to 82.3% in biomass at the highest concentration tested. At MIC concentrations, the S. aureus biofilm lost 51.5% of its mass compared to the drug solvent-treated biofilm. The extrapolated value of selamectin MBEC50 was 5.89 \u03bcg/mL. CLSM imaging of biofilms, treated with 6.3 \u00b5g/mL of selamectin, confirmed this finding. The images documented a thickness of the solvent and drug-treated biofilm equal to 22 and 8 \u03bcm, respectively (Figure 11A,B). A reduction in biofilm thickness of 63% and the appearance of lower-density regions occurred in response to treatment. No areas with cell mortality were detected, suggesting that the drug may have a bacteriostatic effect on the preformed S. aureus biofilm.\n\n## 3.5. Determination of Cytotoxicity\nThe assessment of selamectin\u2019s cytotoxic effects was conducted on HaCaT cells and erythrocytes through the utilization of MTT and hemolysis assays, respectively. The range of selamectin concentrations investigated spanned from 50 to 0.4 \u03bcg/mL. In both assays, Triton-X (0.1%) and DMSO (100%) were employed as positive controls (CTR+), achieving complete lysis at a rate of approximately 100%. The cytotoxic influence of selamectin on the HaCat cell line increased in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a cell death rate of 63% at the highest concentration tested and a calculated CC50 value of 24.94 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 12A). Selamectin\u2019s propensity to induce hemolysis was characterized by relatively modest rates, achieving lysis rates of 30% at the concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL. This drug showed no relevant hemolytic activity at concentrations below 12.5 \u03bcg/mL (<8.07%) (Figure 12B).\n\n## 4. Discussion\nS. aureus holds a significant position among clinical pathogens, being responsible for a diverse spectrum of community-based and nosocomial infections. The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains has added complexity to the treatment of S. aureus infections, due to the limited therapeutic options available. This challenge has garnered global attention from entities such as WHO and CDC. Of particular concern is the MRSA strain, which is acknowledged as one of the most critical human health pathogens. MRSA\u2019s ability to cause invasive infections and its resistance to multiple antibiotics have necessitated catalytic environmental remediations, monitoring programs, and the pursuit of new drug alternatives [23]. The emergence of resistant bacterial strains is often faster than the development of new antibiotic drugs, therefore, strategies that reduce the time and costs of drug approvals are necessary t",
