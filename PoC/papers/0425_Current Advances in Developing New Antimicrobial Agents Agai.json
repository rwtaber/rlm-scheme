Over the past two decades, the global incidence of NTM infections has risen steadily, underscoring an urgent unmet medical need. Treatment remains highly challenging due to intrinsic antimicrobial resistance and the requirement for prolonged multidrug regimens that are often poorly tolerated and associated with unsatisfactory outcomes. At the same time, the development of novel therapies has lagged behind other disease areas, hindered by the high costs of antimicrobial drug discovery and the relatively low commercial return compared with treatments for chronic conditions. Over the past decade, discovery and development have diversified across novel small molecules, next-generation analogues of existing classes, and adjunctive or host-directed strategies. While most candidates remain preclinical, several agents have advanced clinically in other infections, including gepotidacin (topoisomerase inhibitor; FDA-approved 2025 for urinary tract infection (UTI)), sulbactam-durlobactam (DBO \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor; FDA-approved 2023 for Acinetobacter baumannii complex), and contezolid, supporting repurposing opportunities for NTM.

  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nNon-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) comprise a diverse group of over 190 species and subspecies, widely distributed in the environment, particularly in water, soil, animals, and food sources. They can colonise mucosal surfaces, form biofilms, and persist intracellularly, making eradication with current antibiotics challenging [1]. NTMs are opportunistic pathogens capable of causing pulmonary, skin, and soft tissue infections, with pulmonary disease presenting as chronic cough, fever, fatigue, and weight loss [2]. Cutaneous and soft tissue manifestations include cellulitis, ulcers, and abscesses. The global incidence of NTM infections has risen in recent years, particularly among immunocompromised populations.\n\n## 1.1. Types of NTM\nCommon types of NTM include Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium smegmatis The most prevalent of these is MAC, followed by Mycobacterium abscessus and Mycobacterium kansasii [1].\n\n## 1.1.1. \nMAC is the most common cause of NTM disease. These slow-growing organisms do not conform to traditional Gram-positive or Gram-negative classifications but are instead categorised as acid-fast due to their resistance to standard staining techniques. The group primarily includes Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare. MAC infections are typically indolent but progressive, often requiring prolonged multidrug therapy, especially in individuals with chronic lung disease or HIV/AIDS [3].\n\n## 1.1.2. \nMycobacterium abscessus is a rapidly growing, biofilm-forming, Gram-positive mycobacterium. Like all mycobacteria, it possesses a cell wall rich in mycolic acids, but its unique structural features contribute to substantial antibiotic resistance. It is also capable of intracellular growth within human macrophages, which adds to the complexity of treatment [4]. Mycobacterium abscessus is particularly problematic in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) [5].\n\n## 1.1.3. \nMycobacterium kansasii is a slow-growing, acid-fast mycobacterium associated with pulmonary infections that can mimic tuberculosis [6]. It may also cause lymphadenitis, skin and soft tissue infections, and disseminated disease in immunocompromised individuals [7]. Like MAC, it does not fit neatly into Gram-positive or Gram-negative categories.\n\n## 1.1.4. \nMycobacterium smegmatis is a non-pathogenic, acid-fast mycobacterium commonly found in soil and water. While it can occasionally cause skin infections, it is generally considered safe and is widely used in research as a surrogate model for pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8]. Its genetic and structural similarities make it a valuable tool for early-stage drug development, where efficacy against Mycobacterium smegmatis may indicate potential against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\n## 1.2. Challenges in Developing New Antibacterials for NTM\nNTM is particularly problematic for people with underlying issues that impact the immune system, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and HIV, with some strains such as Mycobacterium abscessus being particularly difficult to treat in these patient populations. The clinical management of NTM is complicated by these comorbidities. Furthermore, the burden on these patients can be high with the need to take multiple drugs for long periods, both orally and intravenously, with the potential for surgery as a last resort.\nAnother challenge in the development of new drugs for NTM is the lack of predictive animal models. Traditional mouse models often fail to sustain NTM infections long enough to evaluate drug efficacy meaningfully [9]. Zebrafish are another commonly used model due to their genetic tractability and physiological similarity to humans [10]. They are useful as embryos can be generated quickly and easily, and they are optically transparent so bacterial colonisation can be easily observed [10]. However, neither of these models can fully replicate the complexities of human biology, especially in individuals with comorbidities and compromised immune systems as seen in many NTM patients; therefore, their translatability is limited. Furthermore, many preclinical studies report results in relation to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); however, it remains challenging to translate MIC values into clinical efficacy for NTM. As a review by Griffiths and Winthrop notes, most NTM drugs show poor or inconsistent correlations between in vitro MICs and real-world treatment outcomes, making MICs an unreliable guide to predicting clinical response [11].\nResearch into new treatments is further constrained by the high cost of drug development and the relatively low profitability of antibiotics compared to treatments for chronic conditions, meaning that the return on investment is challenging. In a discussion paper on the growing crisis in antibiotic research and development, the Wellcome Trust reports that the cost of developing and bringing a new drug to market is GBP 1.9 billion, whereas peak global sales of a new antimicrobial agent are only GBP 260 million per year, meaning that return on investment is not attractive [12]. One reason for this is that new antimicrobials will be used as a last resort, once all other treatment options have failed, and therefore the market share is poor. Reimbursement can also be challenging when so many generic products are available, and these drugs tend to attract low prices [12].\nAdded to this, drug development is a long process with high attrition rates at each development stage. The estimated rate of conversion for a New Chemical Entity (NCE) in Phase 1 into an approved pharmaceutical product is ~10% [13]. These challenges have contributed to the significant medical need to identify and progress additional treatment options.\n\n## 2. Epidemiology and Prevalence of NTM\nThe prevalence of NTM is challenging to identify due to it being difficult to diagnose by clinicians and not mandatory to report. However, in many countries, the prevalence of NTM has now exceeded that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [14], with the number of cases per year in the USA believed to be between 13.9 and 48 per 100,000 people [1].\nFigure 1a,b show the global prevalence of NTM pulmonary infection and NTM pulmonary disease, respectively [14]. As can be seen, where trends are available, the trend is increasing, with results showing an increase over time of 82% for NTM infection and 66% for NTM disease. However, there are many areas of grey where no trend data are available; as noted above, this could be due to the difficulties in diagnosing and the inconsistent global reporting of infection. Notably, for the UK, the rate of NTM infection appears to have a contradicting trend, and there is an increasing trend towards NTM disease.\nAlong with the global upward trend, there has also been an increase in prevalence of NTM in high-risk groups such as those with cystic fibrosis and COPD [15].\n\n## 3. Resistance Mechanisms in NTM and Current Treatment Options\nNTM can be difficult to treat due to their resistance to many antibiotics. Both intrinsic and extrinsic resistance mechanisms prevail in NTM. Intrinsic resistance mechanisms include the presence of efflux pumps, reduced drug uptake in the bacteria, enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic, and modification of bacterial targets. Additionally, resistance in NTM can be conferred by genetic polymorphism and the deletion of transcriptional regulators (Figure 2). Mycobacteria feature a thick, lipid-rich cell wall which acts as a physical barrier and reduces the uptake of antibiotics. This is complemented by the presence of efflux pumps, which actively expel antibiotics from the bacterial cell and reduce their effectiveness [16]. Intrinsic resistance is also conferred by enzymatic modification of antibiotics. A classic example of this is the modification of hydroxyl and amino groups in aminoglycoside antibiotics by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs), which renders aminoglycosides ineffective [16]. Furthermore, NTM species can modify the bacterial target sites that antibiotics act on, as seen commonly with macrolides. Erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) genes methylate 23S rRNA, the bacterial target of macrolides, and reduce macrolide binding affinity to the ribosome, conferring resistance [17]. Macrolide resistance is particularly concerning since these antibiotics are often the first-line treatment for NTM infections [18]. Moreover, recent studies have also shown that transcriptional regulators, particularly WhiB7, may participate in conferring resistance. When M. abscesses whiB7 (MAB_3508c) was deleted, increased susceptibility to macrolide, aminoglycoside, and tetracycline antibiotics was observed [19]. The impact of genetic polymorphisms in conserved drug target genes on antibiotic susceptibility in M. abscessus has also been studied [19]. A detailed discussion on the above can be found elsewhere [16,17,19].\nCurrent treatment options are limited and require a combination of multiple antibiotics, and outcomes for patients are often poor. The first-line treatment is generally an antimicrobial macrolide such as clarithromycin (CAM) or azithromycin, as well as ethambutol and a rifamycin taken for up to eighteen months [20]. Mycobacterium abscessus is the most difficult-to-treat variant of the NTM species with a treatment success rate of only 45% [21]. It can lead to lung, skin, and soft tissue infections, as well as disseminated infections. Immunocompromised individuals, such as those with cystic fibrosis or HIV, are particularly susceptible to infection. There is no standard treatment for Mycobacterium abscessus; treatment consists of a multidrug regime preceded by in vitro macrolide susceptibility testing [22]. Furthermore, Mycobacterium abscessus can produce two different morphotypes: a rough morphotype which is more clinically prevalent, and a smooth morphotype that can form biofilms, making it even harder to treat [4].\nMAC can cause infection in the respiratory tract and lymph nodes, as well as disseminated infections. The most common type of infection is pulmonary disease (NTM-PD). Like many forms of NTM, MAC is resistant to treatment with antibiotics [1]. The current recommendation for the treatment of MAC is antimicrobials, usually multidrug- and macrolide-based, given over many months [22].\n\n## 4. Advances in Drug Discovery and Development for NTM\nNTM is a significant and rising global health threat with cases increasing and antibiotic resistance posing a problem for treatment, particularly where comorbidities are present. Lack of investment from pharmaceutical companies due to the high attrition rate for new molecules, the challenges of clinical translatability, and the poor return on investment have added to the challenges with populating the drug development pipeline. This review will focus on current advancements in finding solutions to this public health threat.\n\n## 4.1. New Small-Molecule Compounds\nBenzoxaboroles are boron heterocyclic compounds that represent a potential new drug class for the treatment of a range of pharmacological targets, including NTM (Figure 3) [23]. EC/11770, a benzoxaborole, is a novel leucyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor that has shown efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and good anti-NTM activity in vitro, including against the difficult-to-treat Mycobacterium abscessus and the most prevalent NTM, MAC. EC/11770 was shown to inhibit growth of Mycobacterium abscessus in a biofilm growth assay with MICs between 0.7 and 1.2\u03bcM, including an MIC of 0.7 \u03bcM for the commonly used ATCC 19977 reference strain and 0.3 \u03bcM for MAC (Table 1) [24]. Tackling biofilm formation is a key challenge in NTM therapy, and these results are encouraging. In a murine infection model, EC/11770 produced a statistically significant 1.5 log reduction in lung CFU [24]. The compound also shows favourable physicochemical properties, including solubility of 349 \u03bcM, ChromLogD pH 7.4 of 0.97, and mouse clearance of 5 mL/min/kg, suggesting a likely BCS class of 1 and no anticipated formulation barriers.\nDong and colleagues tested GSK656, a 3-aminomethyl 4-halogen benzoxaborole, against 82 NTM isolates and demonstrated excellent activity against Mycobacterium abscessus, with all isolates showing MICs \u2264 25 mg/L. However, inherent resistance was noted for Mycobacterium intracellulare and MAC isolates, which displayed MICs > 8.0 mg/L [25]. In October 2023, GSK published encouraging results from a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial with GSK656 for the treatment of tuberculosis [26]. This programme may accelerate development in NTM by leveraging the existing safety package.\nTPP8, a tricyclic pyrrolopyrimidine (TPP) candidate, targets DNA gyrase and prevents DNA replication in a manner analogous to fluoroquinolones [27]. In vitro testing demonstrated potent activity against Mycobacterium abscessus, with MICs of 0.02\u20130.2 \u03bcM (Table 1). In an immunodeficient murine model, intraperitoneal dosing of 25 mg/kg reduced lung CFU approximately 20-fold, performing favourably compared to moxifloxacin and SPR720 at the same dose. However, the lack of oral bioavailability may hinder its clinical development, potentially requiring reformulation or alternative delivery routes.\nThe novel compound VOMG, recently described as a cell division inhibitor, has demonstrated potent activity against Mycobacterium abscessus and other pathogens [28]. By targeting bacterial division, VOMG represents a distinct mechanism of action compared to traditional antibiotics. Early in vitro and preclinical results show significant bactericidal activity, positioning VOMG as a notable addition to the emerging pipeline of NTM therapeutics [28].\nAnother example of a novel mechanism is 10-DEBC hydrochloride, which is believed to act as an Akt inhibitor. Akt plays a central role in cellular signalling, and inhibition interferes with pathways that allow cells to proliferate [22]. 10-DEBC demonstrated activity against both clarithromycin-resistant and susceptible Mycobacterium abscessus strains, with MIC90 values of 2.38\u20134.77 \u03bcg/mL. It also showed activity against biofilms (MIC90 50 \u03bcg/mL). To date, testing has been limited to in vitro work, and further studies are required to evaluate its in vivo potential and pharmacokinetic profile.\nGepotidacin, a first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene topoisomerase inhibitor, has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of urinary tract infection [29]. Against NTM isolates, gepotidacin was effective against ATCC 19977, with an MIC of 2 mg/L, comparing favourably to amikacin at 8 mg/L [30]. In a murine model of M. fortuitum, gepotidacin was more potent than amikacin at a 10-fold lower concentration. These findings suggest strong potential for repurposing to NTM indications, with the advantage of a robust safety data package already in place.\nCyclophostins, bicyclic compounds bearing a phosphonate moiety, have been investigated as inhibitors of serine hydrolases in mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium abscessus [31]. These compounds, and the closely related cyclipostins, display antimycobacterial activity both in extracellular cultures and within macrophages, with activity-based protein profiling suggesting targets among lipid metabolism and cell wall-associated enzymes. More recently, cyclipostin/cyclophostin analogues were shown to inhibit the erm(41) methyltransferase and thereby restore macrolide susceptibility in Mycobacterium abscessus, offering a potential route to overcoming inducible clarithromycin resistance [32]. Despite these promising findings, work on cyclophostins remains at the hit-to-lead stage, far earlier in the discovery pipeline compared with other compounds highlighted in this review.\nTaken together, five candidates\u2014gepotidacin, TPP8, 10-DEBC, GSK656, and EC/11770 (Figure 2)\u2014stand out as promising additions to the sparse pipeline of novel agents for NTM. While cyclophostins remain at an early discovery stage, gepotidacin and GSK656 are already in clinical development for other infections, providing an accelerated path forward for NTM indications. Among the preclinical candidates, EC/11770 appears especially promising given its activity against both Mycobacterium abscessus and MAC in biofilm and murine infection models, coupled with excellent physicochemical properties. The recent addition of VOMG highlights the growing diversification of mechanistic approaches being explored for NTM, broadening the potential avenues for future therapy.\n\n## 4.2. Scaffolds of Existing Drugs\nThe following section describes a range of new molecules that are scaffolds of drugs (Figure 4) being used for the treatment of other indications, such as mefloquine, a traditionally antimalarial agent, and bedaquiline, used for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nBenzimidazoles\u2019 primary mechanism of action in the context of mycobacterium is microtubule disruption by binding to beta-tubulin subunits. From the literature, two new molecules are under development as next-generation benzimidazoles\u2014EJMCh-6 and SPR719/720. EJMCh-6 is a new benzimidazole which targets the MmpL3 transporter. MmpL3 targeting is seen as a promising target for the treatment of NTM. Drugs work by inhibiting this protein and thereby inhibiting its transporter function, leading to cell death. EJMCh-6 was tested for the treatment of Mycobacterium abscessus in vitro using the CFU method, giving MICs of 2 \u03bcg/mL against a range of clinical isolates [33]. These assays were performed using well-characterised reference and mutant strains, including Mycobacterium abscessus CIP104536\u1d1b smooth and rough variants, PIPD1-resistant mutants, and MmpL3 overexpression and point mutation strains, including A309P. EJMCh-6 appears to be at the lead candidate phase, and no pharmacokinetic or in vivo data are reported, making it unclear how druggable the molecule is and hence appearing to be a long way from being a clinical candidate.\nSPR719 is a new benzimidazole that inhibits the ATPase activity of DNA gyrase B [34]. SPR719 has demonstrated good in vitro activity against Mycobacterium abscessus, MAC, and Mycobacterium kansasii, with MICs ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 \u03bcg/mL [35]. For these MIC studies, SPR719 was evaluated against a well-defined panel of laboratory and clinical NTM reference strains (Table 2). Furthermore, Pidot et al. investigated the in vitro activity of SPR719 in several NTM isolates that primarily cause skin infections (Mycobacterium ulcerans, Mycobacterium marinum, and Mycobacterium chimaera), finding MICs in the range of 0.125\u20134 \u03bcg/mL [36]. These studies employed well-characterised panels of clinical and environmental reference strains.\nSPR720, a prodrug that rapidly converts to SPR719, was being developed by Spero Therapeutics and successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials, achieving a predicted therapeutic, once-daily oral dose in the range of 500\u20131000 mg [37], and progressed into Phase 2 studies. However, interim results released in 2024 indicated that the trial did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, with bacterial clearance rates similar to background therapy. Spero has thus suspended further development on this compound [38,39]. While these results temper expectations for near-term clinical translation, the underlying potency of SPR719 reinforces DNA gyrase B as a validated target for NTM drug discovery, and future structural analogues may overcome the limitations encountered with SPR720.\n844 is a novel piperidine-4-carboxamide (P4C) and DNA gyrase inhibitor originally identified through in silico screening, which showed efficacy against Mycobacterium abscessus with MICs between 6 and 14 \u03bcM (Table 2) [40]. Similar to the benzimidazole SPR719, it works by inhibiting DNA gyrase in NTM by binding and inhibiting DNA supercoiling, leading to bactericidal death [41]. Despite showing promising MICs, 844 did not perform well in pharmacokinetic assays, with rapid elimination after both oral and subcutaneous administration in the mouse. Furthermore, it had limited permeability and metabolic instability in the mouse model, although it was more stable in rabbit, monkey, and human plasma [40]. Nonetheless, these pharmacokinetic characteristics suggest that 844 would be challenging to formulate into a viable oral formulation for NTM.\nLike EJMCh-6 and the other benzimidazoles described above, PIPD1 targets the mycolic acid transporter Mmlp3. PIPD1 was tested against a range of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium abscessus with an MIC of 0.125 \u03bcg/mL reported (Table 2). Furthermore, it was found to perform well in infected zebrafish embryos, with a statistically significant reduction in deaths when treated with 3 \u03bcg/mL PIPD1 compared to the untreated group [42]. During pharmacokinetic studies, PIPD1 was found to have low relative bioavailability in the mouse, so further modification is envisaged to improve the potential of PIPD1 before it becomes a clinical candidate [43].\nGallium compounds are a potential novel therapy against NTM. These compounds work by inhibiting Fe metabolism, disrupting iron-dependent metabolism pathways and therefore preventing bacterial proliferation. Gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3) and Ga-protoporphyrin showed potential as antimicrobial agents in reference and clinical strains of Mycobacterium abscessus [44]. This paper does not report on MICs in the same way as other papers, making it challenging to assess the comparability of these compounds. However, the paper did report that the findings were statistically significant. The team reported that Ga(NO3)3 has been tested in a Phase 1 clinical study of CF patients being treated for P. aeruginosa infection, with no significant toxicity reported [44]. Furthermore, gallium nitrate is currently in a Phase 1b open-label trial (enrolment started in 2021) for the treatment of adults with CF who are colonised with NTM [45]. In the study, the patients are continuously infused with gallium nitrate over five days at a dose of 200 mg/m2/day. The study is estimated to be completed in 2025. Ga-protoporphyrin, has only been tested in vitro, and therefore the toxicity profile and in vivo efficacy are yet to be explored [44].\nBermudez and colleagues explored four active enantiomers of mefloquine against MAC in a mouse model of infection. They found that these enantiomers were not as effective as mefloquine, with MIC50 between 32 and 64 \u03bcg/mL vs. 16 \u03bcg/mL for mefloquine. However, they postulated that these enantiomers could still be a viable treatment option as the neurotoxic burden of mefloquine is known to be high, whereas an early evaluation of toxicity in embryonic rat cell neurons in vitro showed that these were ~47% less toxic than mefloquine [46]. In an earlier paper, Bermudez and colleagues looked at SRI-286, an experimental thiosemicarbazone with good efficacy of 2 \u03bcg/mL in vitro and in vivo against MAC. SRI-286 was tested in combination with mefloquine and moxifloxacin for the treatment of MAC in mice, and it was found to be more effective than either treatment on its own [47]. However, the combination of mefloquine and moxifloxacin also shows good efficacy, which may call in to question the need to develop a novel drug when two marketed products work well in combination.\nFollowing a library screen of molecules previously found to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mann and colleagues identified and tested MMV688845, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, against a range of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium abscessus and found it to be broadly active, representing a promising starting point for a hit-to-lead discovery programme in this pathogen [48]. MMV688845 displayed activity against multiple reference strains and clinical isolates of Mycobacterium abscessus (Table 2), with an MIC90 ranging from 4.5 to 10 \u00b5M. It was also evaluated in macrophage infection models, both alone and in combination with other antibiotics such as rifabutin and rifampicin, where additive effects were observed [48]. However, despite its in vitro potency, MMV688845 demonstrated poor bioavailability in vivo, limiting its immediate potential as a direct clinical candidate. Structural optimisation strategies have therefore been suggested, with a particular focus on shielding the molecule\u2019s amide bonds from enzymatic hydrolysis to improve pharmacokinetic properties [48,49].\nTBAJ-876 and TBAJ-587 are next-generation diarylquinoline analogues of bedaquiline developed to reduce lipophilicity and cardiotoxicity while retaining or enhancing antimycobacterial activity. TBAJ-876 has advanced furthest in development and is now in phase 2 clinical trials for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [50]. It demonstrates lower cardiotoxic potential, potent activity against Mycobacterium abscessus (MIC 0.48\u20131.05 \u03bcM in ATCC 19977 and clinical isolates), and additive or synergistic effects with standard NTM agents such as clarithromycin and cefoxitin [51].\nTBAJ-587 has also completed Phase 1 trials though no results have been published [52]. In a large study of 11 reference strains and 194 clinical isolates, it showed strong in vitro and in vivo activity against Mycobacterium abscessus, with MIC values significantly lower than those of bedaquiline, imipenem, and clarithromycin [53]. Importantly, Xu et al. demonstrated that TBAJ-587 exhibited superior efficacy to bedaquiline in a murine model of tuberculosis carrying an Rv0678 resistance mutation, underscoring its potential to overcome resistance mechanisms that could also impact NTM therapy [54]. Although TBAJ-876 currently leads in clinical progression, both TBAJ-876 and TBAJ-587 represent promising candidates to overcome the limitations of bedaquiline, with potential to strengthen therapeutic regimens for drug-resistant Mycobacterium abscessus and other NTM infections.\nSudapyridine (WX-081), another next-generation diarylquinoline, has progressed in recent years with a growing body of preclinical and clinical data. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated potent activity against a wide range of NTM isolates, including Mycobacterium abscessus, with MIC values lower than those of bedaquiline [55]. This was followed by studies in a zebrafish infection model, where WX-081 showed significant in vivo activity against Mycobacterium abscessus [56]. Most recently, Zheng and colleagues confirmed both in vitro and in vivo efficacy against multiple NTM species, reinforcing its potential as a clinical candidate [57]. After successfully completing a Phase II clinical trial, it is currently undergoing Phase III trials. While WX-081 is further along the development pipeline than many experimental compounds, its clinical safety profile and comparative efficacy relative to TBAJ-876 and TBAJ-587 remain to be fully defined.\nSalicylanilides are a class of compounds with potential therapeutic application in a range of disease areas, including the treatment of NTM. They demonstrated MIC values ranging from 0.125 to 8 \u03bcM against reference strains of MAC and reference and clinical strains of Mycobacterium kansasii [58]. Although these are strong MIC ranges, the team did not test salicylanilides against the most treatment-resistant strain of NTM-Mycobacterium abscessus, which appears to be a limitation of the study. This could be because, alongside NTM species, the study also assessed Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococci, and the team may be prioritising these disease areas over NTM. This study is still in the in vitro phase and has not progressed to any in vivo assessments of efficacy, positioning it in the early stages of the development cycle.\n\n## 4.3. Other Antibiotics\nOne of the major focusses for new treatments is next-generation antibiotics. New antibiotics are a promising area of discovery, with many showing strong minimum inhibitory concentration levels against reference and clinical isolates of NTM. Additionally, many of the new antibiotics under review (Figure 5) are currently being progressed for the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or other bacterial infections and therefore have potentially a faster path to approval as repurposed drugs.\nGuo and colleagues explored a novel oxazolidinone called MRX-1 (contezolid) against 12 reference strains and 194 clinical isolates of NTM. It was most effective against Mycobacterium abscessus, with MICs between 0.25 mg/L and 64 mg/L (Table 3) [59]. MRX-1 is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and diabetic foot disease [60,61] and has already completed a trial for Gram-positive bacterial skin infections [62].\nKim et al. [63] tested the activity of LCB01-0371 against Mycobacterium abscessus in vitro as well as in a murine model of infection, where it was found to have comparable efficacy to linezolid with a reduction in CFU in lungs to 3.7 log10. However, it did not perform as well in the spleen and liver [63]. LCB01-0371 has successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials for safety and tolerability [64] and has also completed Phase 2 clinical trials for the study of pulmonary tuberculosis at doses ranging from 800 mg to 1200 mg per day [65]. However, as it has not shown to be as efficacious as other treatment options available for NTM (such as linezolid) in animal models, it is questionable whether it should progress further if demonstrable differentiation (such as improvement of side effects) is not seen.\nMadani et al. examined the antibacterial activity of 19 oxadiazolone-core derivatives to determine their antibacterial activity against both rough and smooth variants of Mycobacterium abscessus [66]. These OX derivatives had previously shown promise against Mycobacterium tuberculosis with a potentially diverse mechanism of action, as they worked both extracellularly on bacterial growth and intracellularly on infected macrophages, while showing low toxicity against host macroph",
