  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens represent a major global health challenge. This study included a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and systematic review to evaluate drug repurposing efforts against these pathogens, with a particular focus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection (2001-April 2025) using the query \"ESKAPE AND Drug Resistance AND Drug Repositioning\" and performed bibliometric analysis with Bibliometrix (RStudio 4.3.2), VOSviewer 1.6.20, and CiteSpace 6.2R6. In parallel, a systematic review was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify non-antibiotic agents with reported activity against resistant ESKAPE pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 443 articles were analyzed bibliometrically, and 141 eligible studies were included in the systematic review, among which 31 focused on drug-resistant P. aeruginosa. The United States, China, and India were the leading contributors, with notable institutional collaborations. Repurposed agents such as niclosamide and mitomycin C exhibited antibacterial activity through mechanisms including membrane permeability disruption, quorum sensing inhibition, and biofilm suppression. Many agents also showed synergistic effects when combined with conventional antibiotics. CONCLUSION: By integrating bibliometric mapping with systematic evidence synthesis, this study uniquely highlights both research trends and therapeutic potential in drug repurposing for ESKAPE pathogens. While repurposing offers advantages of reduced cost and faster development, translation remains constrained by toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and regulatory hurdles. Limitations include restriction to English-language studies and the use of selected databases. Future efforts should emphasize in vivo validation, clinical trials, and innovative delivery systems to accelerate clinical application.

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been recognized as one of the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2019, an estimated 4.95 million deaths were associated with AMR, with 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to bacterial resistance (Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2022). Without intervention, AMR may cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050 (Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborators, 2022; Walsh et al., 2023). The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that rising resistance could render even minor infections fatal (World Health Organization [WHO], 2014). Among resistant organisms, the \u201cESKAPE\u201d pathogens\u2013Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacterales\u2013are most concerning (Wan et al., 2020). Listed as WHO priority pathogens in 2017 (De Oliveira et al., 2020), they drive a disproportionate share of global AMR disease burden, causing severe hospital infections, treatment failures, and increased mortality and costs (Santajit and Indrawattana, 2016; Peterson and Kaur, 2018). Their spread, aided by genetic mutations and mobile genetic elements, further amplifies their impact (Peterson and Kaur, 2018; Santajit and Indrawattana, 2016).\nDrug repurposing (also termed repositioning, reprofiling, or re-tasking) offers a practical response to the urgent need for new antimicrobials. By using existing pharmacological and safety data, it can cut development costs by over $1 billion and halve FDA approval timelines compared with new drugs (Boyd et al., 2021; Low et al., 2020). Regulatory interest is growing: the EMA launched a repurposing pilot in 2021 (Jonker et al., 2024), and nearly 30% of recent FDA approvals involve repurposed agents (Ashburn and Thor, 2004). Its advantages include lower risk of unforeseen toxicity, fewer late-stage trial failures, and faster regulatory clearance (Sun et al., 2016a). Importantly, many repurposed drugs act via mechanisms distinct from traditional antibiotics, enabling them to bypass resistance pathways (Gontijo et al., 2021; Kaul et al., 2019). High-throughput screens have identified numerous candidates with unexpected antibacterial effects (Ayon, 2023; Blasco et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2021), and combining such agents with standard antibiotics may further enhance efficacy (Boyd et al., 2021).\nDespite these advances, knowledge remains fragmented. Bibliometric analysis, integrated with systematic review, can reveal research trends, influential contributors, and thematic hotspots, linking scientific evidence to translational priorities (Agarwal et al., 2016; Grant and Booth, 2009; van Eck and Waltman, 2010). Yet most prior reviews lack such comprehensive visual mapping, and systematic evaluations of non-antibiotic agents\u2013especially against P. aeruginosa\u2013are still scarce (Aggarwal et al., 2024; Jampilek, 2022; Liu et al., 2021). This study addresses these gaps by combining bibliometric mapping and systematic review to provide a holistic overview of the field, highlight promising agents, and clarify mechanisms with translational relevance.\n\n## Search strategy\nThe literature was systematically reviewed using the PRISMA (Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases to identify studies using drug repurposing approaches against drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens from inception to April 7, 2025. We used only published articles in the English language. The search strategy was: (\u201cEnterobacterales\u201d OR \u201cAcinetobacter baumannii\u201d OR \u201cPseudomonas aeruginosa\u201d OR \u201cKlebsiella pneumoniae\u201d OR \u201cStaphylococcus aureus\u201d OR \u201cEnterococcus faecium\u201d) AND \u201cDrug Resistance\u201d AND \u201cDrug Repositioning.\u201d Subject headings and related keywords were employed to find potential articles. The search strategy is displayed in Supplementary Table 1. The references of relevant studies were inspected to identify extra and follow-up studies. Two authors independently carried out database searches, and they excluded duplicates, examined titles and abstracts, and comprehensively evaluated the full texts to select potentially suitable studies. A third author joined the discussion and resolution when there were any discrepancies. The protocol of review has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251053437).\n\n## Bibliometric analysis\nAs one of the most extensively utilized academic databases, the Web of Science (WoS) encompasses over 12,000 high-quality journals and maintains comprehensive citation records (Jiang et al., 2023). We selected the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) as it is widely regarded as the most authoritative and standardized source for bibliometric research, ensuring reproducibility when applying tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix. If databases such as Scopus and Dimensions were added, their high degree of overlap with WoSCC would lead to redundancy, and WoSCC provides a more consistent dataset, particularly suitable for citation-based analysis. We conducted a search and export of relevant articles from the WoSCC, utilizing all available database versions. To ensure the relevance and quality of our dataset, we limited the search results to articles and article reviews. We then carefully selected the relevant publications and saved them in a plain.txt format for further analysis (Pilkington, 2018).\nThe software tools utilized for bibliometric analysis include Bibliometrix R package (R Core Team, 2016), VOSviewer 6.2R6 (van Eck and Waltman, 2010), and CiteSpace 6.2R6 (Synnestvedt et al., 2005). The Bibliometrix R package primarily focuses on quantitative analysis, where authors are extracted from the \u201cAU\u201d field within the dataset, the publication year is extracted from the PY field, keywords are extracted from the DE field, and the number of citations is extracted from the TC field. In this review, the Bibliometrix software (version 4.0.0) was used to tally the quantity of publications along with their citations, assess the frequency of key terms, gauge the intensity of cooperation among countries/authors, and develop a three-field plot visualization for keyword concurrence analysis.\nA comprehensive overview of the bibliometric analysis systematic review and process was presented in Figure 1, providing a clear understanding of the methodology utilized in the analysis.\n\n## Data extraction\nAfter the final selection of the articles to be included in the study, the required data was extracted onto a customized sheet. Three reviewers independently extracted the corresponding data from each article, including the repurpose drug, current application, Synergistic drugs, P. aeruginosa types, P. aeruginosa of Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), antibacterial activity, Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI), methods or models, antibacterial effect/mechanism, anti-biofilm activity, anti- quorum sensing (anti-QS) or anti-virulence, country of study and year of publication.\n\n## Literature publication and citations\nInitially, 1,715 records from electronic databases were screened through a comprehensive search. After removing 198 duplicates and screening the titles and abstracts of the remaining records, 1286 studies were excluded. After full-text reading and evaluation, ultimately 90 studies met the inclusion criteria, among which 31 studies involved drug repositioning of drug-resistant P. aeruginosa (Supplementary Table 2). A total of 1,395 articles related to drug repositioning of drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens were retrieved from the Web of Science database, among which 449 were included in the Web of Science Core Collection. By restricting language type, time and research type, 443 articles were finally included for quantitative analysis, including 376 articles and 67 reviews.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the annual publication volume and citation volume showed an overall fluctuating upward trend. Since 2008, the growth rate of publication volume has increased year by year, reaching a peak in 2024 (82 articles), indicating that the research activity in the field is continuing to rise. Since only data before April in 2025 are counted, the publication volume data for 2025 is not sufficient for the time being.\n\n## Research countries/regions\nThe research on drug repositioning for drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens covers 62 countries/regions around the world. The top 10 countries with the most publications were statistically analyzed (Supplementary Table 3). The United States ranked first with 110 publications and 5,740 citations, followed by China (84,1959) and India (65,943), indicating that the United States has made great contributions and had a positive impact in this field. We visualized the publication and cooperation of countries/regions. The geographical distribution map in Figure 3A shows that the papers in the field of drug repositioning for drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens are mainly published in Asian and North American countries. Figure 3B shows the annual publication volume of the top ten countries from 2006 to 2025. It can be observed that China and India have the highest annual growth rate. Figure 3C shows the level of international collaboration. The single-country author ratio (SCP) indicates the number of papers whose authors are from the same country, and the international collaboration ratio (MCP) indicates the number of papers that are co-authored with authors from other countries. The MCP ratio indicates the ratio of international collaboration. Combined with the chart, Australia (68.5%), Egypt (58.8%), and South Korea (25%) have relatively high rates of international collaboration. Figure 3D shows the average time for 43 countries to engage in international cooperation when the threshold is 2. Total link strength (TLS) indicates the intensity of cooperation. The United States is the first country to start international cooperation and has the most frequent cooperation with other countries (TLS = 69), while Turkey is the country that started international cooperation most recently.\n\n## Institutional contribution\nA total of 807 institutions were involved in research on drug repositioning for drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens A statistical analysis was conducted on the top 10 institutions with the highest number of publications (Supplementary Table 4). The institutions engaged in related scientific research are mainly from the United States, Australia and India. The first-ranked institution is Purdue University from the United States (12 publications, 797 citations), followed by Monash University in Australia (12 publications, 556 citations), and King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia (9 publications, 149 citations). Figure 4A shows the institutional cooperation relationship. Monash University (TLS = 29) has the most frequent and close cooperation with other institutions, while Purdue University (TLS = 13) and Monash University (TLS = 29) have formed the largest cooperation network with the two as the main body, which has promoted the development of this field. Institutions in the United States were the first to carry out academic research and cooperation in this field (Figure 4B), indicating that the United States has established a relatively complete institutional collaboration system, which has a far-reaching impact on the contribution to this field.\n\n## Author analysis\nA total of 2,570 authors have contributed to the research in the field of drug repositioning of drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. Supplementary Table 5 lists the top ten authors who published related papers. The first place is Li, Jian (8 papers, 388 citations) and Velkov, Tony (8 papers, 383 citations), and the third place is Page, Stephen and Trott, Darren (4 papers, 77 citations). The H-index is a quantitative indicator used to evaluate the academic influence of researchers. Among them, Li, Jian has the highest H-index, with a value of 8. A visual analysis of the author cooperation team is performed. Figure 5 uses a threshold of 2 to include 301 authors, of which only 26 authors have cooperation and contact. The results showed that two cooperation networks were formed among the authors, namely the team led by Li. Jian, Velkov, and Tony and the team led by Trott, Darren, Page, and Stephen, showing the characteristics of highly close teamwork. Among them, the team led by Li. Jian, Velkov, and Tony is still active in this field, and has made important contributions to the field of drug repositioning for drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens, and has a certain authority.\n\n## Highly productive journals and influential articles\nSupplementary Table 6 presents the ten journals with the highest number of publications on drug repositioning for drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. Frontiers in Microbiology topped the list with 30 articles, Antibiotics-Basel ranked second with 25 articles, and Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy ranked third with 18 articles. The top 10 journals in terms of JCR classification are mainly in the Q1 zone, and the research topics of the journals are related to microbiology and anti-infection. The most influential journal is the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, with an Impact Factor (IF) of 4.6. In order to visualize the relationship between journal citations and citations and understand the subjective distribution and development patterns of disciplines, we conducted a double-graph overlay analysis of journals, as shown in Figure 6. The left side is the citing journals and the right side is the cited journals. The colored paths between the two sides reflect the reference connection. There are mainly one green and one yellow path in the figure, indicating that Molecular, Biology, Immunology and Medicine, Medical, Clinical often cite journals in the disciplines of Molecular, Biology, Genetics.\nSupplementary Table 7 highlights the ten studies on drug repositioning for drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens that have attracted the greatest interest among researchers. These studies are mainly published in natural science and microbiology journals. The results of these studies have greatly influenced the development of the field and the research direction of scholars. Among them, the most frequently cited document is Antibiotics for Emerging Pathogens published by Fischbach, MA in the journal Science in 2009. The article points out that drug-resistant pathogens are becoming increasingly common, but the development of new antibiotics is progressing slowly. The article introduces methods for finding new \u201cscaffolds\u201d by mining microbial niches to obtain natural products and reusing synthetic molecular libraries. It also explores new directions for target-based antibiotic discovery strategies, emphasizing that new \u201cscaffolds\u201d are the key to dealing with drug resistance, and new scaffolds with different characteristics may play a role in future treatments. It ranks first with an average of 83 citations per year and a total of 1,421 citations. Through the analysis of co-citations of literature, we can reveal the research hotspots in the current discipline. Figure 7 analyzes the co-citations in the form of a timeline, which can show the changes in research hotspots over time. The results form 10 clusters, of which the largest cluster is \u201cdrug repurposing\u201d (#0). The earliest research topic in this field was \u201cClass-D \u03b2-lactamase\u201d (#9). The current research hotspots are mainly concentrated on \u201cdrug repurposing,\u201d \u201cantibacterial activity\u201d and \u201coxidative stress,\u201d indicating that drug repurposing has received widespread attention in the treatment of ESKAPE infection, mainly focusing on the antibacterial activity and mechanism of repositioned drugs.\n\n## Research hotspot analysis\nThrough keyword analysis, we can identify the hot areas of current academic research and reveal the evolution of hot topics, so as to grasp the research dynamics, trends, research topics and potential interdisciplinary connections in the field of drug repositioning of drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens, and establish the framework of the drug repositioning field of drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. The threshold was set to 10 and 70 of the 2,232 keywords retrieved from the abstract and title met the threshold. The keyword co-occurrence map was drawn using VOSviewer software. One node represents one keyword, and the node size is positively correlated with the frequency of keyword occurrence. The connections between nodes form different clusters, which are distinguished by different colors. The distance between nodes shows the connection strength. As shown in Figure 8A, the 70 keywords are divided into 9 clusters, focusing on different research topics: (1) The red and brown clusters focus on drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens and their characteristics research and drug discovery. Such as P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, resistance, drug repurposing, etc.; (2) Green and pink clusters focus on the epidemiology, treatment and antimicrobial research of drug-resistant bacteria, such as Acinetobacter Baumannii, epidemiology, phage therapy, etc., which jointly involve the epidemiological characteristics of drug-resistant bacteria, the exploration of treatment methods and the research of related antimicrobial drugs; (3) Blue, light blue and orange clusters revolve around drug-related research. Examples include auranofin and ciprofloxacin, encompassing various aspects such as drug efficacy, pharmacokinetics, the characteristics of different drugs, combination therapy effects, and pharmacokinetic studies; (4) Yellow and purple clusters focus on research methods and new antimicrobial methods. For example, it combines molecular docking, protein research methods with antimicrobial peptides and nanoparticles, involving the exploration of research techniques at the molecular level to new antimicrobial materials and drug discovery pathways.\nIn Figure 8B, the average publication year of each keyword is used as the score for color mapping, illustrating the temporal distribution of keyword clusters. Early research mainly focused on the basic characteristics of ESKAPE pathogens. The exploration was carried out around the essential characteristics of ESKAPE pathogens, such as studying strains and growth, trying to find ways to deal with drug resistance from these typical strains. Recent research has focused more on mechanisms and emerging technology applications, such as multidrug resistance, antimicrobial resistance, and drug repurposing, showing that researchers have explored more evidence for drug reuse through in-depth analysis of drug resistance mechanisms. In addition, it also focuses on hot spots such as nanoparticles and molecular docking, reflecting the trend and application exploration of accurately screening drugs with the help of molecular simulation technology in drug repositioning research, which provides new ways to solve the problem of drug resistance.\nWe use keyword emergence analysis to identify keywords that emerge frequently in a short period of time, which can more accurately capture the new scientific research directions and research theme changes in the field of drug repositioning for drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. This article uses the bibliometrix package to display the keyword emergence results in the form of pictures (Figure 9). It can be found that early research was mainly related to the study and treatment of the characteristics of ESKAPE pathogens, and understanding their basic properties as pathogens, which clarified the target objects for drug repositioning. When traditional antibiotics fail, they turn to non-antibacterial drug treatment methods, such as studying biotherapeutic phages and auranofins; and recent research is more closely centered on drug repositioning in the treatment of MDR ESKAPE pathogens, and in-depth research on the resistance mechanism of drug-resistant bacteria, precision drug screening, and the application of new drug carriers, such as biofilm, molecular docking of therapeutic methods, nanoparticles, and other new technologies. The research time span reflects the continuity of the topic, with \u201cmolecular characterization\u201d and \u201cgene sequencing\u201d being the longest-standing areas of focus. Keyword frequency highlights the popularity of research topics, with \u201cresistance\u201d and \u201cP. aeruginosa\u201d emerging as the most frequently studied in the field of drug repositioning for drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens.\n\n## Single-drug therapy\nA wide range of FDA-approved non-antibacterial drugs have demonstrated direct antibacterial activity against MDR or XDR P. aeruginosa in vitro, including anticancer, cardiovascular, antiparasitic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs), and psychiatric drugs. Among them, anticancer agents such as mitomycin C (MIC 0.031\u20130.062 \u03bcg/mL) (Domalaon et al., 2019a; Svedholm et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2020), carmofur (0.0125\u20130.2 mM) (Di Bonaventura et al., 2023), and doxorubicin (2\u201332 \u03bcg/mL) (Domalaon et al., 2019a) exhibited strong activity, largely through DNA damage and cell membrane disruption. The cardiovascular drug amlodipine (25\u201350 \u03bcg/mL) not only inhibited bacterial growth but also significantly attenuated biofilm formation and virulence factor expression (Sharma et al., 2024a,b). Among antiparasitic agents, niclosamide (2 \u03bcg/mL) showed the lowest MIC, likely related to disruption of the proton motive force, whereas oxirachamide and broxiquinolone showed moderate activity (Di Bonaventura et al., 2023; Domalaon et al., 2019c). Certain NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin, 34.2 \u03bcg/mL) and psychiatric drugs (e.g., sertraline, 16 \u03bcg/mL) displayed moderate inhibitory effects, with additional quorum sensing (QS) and biofilm interference activities (Endo et al., 2025; Serafin et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2024b). Other agents, such as vitamin C, exhibited auxiliary anti-bacterial or anti-virulence effects. Collectively, these findings suggest that multiple non-antibacterial drugs possess repurposing potential against P. aeruginosa through multi-target mechanisms, including enhanced membrane permeability, metabolic interference, and virulence suppression. Among them, mitomycin C, niclosamide, and amlodipine showed the most consistent and potent activity. Research in this area has expanded globally since 2015, with contributions primarily from China, the United States, Canada, Brazil, India, and Australia (Table 1).\n\n## Combination therapy\nSeveral non-antibacterial drugs also displayed significant synergistic effects when combined with traditional antibiotics, particularly polymyxins. For example, the anti-rheumatic agent auranofin and NSAIDs such as celecoxib reduced their MIC from >256 \u03bcg/mL to 0.5\u20134 \u03bcg/mL when combined with colistin, with FICI values < 0.5, indicating strong synergy (Feng et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2016b; Thangamani et al., 2015b). Antiparasitic drugs such as closantel, niclosamide, oxirane, and rafoxanide also showed marked synergy with colistin (FICI as low as 0.001), primarily via membrane damage and proton motive force disruption (Ding et al., 2024; Domalaon et al., 2019b, c; Lu et al., 2022). The \u03b11-adrenergic antagonist doxazosin combined with ciprofloxacin suppressed QS, reduced virulence, and significantly diminished biofilm burden, while sildenafil in combination with colistin or cefepime effectively inhibited and eradicated P. aeruginosa biofilms (Elfaky et al., 2023). Antidepressants such as fluoxetine and chlorpheniramine enhanced the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides or carbapenems by inhibiting efflux pumps, inducing ROS, and disrupting QS (Ahmed et al., 2024; de Melo Guedes et al., 2024). Mitomycin C, adenosine phosphate, and ribavirin also exhibited synergistic effects with antibiotics, simultaneously reducing MIC values and interfering with virulence regulatory networks (Domalaon et al., 2019a; Svedholm et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2022). Overall, research on combination strategies has expanded rapidly since 2020, with active contributions from China, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Australia. These studies consistently demonstrate that non-antibacterial drugs can enhance the efficacy of traditional antibiotics against MDR P. aeruginosa, with the most striking effects observed for antiparasitic and anti-rheumatic agents combined with colistin (Table 2).\n\n## Synthesis of patterns across drug classes\nBeyond individual agents, broader mechanistic themes emerged across drug classes. Disruption of bacterial membrane integrity or permeability was among the most frequently reported strategies, highlighting membrane destabilization as a central antibacterial mechanism. Efflux pump inhibition was another recurrent feature, consistently associated with improved susceptibility to conventional antibiotics. Many agents also targeted virulence regulation, particularly quorum sensing and biofilm formation, underscoring the value of attenuating pathogenicity as a complementary therapeutic approach. Finally, a substantial proportion of studies reported synergistic activity between repurposed drugs and standard antibiotics, emphasizing the translational potential of combination therapies for extending the utility of existing antimicrobials. Taken together, these findings suggest that the most promising directions for drug repurposing against ESKAPE pathogens lie in targeting bacterial membranes, efflux systems, and virulence traits, particularly when integrated with conventional antibiotics to maximize efficacy.\n\n## Therapeutic challenges in drug-resistant ESKAPE infections\nGlobally, antibiotic resistance has become a major public health threat, with ESKAPE pathogens representing typical MDR bacteria that cause severe infections and are extremely difficult to treat (Yu et al., 2020). Their resistance mechanisms are diverse and synergistic, including the production of inactivating enzymes (e.g., extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases in Klebsiella pneumoniae hydrolyzing the \u03b2-lactam ring), alterations of antibiotic targets (e.g., penicillin-binding protein changes in Staphylococcus aureus) (Fonseca et al., 2012), enhanced efflux pump activity (e.g., MexAB-OprM system in P. aeruginosa) (Sui et al., 2012), and biofilm formation that impedes drug penetration and reduces bacterial metabolic activity (Ribeiro et al., 2016). Current therapies are limited: polymyxins remain the last-line option against MDR Gram-negative bacteria but are restricted by nephrotoxicity (Nang et al., 2021); the development of new antibiotics is slow, costly, and inefficient; phage therapy has shown variable efficacy in drug-resistant P. aeruginosa infection depending on bacterial, phage, and host factors (Kortright et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2006a,b); and the clinical use of antimicrobial peptides or anti-virulence compounds is constrained by stability and mechanistic challenges (Allen et al., 2014; Mahlapuu et al., 2016; Theuretzbacher and Piddock, 2019). Against this backdrop, drug repositioning offers a promising strategy to combat MDR ESKAPE pathogens, as it leverages existing pharmacological and toxicological knowledge of approved drugs, thus reducing development costs and shortening approval timelines compared with de novo antibiotics (Konreddy et al., 2019; Peyclit et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2006a).\n\n## Comparison with similar reviews\nRecent systematic and narrative reviews have extensively explored the potential of drug repurposing against MDR pathogens. For example, Liu et al. (2021) concluded that combining non-antibiotic drugs with existing antibiotics can enhance therapeutic efficacy and inhibit the evolution of resistance. Similarly, Boyd et al. (2021) emphasized the translational advantages of drug repurposing by reducing development costs and establishing safety, but also cautioned that clinical evidence is limited. Our findings are consistent with these observations, demonstrating that many non-antibiotic drugs (e.g., anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiparasitic agents) exhibit synergistic antimicrobial activity when combined with traditional antibiotics. Notably, Gardy and Loman (2018) reported that structural motifs such as aromatic rings contribute to the antimicrobial activity of non-antibiotic drugs, consistent with our findings for several compounds.\nA major strength of this study lies in its combination of bibliometric analysis and systematic review, resulting in a more comprehensive assessment than either approach alone. Bibliometric analysis provides a macroscopic perspective, revealing global research trends, hotspots, and collaborative networks in the field of drug repurposing to combat antimicrobial resistance. The systematic review, on the other hand, provides a microscopic level of evidence synthesis, summarizing experimental data using strict inclusion criteria and systematically analyzing drug efficacy, mechanisms of action, and synergies with conventional antibiotics. By combining these two approaches, this study, based on bibliometric analysis, identified drug-resistant P. aeruginosa as a research hotspot among ESKAPE pathogens. Subsequently, a systematic review was used to include as many drug repurposing studies of drug-resistant P. aeruginosa as possible. This approach not only provides a more robust summary of the existing evidence but also identifies research gaps and emerging directions, providing insights for future research. This dual approach ensures the value of the research findings to a broad audience, including researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, and enhances their translational relevance.\n\n## Research status of drug repositioning against drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens\nThis study conducted a bibliometric analysis on the field of drug repositioning of drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens, and grasped the current status, development trends, and academic value of the field through the research results of countries, institutions, authors, journals, documents, and keyw",
