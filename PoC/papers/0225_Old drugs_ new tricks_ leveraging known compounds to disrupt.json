  "full_text": "## Introduction\nThough statistics vary between sites and are dependent on a host of comorbidities, between 20 and 60% of COVID-19 infected patients admitted to hospital develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1,2, with complications being a primary contributor to the mortality in up to 50% of these instances. Indeed, early evidence has suggested that COVID-19-induced ARDS may represent a specific variant thereof3,4. ARDS arises from complex interactions between components of the immune inflammatory response5,6 including complement activation7. This underlying inflammatory response appears especially aggressive in many cases of COVID-19 infection, with the self-aggravating release of increasing amounts of inflammatory cytokines fueling a run-away cytokine storm8,9. Though antiviral and immune-modulating agents are undergoing clinical trial, the sudden emergence and rapid global spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the quintessential value of rapidly identifying and redirecting tried and true pharmaceutical agents to immediately mitigate illness severity. This being said, the recent ad hoc use and subsequent failure of the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine in formal clinical trials10 suggests that important challenges remain if this is to be accomplished safely, effectively, and reliably. Current efforts have for the most part been focused on eliminating the root cause of infection with significant resources being applied to the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 molecular targets and the identification of novel antiviral compounds using molecular docking as the primary computational workhorse11,12. While conventional analyses of this type typically focus directly on individual virally encoded proteins, recent efforts have attempted to broaden their scope by mapping the pathogen-host interactome to identify downstream targets in the viral replication machinery that might be readily modulated using known compounds13,14. Though vital, these efforts are, by virtue of their single molecule resolution, both experimentally and computationally resource-intensive and time-consuming. An alternative and highly complementary means of reducing mortality in COVID-induced ARDS consist in appropriately modulating host immune response such that cytokine storm is averted. Unfortunately, while the molecular affinity approaches mentioned above are well-suited for identifying drugs binding with high specificity to a given target they require prior knowledge of what the appropriate target should be. Moreover, this time-independent analysis of binding affinity is ill-suited to describe the complex dynamics of immune cell signaling that lead to persistent cytokine storm where regulatory kinetics play a vital role in the selection of therapeutic targets.\nHere, we propose a novel and expedient in silico approach for the evaluation and selection of drug repurposing candidates directed at model-predicted targets that formally account for the regulatory dynamics of the network as a whole. Utilizing both experimental and model-predicted affinities as well as literature-mined drug\u2013target interaction data, we assemble and score multidrug therapies based on their expected regulatory actions on sets of concurrent molecular targets that act synergistically to disrupt cytokine storm in the context of coronavirus infection. Issues with data sparsity which are of special relevance in sudden and rapidly evolving health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, undermine the reliable use of data-driven approaches but can be circumvented by maximally leveraging the extraction of currently existing knowledge from the peer-reviewed literature. In previous work by our group15, we extracted prior knowledge from 2653 peer-reviewed publications to construct a network that included 18 host immune mediators documented to be of specific relevance to coronavirus infection, the latter being annotated as a disease entity in the Elsevier Knowledge Graph text-mining database16. These 18 immune mediators and the coronavirus pathogen were linked by 112 documented regulatory actions to create a network model that was capable of supporting biologically plausible immune response dynamics that included a persistent cytokine storm cascade17. Often lethal once triggered, this excessive and self-perpetuating host inflammatory response may persist in the absence of a pathogen as demonstrated recently in ref. 9. The objective of the current work therefore is to use the above-mentioned network model of host immune response to coronavirus infection as a basis for predicting intervention strategies capable of disrupting this run-away inflammatory cascade. Toward this, we conduct simulations of the host inflammatory response as part of an optimal search for companion drugs that would optimally compliment the actions of a concurrently administered antiviral, simulated here as an idealized reduction in viral titer. We focus in this first analysis on FDA-approved drugs as they might be more readily deployed but more importantly because there exists a broader more established base of clinical experience regarding their effects, compared to that of experimental compounds.\nOur simulations highlighted several drugs and drug combinations that show promise in disrupting cytokine storm when administered as companions to an effective antiviral. In addition to recovering, known immunosuppressants like rapamycin and cyclosporine, as well as the corticosteroid dexamethasone, model predictions also correctly assigned a low score to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two early contenders later proven to be much less effective than anticipated. Most importantly perhaps, our analysis pointed to several highly novel opportunities for significantly enhancing the actions of dexamethasone by pairing the latter with a select list of drugs that include antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, and the statin simvastatin. Though these remain predictions, we propose that this model-based framework, because it is rooted in a broad body of prior knowledge, can be highly useful in focusing attention to drug candidates with significant potential and do so quickly with minimal data.\n\n## Idealized interventions and suitability for repurposing\nOf the 19 original network models15, we focus here specifically on model 18, which we believe supports the most biologically plausible predicted immune response dynamics based on criteria described in17. Stating the search for idealized intervention sets as a constraint satisfaction problem18, we identified 30 intervention solutions15 that prompt immune signaling predicted by the network model to migrate from a pattern of persistent immune hyperactivation (cytokine storm) to one that more closely resembles an idealized immune resting state. These solutions were computed under conditions of low viral load to highlight best case performance and because they would be used in concert with an effective antiviral treatment. The exact combinations of exogenous manipulations proposed in each of these theoretically optimal solutions si are listed in Supplementary Table 1 (Additional File 1) along with summary measures of optimality, namely the number of exogenous manipulations, the outcome residual distance from the target immune resting state, the number of transitions required to achieve this outcome as well as the overall pharmacologic actionability A(s) as it applies to the repurposing of the 144 candidate drugs. The latter is reported along with the significance of this value compared to that of a random intervention set, adjusted for multiple comparisons (Padj). These summary measures are also presented graphically in Fig. 1. Results show that 16 of the 30 optimal intervention sets score as significantly actionable (empirical null distribution P\u2009<\u20090.05; A\u2009>\u20097.25) in the 144 candidate drugs compared to a random intervention set. Interestingly these 16 significantly actionable solutions involve only slightly fewer immune targets on average (~6 targets) than their nonsignificant counterparts (~7 targets) despite this being a component of the actionability score. This similarity notwithstanding, the specific combinations of targets selected in each of these 16 solutions effectively exploit the regulatory network structure in a way that supports a much more expedient or efficient migration (~7 versus ~14 transitions) to outcome states where at least 85% of immune marker expression is restored to the baseline healthy resting state (~4 versus ~9 activation increments from an initial separation of 27). Of the 18 immune proteins in the network, TNF, IFNL1 (aka IL-29), and CSF3 are almost unanimously shared among the most actionable solutions. Indeed, IFNL1 and TNF appear in almost twice as many significantly actionable MIS solutions as they do in their nonsignificant counterparts. The two most actionable idealized interventions both consist of a joint inhibition of CSF3, CTSL, CXCL2, IFNG, and TNF, with one also inhibiting IFNL1. Interestingly recent work by9 supports a central role for type II interferon IFNG and TNF synergy in COVID-related cytokine shock. However, much less is known about a direct role of type III IFNL1 in a cytokine storm, though recent work proposes the latter as a major mediator of thromboinflammation19, an emerging clinical feature of COVID-19 infection20.Fig. 1Suitability of optimal target sets for drug repurposing.A quantitative ranking of 30 model-predicted idealized interventions of various cardinality (green bars), length of response trajectory or efficiency (orange bars) and distance from optimal outcome (blue bars) as a function of their actionability (red line) or potential for translation into clinic using repurposing of currently available drugs. Only 16 of the initial 30 solution sets are significantly more accessible (empirical null distribution P\u2009<\u20090.05; A\u2009>\u2009Acrit, P=0.05 ~7.25) to repurposing than a random MIS solution set (dashed blue line).\n\n## Ranking individual drugs\nIn order to identify drug repurposing strategies that might be translatable into clinical practice, we computed for each drug and drug combination the adjusted enrichment Eadj in each of the 16 significantly actionable intervention sets. Of the 144 FDA-approved candidate drugs that were identified as illness and model-relevant (Fig. 2a), no single drug scored a weighted adjusted median enrichment (WM Eadj) that significantly exceeded that of a random selection from the background set of model relevant drugs in even one idealized MIS solution (all Padj (max Eadj)\u2009>\u20090.10) (Additional File 1, Supplementary Table 2). Indeed, only eight drugs scored above 0.30, with dexamethasone being among these and rapamycin ranking highest with a WM Eadj of 0.37. The much-publicized hydroxychloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine (CQ) aligned very poorly with model-predicted intervention sets, delivering WM Eadj values of 0.13 and 0.05, respectively, and at best a maximal Eadj of 0.34 and 35 in any single solution. The highest adjusted enrichment produced in any single MIS (max Eadj) was delivered by the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate, typically associated with menopausal hormone therapy but whose immune-modulatory actions have been highlighted recently21. Recall that the 16 significantly actionable interventions called for 6 targets on average to be manipulated (Additional File 1, Supplementary Table 1), a number consistent with the broad actions of drugs such as rapamycin, documented to inhibit eight network targets, as well as medroxyprogesterone acetate and dexamethasone, each known to inhibit six and nine network targets, respectively. However, this broad coverage of targets come at a price. Indeed, penalties applied to control for direct off-target effects as well as drug actions contrary to those prescribed by the MIS solutions were such that drugs like the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin, which is documented to inhibit only three network targets, may nonetheless produce enrichment scores similar to that of dexamethasone. Though very different in their breadth of coverage, both dexamethasone and ciprofloxacin were among the least generalizable across MIS solutions with median absolute deviations (0.16; 0.17, respectively) equivalent to half their weighted median Eadj performance (0.32; 0.34, respectively). In contrast, medroxyprogesterone acetate would appear to target network elements that are better conserved across intervention solutions with a median absolute deviation of 0.05 for a weighted median performance of 0.37, suggesting the latter more effectively targets complementary intervention pathways and may be more robust to model uncertainty. A similar argument could be made for the use of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine.Fig. 2A multi-pronged search for candidate compounds.a A total of 144 FDA-approved drugs were identified with consensus between three independent search methodologies. b Breakdown of the status of the subset of 67 drugs currently registered to clinical trials (July 27, 2020). c Breakdown of the 144 consensus drugs into the subset of 94 FDA Established Pharmacologic Classes (EPC) (of 540 EPC classes). Classes with fewer than three instances were collapsed to the other category.\nThe variability in performance across individual intervention solutions is further illustrated in Fig. 3. As expected, drugs at the top of the heatmap like rapamycin offer more consistent performance across those MIS solutions where treatment outcomes deviate by only two or three bits from the desired full- recovery profile. Indeed, even though drugs like raloxifene, sevoflurane (e.g., solution 25) and fenofibrate (e.g., solution 22) achieve higher adjusted enrichment scores in some isolated instances, they also present with no or even negative enrichment values in multiple other intervention solutions giving them a lower overall ranking. While most intervention solutions were supported reasonably well by at least one drug, this was not the case for solution 18 where all top-ranking drugs performed very poorly, presenting with uniformly negative enrichment scores. Intervention 18 (Additional File 1, Supplementary Table 1) is the single-most parsimonious of all significantly actionable intervention sets, consisting of only two-target manipulations, namely a downregulation of CD86 conducted in unison with an upregulation of TNF. As all other intervention sets involve four or more targets, broader-acting drugs are being favored overall, leading to a large overenrichment penalty for a two-target solution like that proposed under MIS 18. Of note, the importance of introducing drugs that more adequately align with solution 18 is undermined further by the latter\u2019s poor outcome which is among the 3 worst recovery profiles predicted (i.e., 9 bits separation from full recovery).Fig. 3Ranking single drugs.Adjusted enrichment Eadj values obtained in each of the 16 significantly actionable MIS interventions (empirical null distribution p(A(s))\u2009<\u20090.05) computed for the individual drugs with the top ten highest overall weighted median adjusted enrichment (WM Eadj). Drugs are ordered along the vertical axis by increasing weighted median Eadj and MIS solutions along the horizontal axis by increasing residual Manhattan distance (bits) separating the treatment outcome from the target healthy resting state.\n\n## Ranking drug combinations\nOf the roughly 10,000 possible pairwise combinations of the 144 candidate drugs, only 9 such pairs were enriched in at least one MIS solution at a significance of Padj(Max Eadj)\u2009<\u20090.05, with the corresponding significance in weighted median adjusted enrichment Padj(WM Eadj)\u2009<\u20090.10, both based on an empirical null distribution (Additional File 1, Supplementary Table 3). With a weighted median Eadj ranging from 0.46 to 0.52, all five significant drug pairs consisted of combining the corticosteroid dexamethasone with one of several companion drugs, namely cholinergic agonist acetylcholine, the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate, the antimicrobial ciprofloxacin, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or the statin simvastatin. Offering a slightly lower weighted median Eadj of 0.45 but with a much more consistent performance across MIS solutions was the combination of immunosuppressant cyclosporine with eltrombopag, a drug typically used to treat thrombocytopenia or abnormally low platelet count. Other high-ranking drug pairs also include the antimicrobial levofloxacin, the ACE inhibitor captopril, and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene. Here again, the performance of the top ten drug pairs at the level of individual intervention solutions is illustrated as a heatmap in Fig. 4. In contrast with the results presented in Fig. 3, we find strictly positive-enrichment scores for all drug pairs in intervention solutions with outcomes 2 to 3 bits away from a full recovery profile. Indeed, we find broad swaths of high positive-enrichment scores across the MIS solutions with the best outcomes (i.e., two bits separation) in particular for the top five drug pairs. Conversely, the added target coverage typically achieved by a drug pair only further exacerbates the overenrichment of MIS solution 18 leading to even more negative enrichment scores.Fig. 4Ranking drug combinations.Adjusted enrichment Eadj values obtained in each of the 16 significantly actionable MIS interventions (empirical null distribution p(A(s))\u2009<\u20090.05) computed for the drug pairs with the top ten highest overall weighted median adjusted enrichment (WM Eadj). Drug pairs are ordered along the vertical axis by increasing weighted median Eadj and MIS solutions along the horizontal axis by increasing residual Manhattan distance (bits) separating the treatment outcome from the target healthy resting state. Asterisks indicate an Eadj value with an empirical null distribution p(Eadj)\u2009<\u20090.05 significance.\nUltimately, we would like a drug or drug pair to show the highest possible enrichment Eadj in at least one intervention solution (Max Eadj) and have it maintain this enrichment across as many of the best performing MIS solutions as possible, i.e., also show a high weighted median Eadj. Results presented in Fig. 5 show that most top-ranking drug pairs typically deliver a maximum enrichment Eadj equivalent or superior to that of single drugs. Moreover, all such pairs invariably maintain this performance more readily across those alternative MIS solutions producing more desirable outcomes. Indeed, while the combination of dexamethasone and medroxyprogesterone acetate offers only a slight improvement in maximum enrichment over medroxyprogesterone acetate alone (max Eadj 0.63 over 0.62), this improvement is much better sustained across those alternative intervention solutions that correspond to more favorable outcomes (WM Eadj of 0.52 over 0.36). Introducing simvastatin in combination with dexamethasone or levofloxacin offers the potential for even higher maximum enrichments of 0.67 and 0.70, respectively, albeit with moderate reductions in general applicability across intervention paths (WM Eadj 0.46 and 0.44, respectively, from 0.52). In contrast, combining simvastatin with the JAK1/2 kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib, a combination currently in Phase 2 trials (NCT04348695), scored poorly in both metrics and ranked 662nd among all combinations. Generally, one can reason that combining drugs that offer highly complementary drug actions will increase their target coverage and more readily support a broader range of alternative intervention solutions. Conversely, drug pairs that offer higher maximum performance but do so on a narrower range of solutions might be expected to perform more like single drugs as their actions overlap, limiting their ability to support alternative treatment paths.Fig. 5Broad vs focused performance.Maximum adjusted enrichment (max Eadj) obtained for any single idealized intervention (MIS) versus the aggregate performance expressed as the weighted median adjusted enrichment (WM Eadj) across all 16 significantly actionable MIS solutions for the top ten ranked single drugs (blue dots) and drug pairs (orange dots) (Additional File 1, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).\nCombination therapies offer the potential of broader overall drug action, however, they also carry the possibility for negative drug-drug interactions. While severity rating categories differ from one drug information resource to another22, recently proposed a standardized severity scale that reconciled definitions across multiple sources into three basic severity categories, namely Major, Moderate and Mild severity. In this work, we extracted drug interaction severities for our top-ranking drug pairs (Additional File 1, Supplementary Table 3) as documented in the DrugBank23 Drug Interaction Checker (OMx Personal Health Analytics Inc., Edmonton, AB, Canada) which is based essentially on these same three severity class definitions (https://dev.drugbank.com/guides/terms/severity). Of these ten top-ranking drug pairs, only five were assigned documented interactions in the DrugBank database. The severity of these interactions was Moderate for all but one pair consisting of dexamethasone and simvastatin. The latter was assigned a Major interaction severity, whereby concurrent administration of dexamethasone can increase elimination of simvastatin, decreasing serum concentrations and compromising its therapeutic effect24. Likewise, co-administering simvastatin with ruxolitinib (NCT04348695) can increase the latter\u2019s serum concentration, affecting its tolerability and earning it a Major interaction assignment.\n\n## Simulating proposed Interventions\nIt is important to recall that candidates from the initial set of 144 illness-relevant, pathway relevant, and model-relevant compounds were ranked on the basis of their respective ability to align with and support model-predicted and idealized sets of concurrent manipulations to specific immune mediator targets. As real-world drugs or combinations thereof may not necessarily align exactly with these idealized interventions, we conducted simulations to verify the suitability of the best-ranked candidates. Results presented in Figs. 6 and 7 show the gradual decrease in disparity (Manhattan distance) between the predicted immune marker co-expression profile at each iteration and the target signature at the desired immune resting state imparted by the simulated drug therapy and its eventual discontinuation. The initial state of the network is a persistent cytokine storm located at a Manhattan distance of 13 bits away from the immune resting state. Drugs actions are simulated in the context of a concurrently applied idealized antiviral resulting in the absence of a measurable viral load.Fig. 6Simulating synergistic companions to dexamethasone.Discrete event simulation using synchronous state transition update of host immune network showing the overall Manhattan distance from the target immune resting state as a function of iteration. An idealized antiviral is applied to an initial persistent state approximating cytokine storm along with a dexamethasone alone, acetylcholine alone and a combination of both, b dexamethasone alone, medroxyprogesterone acetate alone and a combination of both, and c dexamethasone alone, ciprofloxacin alone and a combination of both, and d dexamethasone alone, rapamycin alone and a combination of both. In all cases, we see a positive synergy indicative of complementary drug actions.Fig. 7Simulating ineffective drug pairs.Discrete event simulation using synchronous state transition update of host immune network showing the overall Manhattan distance from the target immune resting state as a function of iteration. An idealized antiviral is applied to an initial persistent state approximating cytokine storm along with a cyclosporine alone, eltrombopag alone or a combination of both, and b simvastatin alone, levofloxacin alone or a combination of both.\nThe simulated effects of administering dexamethasone in combination with the 4 companion drugs that provided the highest WM Eadj (Fig. 5), namely acetylcholine, medroxyprogesterone acetate, ciprofloxacin and rapamycin, are illustrated in Fig. 6. While all these drugs applied alone will eventually drive the immune network response to a stable recovery state, pairing dexamethasone with these companion drugs shows a noticeable positive synergy that in all cases delivers a much more expedient reduction in immune activation. Indeed, the predicted immune network response to all four drug pairs shows an immediate disruption of the cytokine storm state, rapidly achieving a residual distance from the immune resting state of only 1\u2009bit within the first 4 iterations. This expediency is rivaled only by medroxyprogesterone acetate, with a repose time of 5 iterations, and is noticeably better than the responses of 8\u201312 iterations predicted for ciprofloxacin, acetylcholine and rapamycin. Importantly, all combinations produce a recovery that persists even after the intervention is discontinued. Different and more varied behaviors can be observed in drug pairs with decreasing values of WM Eadj that approach values obtained with single drugs (Fig. 5). For example, the pairing of cyclosporine with eltrombopag corresponds to an important reduction in WM Eadj or a loss in general applicability across multiple intervention paths that approaches that of a single drug. Accordingly, the simulated responses shown in Fig. 7a show a dominant effect of cyclosporine alone, with no additional benefit being contributed by the concurrent use of eltrombopag. At roughly the same reduction in WM Eadj, but with a much higher maximum enrichment in individual intervention, the pairing of simvastatin with levofloxacin provide an even greater emphasis on narrow performance at the expense coverage across paths to favorable outcomes. This even narrower focus not only eliminates any benefits of pairing but leads to a negative synergy where the actions of simvastatin alone dominate and where the latter is only hampered by the addition of levofloxacin (Fig. 7b). These examples suggest that as WM Eadj decreases, any benefit of pairing two drugs also decreases with the addition of a second companion drug having no effect or even counteracting the actions of the dominant drug.\n\n## Discussion\nWhile computational approaches, many of which are rooted in molecular docking methodology11, have been proposed to accelerate the data-driven screening of compounds targeting the COVID-19 pathogen or host proteins recruited during infection, little attention has been directed towards the in silico design of pharmacologic strategies for mitigating excessive host immune response, a key contributor to the severity of COVID-related ARDS and associated morbidity25. Moreover, while important resources like the VirHostNet database document interactions between virus and host proteins13, the resulting interaction networks remain static representations of molecular compatibility where drug targets are inferred on the basis of network structure alone. Similar principles of similarity have also been applied to transcriptomic profiles to construct drug-disease networks though once again candidate compounds are identified on the basis of network structure alone26,27. Here, we use a previously reported causal model of host immune regulation constructed by our group from published prior knowledge15 to implicitly account for and exploit the dynamic propagation of such network effects, and the resulting regulatory stability of the system, to identify subsets of dynamically coupled drug targets18. We then systematically apply a number of quantitative criteria to rank a broad range of candidate FDA-approved drugs based on their ability to jointly manipulate these subsets of immune mediators such that their corresponding downstream regulatory interactions are optimally leveraged to effectively disrupt a persistent ARDS-induced cytokine storm. The regulatory stability of this immune hyper-responsive state15 was such that only by concurrently modulating at least four host immune mediators would the host immune response be robustly directed to stand down in the context of a reduced viral load. Indeed, a closer examination of the 16 most pharmaceutically accessible intervention strategies revealed that drugs offering a broader coverage, in particular as it relates to the suppression of CSF3, IFNL1, TNF and to a lesser extent that of IFNG and STAT1, typically ranked higher. For these reasons many highly anticipated corticosteroids and antibody drugs did now fare as well as expected. For example, the antibody drug infliximab did rank among the top 20 drugs (ranked #14) with 7 documented targets. However, only two of these seven actions (TNF and IFNG) involved the five highly represented targets mentioned above, assigning it a lower rank. Similarly, prednisolone (ranked #31) counted five documented targets that included three of the five preferred targets. However, one of these three targets (CSF3) was regulated in the opposite direction to the action prescribed by the intervention sets leading to a penalty in rank.\nOut of 144 candidate drugs, even the 10 top-ranking candidates when used alone offered no better than a Padj\u2009~\u20090.10 chance of enrichment above that of any single random immune modulator in directly harnessing at least one of the model-predicted optimal treatment mechanisms active in COVID-induced ARDS (p(Max Eadj\u2009=\u20090)\u2009\u2265\u20090.11). Not surprisingly, the actions of these individual drugs did not generalize well either. Indeed, the ability of any single drug to simultaneously recruit multiple alternate treatment pathways supporting the best outcomes was also highly variable, with none achieving significance over a random immune modulator (padj(WM Eadj)\u2009\u2265\u20090.14). Figuring prominently in this list are several drugs currently und",
