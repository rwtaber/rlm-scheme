  "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) elicits an interferon (IFN) deficiency state, which aggravates the type I interferon deficiency and slow IFN responses, which associate with e.g. aging and obesity. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may also elicit a cytokine storm, which accounts for disease progression and ultimately the urgent need of ventilator support. Based upon several reports, it has been argued that early treatment with IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta, preferentially in the early disease stage, may prohibit disease progression. Similarly, preliminary studies have shown that JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment with ruxolitinib or baricitinib may decrease mortality by dampening the deadly cytokine storm, which - in addition to the virus itself - also contributes to multi-organ thrombosis and multi-organ failure. Herein, we describe the rationale for treatment with IFNs (alpha2 or beta) and ruxolitinib emphasizing the urgent need to explore these agents in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 - both as monotherapies and in combination. In this context, we take advantage of several safety and efficacy studies in patients with the chronic myeloproliferative blood cancers (essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis) (MPNs), in whom IFN-alpha2 and ruxolitinib have been used successfully for the last 10 (ruxolitinib) to 30 years (IFN) as monotherapies and most recently in combination as well. In the context of these agents being highly immunomodulating (IFN boosting immune cells and JAK1/2 inhibitors being highly immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory), we also discuss if statins and hydroxyurea, both agents possessing anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antiviral potentials, might be inexpensive agents to be repurposed in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection emerged in Wuhan, China 2019 [1,2]. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe to become as the most devastating pandemic in more than a century. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic carriers, upper respiratory tract disease to severe COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation [[1], [2], [3]]. In severely afflicted patients in need of ventilator support, the mortality rate is high - in particular in elderly patients and in patients with a severe comorbidity burden, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes mellitus and other inflammation-mediated comorbidities [[1], [2], [3]]. In addition to the above risk factors, virus strain and virus load have been shown to be determinant for the severity of the COVID-19 infection. The mortality rate in the COVID-19 infection is significantly higher than the latest influenza pandemic with the influenza virus H1N1 in 2009 [4]. Importantly, the most influential pathogenic factor determinant for the high mortality rate is an overwhelming hyperimmune response elicited by the SARS-CoV-2, giving rise to an immense cytokine storm \u2013 a hyperinflammation syndrome \u2013 that may ultimately culminate in acute refractory respiratory syndrome and fatal multi-organ failure [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Autopsy studies have unraveled that the COVID-19 infection is also associated with a massive thromboembolic disease burden [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]], which not only involves the pulmonary vessels but diffusely and markedly impacts the vascular system due to microthrombotic angiopathy and endothelial dysfunction, the latter being described as \u201cendothelialitis\u201d [12].\nSeveral clinical trials are currently investigating the best drugs to be used in the treatment of the COVID-19 infection. Most clinical trials include various anti-virus agents, either as monotherapy or in combination [25,26]. One of these anti-virus agents \u2013 remdesevir \u2013was recently reported to reduce time to recovery but without a significant reduction in mortality [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. Indeed, one study concluded that remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits [29], and a critical reappraisal of the use of remdesevir in COVID-19 afflicted patients concluded that it is far too premature to identify remdesivir as a life-saving intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic [32]. Based upon the preliminary results reported and without in-depth analysis of the safety profile, remdesevir was given a conditional marketing authorization in the EU on 3 July 2020 and was licensed by FDA on 22 October 2020 for the treatment of the COVID-19 infection with the recommendation to be used as early as possible during the COVID-19 infection [30,31].\nIn midst November 2020, WHO advised remdesevir not to be used in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection due to a lack of evidence that remdesivir improves significant outcomes such as reduced mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and time to clinical improvement [33]. Based on an analysis of 82 trials, the Copenhagen Trial Unit, Rigshospitalet Denmark, has concluded that remdesevir might benefit COVID-19 patients, but the certainty of evidence was low [34].\nSurprisingly, only a few studies have investigated the potential role of the oldest anti-virus agent \u2013interferon (IFN) \u2013 in the treatment of patients with the COVID-19 infection [[35], [36], [37]], mainly using inhaled IFN-beta [[38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]]. Since the initial results of remdesevir as a useful drug in reducing mortality in COVID-19 afflicted patients [[27], [28], [29], [30]] do not hold true after in depth analysis of all remedesvir trials and the drug is today not being recommended by WHO, there is an urgent need to investigate other drugs with the potential to dampen the cytokine storm [[1], [2], [3],[7], [8], [9]].\nIn this context, a Janus Kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor was suggested as a candidate drug, since it efficiently blocks the JAK- STAT (Signal Transduction and Transcription)) pathway and thereby the production and release of several potent inflammatory cytokines from different hyperactivated immune cells [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Therefore, several studies were subsequently launched, investigating the role of JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment - either as monotherapy or in various combinations - in the treatment of patients with the COVID-19 infection [25,26,[55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62]]. These studies are based upon the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity of the oldest JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]] and the immense hyperinflammation state which may be elicited by the COVID-19 virus [[7], [8], [9],[70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93]]. The urgent need to intensify investigations of JAK1/2 inhibitors in the treatment of severely COVID-19 afflicted patients has most recently been put in perspective as the efficacy of the other drug for treatment of severe COVID-19 \u2013 dexamethasone \u2013 [94] only associates with low to very low evidence after in depth analysis by among others WHO and The Copenhagen Trial Unit [33,34]. The excessive cytokine storm in severely afflicted patients with respiratory failure may not only associate with virus-induced hemophagocytosis [4,[7], [8], [9]] but also in several patients may contribute significantly to the pronounced thrombogenic state and the thrombotic microangiopathy [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. Therefore, targeting the cytokine storm by potent JAK1/2 inhibition [[7], [8], [9],26,[55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62]] may likely also reduce the risk of life-threatening thromboembolic disease burden by dampening inflammation-mediated in vivo leukocyte, platelet and endothelial activation and activation of the coagulation system as well. Furthermore, since not only platelets and endothelial cells are involved in COVID-19 induced thrombogenesis and the diffuse thrombotic microangiopathy, but also neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) are of paramount importance as well [[95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101]], targeting the myeloid compartment and NETosis might be equally important. In this context, IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta might be highly efficacious, dampening the inflammasome [102] and NETosis [103] together with a JAK1/2 inhibitor, which also impairs NET formation [104], and at the same time IFN potently inhibiting virus replication [[36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]]. Based upon experimental, clinical, molecular and immunological studies, we herein describe the rationales and perspectives for treating the COVID-19 infection with IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta in the early COVID-19 disease phase, and a JAK1/2 inhibitor in the later disease stage, either as monotherapies or in combination (IFN\u2009+\u2009JAK1/2 inhibitor). In addition, we describe inexpensive old drugs to be repurposed in the treatment of the COVID-19 infection \u2013 statins and hydroxyurea \u2013due to their anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antiviral capabilities.\n\n## Does treatment with a JAK1/2 inhibitor have the potential to improve clinical outcome in the severely afflicted patient with coronavirus infection?\nSeveral lines of evidence support the rationale for the use of JAK1/2 inhibition to extinguish the fire in COVID-19 pneumonia.\n1. As alluded to above, acute respiratory failure [1,2] is among others explained by virus-mediated severe hyperinflammation in the lungs as part of a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm syndrome [[7], [8], [9]].\n2. JAK1/2 inhibition with ruxolitinib has been successfully used for the last 10 years in the treatment of the chronic blood cancers - myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera (MPNs) [105]. Chronic inflammation is an important driving force for development and progression of these blood cancers, which accordingly have been described as \u201cA Human Inflammation Model \u201c[[106], [107], [108]]. Within hours/days, ruxolitinib alleviates inflammation-mediated symptoms and large spleens are being reduced within weeks to months. Several patients also suffer inflammatory connective tissue diseases, which are also markedly improved by treatment with ruxolitinib [109]. The highly beneficial effects of ruxolitinib treatment in MPN-patients are due to a rapid decline in elevated circulating inflammatory cytokines, which have been shown to impact prognosis and add important information in predicting prognosis in MPNs [110,111].\n3. In several COVID-19 patients, this cytokine storm is also associated with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis syndrome (HLS) \u2013 a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome which unfortunately in several patients is characterized by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia, low blood cell counts due to hemophagocytosis and multiorgan failure [4,[112], [113], [114], [115], [116]]. Murine models of HLS have confirmed the importance of inflammatory cytokines for the development of HLS [117], and the efficacy of JAK1/2 inhibition for its immediate resolution [[118], [119], [120], [121], [122], [123]]. Importantly, several clinical studies have shown ruxolitinib to be highly efficacious in HLS [[124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129], [130]], being most recently confirmed in several patients in a single center study [129]. Of note, in several of these patients, the cytokine storm was refractory to high-dose glucocorticoids [[124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129]], which neither previously were WHO recommended for the treatment of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) nor imminent multi-organ failure consequent to excessive hyperinflammation in intensive-care patients [131,132].\n4. Several single arm studies have already shown that JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment - either as monotherapy or in various combinations \u2013 may benefit patients with the COVID-19 infection [25,26,[55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62]]. As addressed above, the rationales for these studies are based upon the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of ruxolitinib [[63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]], and the immense hyperinflammation state which is elicited by the COVID-19 virus [[7], [8], [9],[70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93]].\n5. Baricitinib - another JAK1/2 inhibitor \u2013 is being used for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in addition to dampening inflammation, this agent may also affect cellular viral entry in COVID-19 [6]. Most recently, a large randomised trial has demonstrated combination therapy, baricitinib and remdesevir, to be superior to remdesevir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating clinical improvement among patients with COVID-19, in particular among those receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation [133].\n6. JAK 1/2 inhibition is being used in several other chronic inflammatory diseases, in which they often are highly efficaceous in controlling disease activity [134].\n7. Severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been shown to respond favourably to ruxolitinib, even in patients otherwise refractory to high-dose steroids [135], being attributed to its highly potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory capabilities. Accordingly, ruxolitinib is today FDA approved for the treatment of GVHD. Highly intriguing, a COVID-19 infection in an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient was attenuated on ruxolitinib treatment [57].\n8. As alluded to above, most recent studies have shown that NETosis is deeply involved in thrombogenesis and organ damage in COVID-19 afflicted patients [[95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101]]. Ruxolitinib inhibits NET formation in patients with MPN [104] and may likely do so in patients with COVID-19 as well.\n9. By inhibiting B-cells, ruxolitinib may decrease the production of autoantibodies against IFN and thereby prohibit the aggravation of the IFN deficiency state, which is also being elicited by the COVID-19 virus itself [136]. The rationales for treatment of COVID-19 with JAK1/2 inhibitors are summarized in Table 1\n.Table 1Rationales for Treatment with a JAK1/2 Inhibitor in Patients with COVID-19.Table 1Abbreviations: IFN = Interferon; HLS = Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Syndrome; GVHD = Graft Versus Host Disease.\n\n## Rationale for treatment of the COVID-19 infection with Interferon-alpha2 or beta\nType I IFNs-alpha2/beta are potent antiviral agents, which have both direct inhibitory effects on viral replication and also support and enhance the immune response to improve clearance of the virus infection [[35], [36], [37]]. Treatment of hospitalized SARS-CoV patients with IFN-alpha2 during the SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto in 2003 showed an accelerated resolution of lung abnormalities [137]. Several rationales and studies support the contention that IFN-alpha2a/2b or IFN-beta may also impact the clinical course of the COVID-19 infection [[41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53]].\n1 SARS-CoV-2 was found to be more susceptible to type I interferons than SARS-CoV [41].\n2. In an uncontrolled, exploratory study of patients moderately afflicted by COVID-19, Zhou et al. showed that nebulized IFN-alpha2b therapy shortened duration of viral shedding and reduced markers of acute inflammation such as CRP and interleukin (IL) IL-6, which correlated with the shortened virus shedding [49]. The importance of IFN-mediated reduction in virus shedding was underscored in the context of dampening population spread [49]. In addition, this important first study of IFN-alpha2 in COVID-19 afflicted patients highlighted that the concurrent reduction in inflammatory markers, including IL-6, might also influence the detrimental impact of this cytokine upon prognosis [49] but also emphasized that targeting the cause (SARS-CoV-2) by IFN-alpha2b might be a more rational approach than targeting the symptoms by blocking the IL-6 receptor, using e.g tocilizumab or sarilumab [49].\n3. A multicenter study of the safety and efficacy of early intervention with IFN showed that early IFN therapy was associated with favourable responses in COVID-19 patients [48].\n4. In a prospective randomised trial adding IFN-beta by injection to the anti-virus agents lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin in patients with mild or moderate disease at the time of enrolment displayed superiorty in the IFN-arm in regard to a significant reduction in duration of virus shedding and significant differences in outcomes as well. It is important to note that IFN-beta was given in the combination group only to patients who were enrolled less than 7 days after onset of symptoms [45,46].\n5. Nebulized IFN-beta inhalation therapy was associated with decreased mortality in Chinese COVID-19 patients and has also demonstrated safety and efficacy in other studies with a rapid viral clearance in concert with clinical improvement [138,139]. The rationales for using nebulized IFN-beta inhalation therapy have recently been reviewed [139].\n6. IFN may also impact regression of lung fibrosis after COVID-19 [140], and SARS-CoV-2 has been shown not to elicit a significant induction of types I, II, or III interferons in ex-vivo infected human lung tissues as compared with 2003 SARS-CoV [141]. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have developed a distinct machinery, which is able to shut down host IFN production, which subsequently has been convincingly demonstrated in several studies [[142], [143], [144]]. Thus, Blanco-Melo et al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced only a very weak type 1 and III IFN response, which was juxtaposed to a cytokine storm with highly elevated serum IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels [142]. Similarly, in a comprehensive study of inflammatory and immunological signatures in COVID-19 patients, Hadjadj et al. reported low IFN-alpha2 plasma levels [144]. Low IFN-alpha2 levels preceded clinical deterioration, and distinct patterns of circulating IFN-alpha2 characterized each disease grade. Furthermore, IFN activity in serum of severe or critical ill patients was also lower than that of mild-to-moderate ill patients [144]. In all three studies, serum IFN-beta concentrations were undetectable as well [[131], [132], [133]]. Since type I IFN deficiency is associated with hyperinflammation driven by NF-\u03baB and lower viral clearance, their results definitely support the contention that the early use of IFN - likely in combination with targeted anti-inflammatory therapies, which will be addressed below - may overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection by preventing rapid virus spreading and the subsequent damaging cytokine storm [42,145]. This may also hold true for patients with severe infection, since the most severe cases of COVID-19 were featured by impaired IFN-alpha2 production and higher virus loads [142,143].\nAs noted above, type I IFN production may not only be reduced or exhausted in the severely afflicted patients [142,143] but indeed being an early event, elicited by the SARS-CoV-2 itself, since recent cellular and animal studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits type I and III IFN induction [146].\n7. IFN beta decreases virus-induced lung fibrosis in a mouse model, which might improve outcomes of COVID-19 patients severely afflicted by ARDS [140,141].\n8. Most recently, novel genetic mechanisms of critical illness in COVID-19 have been unravelled in an extensive genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2244 critically ill UK COVID-19 patients [147]. Highly intriguing, increased expression of the interferon receptor subunit IFNAR2, which is critical for an adequate response to viral infections was found to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19, implying IFNAR2 to have a protective role against severe COVID-19. It was concluded that IFN treatment of COVID-19 patients may reduce the risk of critical illness [147]. The critical role of IFNAR2 in the context of protecting against severe COVID-19 is substantiated by the reported associations between loss-of function mutations in IFNAR2 and severe virus diseases [148,149], including severe COVID-19 [150].\n9. \u201cHigh-risk profile\u201d patients for serious disease and mortality from COVID-19, e.g. the elderly and obese patients [151] have been shown to have impaired IFN-responses [152,153]. Thus, elderly people and obese patients may in particular benefit from early treatment with IFN. The concept of an association between a type I IFN deficiency state and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and seriousness of the disease is supported by the mild courses of the COVID-19 in most children, who have a much more robust type I IFN response than the elderly [154].\n10. IFN has been shown to normoregulate or significantly downregulate upregulated thromboinflammatory genes, including PAD4 in patients with MPNs [103]. Normo- or downregulation of thromboinflammatory genes by IFN may likely decrease NETosis formation in patients with COVID-19 infection as well and accordingly the increased risk of thrombosis. Since oxidative stress is also closely associated with thrombogenesis by several mechanisms [155], it is important to note that IFN-alpha2 has been shown to significantly downregulate upregulated oxidative stress genes and upregulate downregulated anti-oxidative defence genes in patients with MPNs [156].\n11. In a mouse model of arthritis, IFN-alpha2 decreased the production of several cytokines, including IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)) and increased the serum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) after antigen stimulation [157]. IFN-alpha2 also elicited an early macrophage-derived production of TGF-\u03b2 combined with a later increase in CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells producing TGF-\u03b2 [157]. Interestingly, in the early phase after immmunisation, presence of IFN-alpha2 inhibited production of IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 whereas IFN-\u03b3, including macrophages producing IFN-\u03b3 was inhibited at later times [157]. The inhibitory effect of type I IFNs on Th1 immunity (IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 signaling) has also been recorded in monocytes [158]. Taken into account the prominent role of the monocyte-macrophage system in the development of tissue damage during the COVID-19 infection [[159], [160], [161], [162], [163]], the observations of the impact of IFN-alpha2 upon cytokine levels additionally support the early administration of IFN-alpha2 in COVID-19 afflicted patients, thereby likely decreasing elevated levels of several highly important cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3) which are considered of utmost importance for the development of the cytokine storm and ultimately multi-organ failure. The early inhibition of Th1-promoting cytokines, especially IL-12, by IFN-alpha2 may also be timely and of utmost importance when considering that IFN-alpha2 might lower the increased number of T-helper cells (CD4+) during the COVID-19 infection and thereby also decreasing the production of the Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3. Importantly, IFN-alpha2 has been shown to induce a marked increase in circulating CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells (Tregs) [164]. TGF-\u03b2 is an important mediator for development of both Tregs [165] and their immunosuppressive capacity. Of note, TGF-\u03b2, in contrast to all other analyzed cytokines, was significantly increased in mice treated with IFN-alpha2 [157]. Highly interesting, type I IFN also negatively regulates CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell responses through IL-10-producing CD4\u2009+\u2009T regulatory cells [166].\n12. Type I IFNs exert a variety of effects on monocytes, including rapid differentiation of monocytes into activated dendritic cells, which \u2013 together with IFN-induced activation of NK-cells \u2013 is considered of utmost importance for the rapid development of a robust antiviral response [[167], [168], [169]]. Based upon the above observations, we hypothesize that the administration of IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta in COVID-19 patients induces a tolerogenic state by a concert of actions, including inhibition of virus replication, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, especially early IL-6 production, early enhancement of TGF-\u03b2-producing macrophages, resulting in fewer IFN-\u03b3- and IL-17-producing CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells and at a later stage development of TGF-\u03b2-producing CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells. Rationales for therapy with IFN-alpha2 or beta in patients with COVID-19 are summarized in Table 2\n.Table 2Rationales for Treatment with Interferon-alpha2 and Interferon-beta in Patients with COVID-19.Table 2Abbreviations: IFN = Interferon; HLS = Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis Syndrome; ND = No Data; ET = Essential Thrombocythemia; PV = Polycythemia vera.\n\n## Rationale for combination therapy with interferon and JAK1/2 inhibitor in COVID-19\nSince several experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated both IFNs (-alpha2 or -beta) and JAK1/2 inhibitor therapy to inhibit several disease-promoting mechanisms in patients with COVID-19 as summarized in all the above mentioned rationales for monotherapy with IFNs and JAK1/2 inhibitors, it is tempting to speculate whether a combination of these agents might indeed be superior to single agent therapies. In the context of combination therapy with an activator of antiviral immunity (IFN) and an inhibitor of antiviral signaling (JAK/STAT inhibitor) one may wonder, whether JAK/STAT inhibition might not impair the efficacy of IFN. However, our clinical trials in MPN-patients have shown that these two agents actually act in synergy, implying an enhanced efficacy of this combination therapy. As addressed below, these highly interesting and encouraging findings may be explained by several mechanisms, including the fact that e.g ruxolitinib has a half-life of only a few hours leaving an open window of several hours per day for IFN-signalling. Other mechanisms might be that JAK/STAT inhibition dampens inflammation, which has been reported to impair IFN-signalling by degradation of the IFN-receptor (please, see below). Indeed, we believe that the avenue is already open for pilot studies combining IFN and JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment in well-designed trials, thereby prohibiting virus replication and virus shedding (IFNs) in concert with a massive boosting of virtually all immune cells (IFNs) and concurrently dampening the hyperinflammation (IFNs and JAK1/2 inhibition), which may ultimatively elicit the life-threatening cytokine storm. Importantly, inflammation is associated with impaired efficacy of IFN-alpha2 [170]. All effects of IFN-alpha2 and beta are elicited through interaction with the type I IFN receptors which consists of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains, and inflammation-mediated downregulation of IFNAR1 is associated with refractoriness to IFN [171]. In this context, it is important to note that the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1-\u03b1 (IL1-\u03b1) and TNF-\u03b1, which are elevated in COVID-19 patients in the hyperinflammatory stage, stimulate IFNAR1 degradation and accordingly attenuate IFN-alpha2 signaling [170]. Similarly, unresponsiveness to IFN-alpha2 in hepatitis patients may be explained by oxidative stress, impairing IFN-alpha2 signaling [172]. As noted previously, COVID-19 afflicted patients display increased levels of several inflammatory cytokines, including IL1-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1, the highest levels being reported in patients with imminent respiratory failure. Thus, in this perspective, treating COVID-19 patients with IFN-alpha2 at the earliest disease-stage possible, when the inflammatory state is less pronounced, seems to be a more rational approach than initiating IFN-alpha2 later when the inflammatory load is increasing and therefore the efficacy of IFN is declining and potentially harmful. The early intervention with IFN has recently been supported by mathematical modelling studies of the COVID-19 infection, showing that the earlier IFN is instituted the better the treatment response (92). These model simulation studies also support the concept that anti-inflammatory or antiviral treatments combined with IFN are effective in reducing the duration of the viral plateau phase and in diminishing the time to recovery (92).\nThe rationales of studies on combination therapy with JAK1/2 inhibitor and IFN (COMBI) are also encouraged by Danish safety and efficacy studies of COMBI in patients with myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, displaying highly encouraging results with rapid resolution of inflammation-mediated MPN symptoms and improvement in disease activity of other inflammatory diseases in MPN-patients as well [173]. These studies have demonstrated IFN-alpha2 and ruxolitinib to exert synergistic effects, implying reduced dosages of both IFN and ruxolitinib to obtain normalization of elevated leukocyte and platelet counts. Accordingly, we envisage COMBI in COVID-19 to be disease modifying in terms of shortening of virus shedding, shortening of time with symptoms, reduction in symptom score and severity and ultimately in reducing the risk of complications, including thromboses, and risk of disease progression towards terminal multi-organ failure. Rationales for combination therapy with IFN-alpha2 or beta and JAK1/2 inhibitor (COMBI) in patients with COVID-19 are summarized in Table 3\n.Table 3Rationales for Combination Therapy with Interferon-alpha2 or beta and JAK1/2 inhibitor (COMBI) in Patients with COVID-19.Table 3\n\n## Does interferon-alpha2 protect against COVID-19 infection?\nInterferon-alpha2 has been used for decades in the treatment of hepatitis B and C [174]. In addition, it has been used previously in the treatment of HIV-infection [174]. As addressed above, several studies have been performed or are ongoing, investigating the safety and efficacy of IFN in the treatment of infection with COVID-19, either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-viral agents [[45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54],139,[142], [143], [144]]. During the last 30 years, IFN-alpha2 has been used in the treatment of patients with MPNs [106]. Within weeks to months, IFN-alpha2 normalizes elevated blood cell counts. The mechanisms of action of IFN-alpha2 in MPNs are likely \u2013 among others - attributed to a potent enhancement and boosting of virtually all immune cells (dendritic cells, NK-cells, T cells and B-cells as well). It is a clinical experience that MPN-patients being treated with IFN-alpha2 more rarely are afflicted by infections, including viral infections, but no larger studies have explored this potential effect of IFN-alpha2. From current registry studies on all Danish IFN-alpha2 treated patients (estimated to be approximately 1000 patients) with collection of data on the frequency of COVID-19 infection, the severity of the COVID-19 infection in terms of the need of hospitalization and need of mechanical ventilation, we envisage to provide highly important information on the frequency of COVID-19 infection in IFN-alpha2 treated patients and whether treatment with IFN-alpha2 might actually protect against COVID-19 infection and reduce the risk of serious or critical disease.\n\n## Does JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment protect against development of a life-threatening cytokine storm in COVID-19 afflicted patients?\nTaking into account the reduction of inflammatory cytokines in MPN patients being treated with ruxolitinib and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis on treatment with baricitinib, it is tempting to speculate whether these patients may actually be protected aga",
