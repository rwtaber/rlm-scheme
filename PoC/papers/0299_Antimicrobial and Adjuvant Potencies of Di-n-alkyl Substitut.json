  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nAlthough the COVID-19 viral pandemic has dominated the news during the past several years, the importance of the antibiotic resistance crisis to worldwide human health remains critical and requires little introduction [1,2,3]. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [4] and the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued various reports expressing urgent concern. The problem is both increasing resistance and the dearth of novel antimicrobials in current drug pipelines [5,6]. The search in nature for new structures having antimicrobial activity remains an important approach to finding new antibiotics. Another approach involves the synthesis of new derivatives of known drugs or even of novel chemical structures\u2014often compounds inspired by antimicrobial peptides [7,8]. The goals are to enhance potency, to minimize mammalian cytotoxicity, to overcome resistance, to minimize drug interactions, or all four. Recent work in developing macrocycles [9], peptides [10,11], peptoids [12], and cyclic peptides [13] exemplify the \u201cnovel structure\u201d approach. Various crown ethers have also shown a range of biological activity [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23] against microbes and mammals, as have a variety of natural alternatives [24].\nAmphiphilic peptides [25,26,27,28,29,30] comprise an important class of antimicrobials. These are often isolated from bacteria, frogs, and a range of other species [31]. In recent years, a broad family of synthetic compounds known as peptoids [32] has emerged and many of these have both amphiphilic and antimicrobial properties [33,34,35,36,37]. The amphiphiles that disrupt or enhance the permeability of membranes [38,39,40] are often effective antimicrobials and typically exhibit a low rate of resistance development. As such, amphiphiles present an attractive target for antimicrobial drug development. Colistin (polymyxin E) [41] and daptomycin [42] were both isolated from bacteria and are good examples of natural amphiphilic antimicrobials.\nHydraphiles are amphiphiles that possess linked crown ether rings and are terminated by a variety of sidearms. They may be represented using the shorthand H<N18N>H for diaza-18-crown-6 as R1<N18N>R<N18N>R<N18N>R1. In this family, R is typically dodecylene or tetradecylene and R1 is benzyl. Many hydraphiles function as unimolecular ion channels [43]. These synthetic ionophores function as antibiotic adjuvants against multidrug resistant bacteria [44]. This is accomplished by penetration of the amphiphile into the bacterium, partially disrupting membrane permeability and inhibiting the efflux pump function [45]. The hydraphiles perform these functions effectively at no more than half their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) [46].\nA simpler family of biologically active dialkylmacrocycles is known as lariat ethers (LEs). These diazacrown ether derivatives are non-peptidic synthetic amphiphiles. Lariat ethers were originally developed to have donor-rich sidearms that could help to envelop a cation bound within the macrocycle. This broad family of three-dimensional binders has been studied extensively for their ability to bind and transport cations [47]. The compounds that are the subject of this report are lariat ethers having alkyl sidearms that lack donor groups. Generally, they are N,N\u2032-di-n-alkyl-4,13-diaza-18-crown-6 compounds, which may be represented schematically as R<N18N>R or Cn<N18N>Cn where \u201cn\u201d is the number of carbons in a linear alkyl sidearm. Some of these dialkyldiaza lariat ethers have been assayed and shown to possess antimicrobial properties [48].\nThe lariat ethers that contain sidearm donors function as carriers. The dialkyl lariat ethers do so as well [49], but several compounds in the dialkyl lariat ether family form cation conducting channels [45] and have significant biological activity. When co-administered with FDA-approved antimicrobial drugs, C8LE [C8H17<N18N>C8H17] and C11LE [C11H23<N18N>C11H23] sidearmed lariat ethers increased the potencies of antibiotics against drug-sensitive Escherichia coli. For example, rifampicin was 20-fold more potent against E. coli when administered with \u00bd MIC of C8LE (7).\nBased on the above observations and previously obtained results, we hypothesized that the lariat ethers\u2014dialkyl sidearmed macrocycles\u2014form aggregates within the boundary membranes of bacteria. If this hypothesis is correct, membrane permeability will be enhanced and ion homeostasis should be affected. Increased permeability could enhance drug penetration and disruption of ion homeostasis would encumber any ion-regulated cellular defense response.\nIt was found previously that within the R<N18N>R family, where R was n-alkyl having an even number of carbons, that C10LE (C10<N18N>C10) was the most efficient sodium transporter through liposomal membranes, followed by C12 and C8LEs [48]. Further, only C10 (1\u20133) and C12LEs (4\u20136) showed significant activity against Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. Of these, just C10LE (1) was active against Gram-negative K12 E. coli. The LE having n-undecyl side chains also proved active, albeit somewhat less so than C10LE. We therefore explored the ability of C10 and C12 lariat ethers to function as adjuvants to recover the potency of norfloxacin against resistant Staphylococcus aureus 1199B bacteria. S. aureus 1199B is a Gram-positive bacterium that overexpresses the NorA efflux pump [50]. This protein exports norfloxacin by a mechanism involving a Na+ antiport. Hence, the disruption of either the membrane or the regulated cation gradient, or both, should diminish a resistance response and enhance antimicrobial potency.\nIn an effort to increase both the stability and solubility of C10 and C12 LEs, we prepared the corresponding hydrochloride and methyl iodide salts. The salts were tested for enhanced solubility compared to the free bases. The combination of higher solubility and positive charges was expected to increase antimicrobial potency. Positively charged amphiphiles should have a higher affinity for the negative lipopolysaccharide bacterial surface than do the corresponding neutral compounds.\nBoth hydrochloride and methiodide salts of LEs would affect the charge state of the macro ring. A difference between them is that protonation is reversible. In vitro, protonation and re-protonation is likely because the pKa values for the macro ring nitrogen atoms in di-n-butyl-diaza-18-crown-6 are pK1 = 9.40, pK2 7.97. Protonation and re-protonation of the ring nitrogen atoms would permit the sidearm orientations to vary. In principle, this would permit the sidearms to adapt conformationally to different steric constraints. In contrast, the positive charges in the methiodide salts are permanent. In either case, the positive charges will diminish the cation complexing ability of the macrocycle. In the cases of the methiodide salts, the two methyl groups could also add a steric impediment to cation binding. We describe herein the results of studies that attempt to determine the import of protonation and methylation on bacterial growth inhibition and/or antimicrobial potency recovery.\n\n## 2.1. The Compounds and Organisms\nFigure 1 shows the chemical structures and preparation of the compounds that were used in the study. 4,13-Diaza-18-crown-6 was alkylated and reduced or the sidearms were attached by reductive amination. The bacterium we call E. coli tetR was prepared in our laboratory and has a MIC against tetracycline of 1000 \u00b5M [51].\nDerivatization of 4,13-diaza-18-crown-6 was accomplished either by forming the bis(amide) and reducing it or by reductive amination, both illustrated in Figure 1. The hydrochloride salts were formed by treatment with HCl in dioxane. Reaction of the LEs with CH3I in diethyl ether or toluene afforded the bis(methiodide) salts. The compounds illustrated in Figure 1 are C10LE (1, n = 10), C10LE\u20222HCl (2), C10LE\u20222MeI (3), C12LE (4, n = 12), C12LE\u20222HCl (5), and C12LE\u20222MeI (6).\n\n## 2.2. Lariat Ethers and Derivatives\u2019 Activities against E. coli DH5\u03b1\nThe MIC data shown in Table 1 are for C8 to C14LE derivatives against the non-pathogenic DH5\u03b1 strain of E. coli in the absence of any additional antimicrobial agent. The MICs shown in the table are artificially limited to 128 \u00b5M. Higher concentrations than this can be measured, but at such low potencies for bacteriostatic action, we deem the amphiphile to be inactive. Thus, C8LE (7) was only marginally active against K12 E. coli (MIC = 100 \u00b5M) and it was even less active (MIC = 206 \u00b5M) against the DH5\u03b1 strain (data not in Table 1). In general, the MIC results were in concert with earlier reports. Table 1 shows previously reported data for the potencies of lariat ethers having n-octyl, n-undecyl, and n-tetradecyl side chains [48]. Additional data are for lariat ether hydrochlorides and lariat ether methiodides against DH5\u03b1 E. coli. Since we considered MICs higher than 128 \u00b5M as inactive, any MIC higher than that value is reported as 128 \u00b5M irrespective of the actual value. C11LE free base is included for comparison in the table, but the protonated and methylated forms were not studied.\nAn earlier potency study [48] of an N,N\u2032-di-n-alkyl-4,13-diaza-18-crown-6 family of analogs having sidearms of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 carbons was conducted against E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, activity against DH5\u03b1 E. coli was observed only with C10LE (1). C10LE (1) and C12LE (4) were active against Gram-positive B. subtilis and S. cerevisiae, but C12LE (4) was not active against E. coli. The E. coli data shown in Table 1 are consistent with these published results. Remarkably, C12LE\u20222MeI (6) is active against E. coli, but the dihydrochloride C12LE\u20222HCl (5) is not. The surprising contrast in biological responses of these closely related compounds engendered a study of the physical chemical variables that might account for the differences.\n\n## 2.3. Solubility of Lariat Ethers and Salts\nWater solubility is required for a drug to circulate in the bloodstream. Acidic or basic drugs are often converted into salts in the administering formulation to enhance solubility [52]. The present results relate to bacterial cells rather than infection in a complex organism. The solubilities of lariat ethers 1\u20136 were determined in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Mueller Hinton II broth [53] (MHII includes protein, starch, Mg2+, and Ca2+, at pH 7.3, purchased from Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA) media [54] at concentrations from 1 \u00b5M to 128 \u00b5M. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 25.6 mM and serially diluted by 2-fold to a minimum concentration of 200 nM. The compound was added to a microdilution containing either MHII media or PBS such that the final concentration of DMSO was \u22640.5% [55]. The absorbance of the whole plate was determined at 540 nm after 2 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. Any absorbance greater than that of the average blank plus three times its standard deviation was considered to be turbidity resulting from insoluble matter. The average solubility results from three replicates in each case are shown in Table 2. Verapamil hydrochloride and reserpine were used as high- and low-solubility controls, respectively.\nAs expected from published data [56], verapamil hydrochloride was soluble in water as well as in media, while reserpine was soluble only at 16 \u00b5M in both PBS and MHII. We surveyed both the HCl and MeI salts of C10LE (1) and C12LE (4). As shown in Table 2, the methyl iodide (MeI) salts of C10 and C12 lariat ethers showed greater solubility in PBS than do the corresponding HCl salts. The free base form of C10LE (1), was more soluble in both PBS and MHII than was C12LE (4). This was expected, since C10LE (1) contains four fewer carbons than C12LE (4). It is interesting to note that the solubilities of methiodide salts 3 and 6 were greater in PBS than in MHII. Although MHII is a more complex medium than phosphate-buffered saline, the solubilities showed a similar profile except for C12LE\u20222MeI (6). Figure 2 shows the data of Table 2 in graphical form.\nThe difference in solubilities between C10LE\u20222MeI (3) and C12LE\u20222MeI (6) in MH II media was surprising, but reproducible. We speculate that the explanation lies in a difference in sidearm orientations. The solid state structure for a sodium complex of C12LE (4) has been reported [57]. In it, the side chains are parallel and in contact in the crystal. To our knowledge, no structure is available for a lariat ether hydrochloride or methiodide salt. We have been unsuccessful in obtaining crystals of either. It seems reasonable to think that the sidearms in the bis(methiodide) are on opposite sides of the macrocycle, which would relieve strain engendered by the methyl groups attached to the macro ring. If the sidearms were aligned in C10LE (1) and splayed in C12LE (4), the former\u2019s more concentrated hydrophobic surface could reduce its solubility compared to splayed sidearms. Of course, this difference is manifested only in MHII and not in PBS media.\nThe macro ring portion of lariat ethers can bind various cations, albeit with modest affinity in aqueous solution. In the presence of Na+, K+, or Ca2+, the LE free base compounds form salt complexes that are polar and more soluble than the neutral precursors. As a result, their solubilities as complexes are \u2265128 \u00b5M, the limit of the measurements made. The binding of either C10LE (1) or C12LE (4) salts will be diminished whether hydrochlorides or methiodides owing to the positive charges in the macro ring. The charge state of the hydrochloride salt will depend on pH, but the positive charges in 2, 3, 5, and 6 should increase their affinities for the negative bacterial surface. The lariat ethers may also exhibit affinity towards proteins (non-specific binding).\nAn additional solubility property is evaluated as the partition coefficient between water and n-octanol. Figure 3 shows calculated log P values for the C8-C14 lariats and their salts. The data were calculated using the log P partitioning software in the ChemAxon Marvin Sketch program. As expected, the graph shows linear increases in log P as the number of carbons in the sidearms increased. Of course, these calculations reflect a neutral water/n-octanol system and not media-containing cations, sugars, protein, or buffers. The perfect linearity results from the computational model rather than experiment.\nThe difference in the solubilities of C10LE\u20222MeI (3) and C12LE\u20222MeI (6) observed experimentally (Figure 2) was unexpected. The solubilities of the various lariat ethers seem to be similar or identical in the two media except for C12LE\u20222MeI (6). It is tempting to suggest that because Mueller Hinton broth contains such elements as beef extract and starch, differences might be expected compared to phosphate-buffered saline. If an interaction occurs with the lariat ether methiodides, it should be manifested by both C10LE\u20222MeI (3) and C12LE\u20222MeI (6). Although the effect was less dramatic for C10LE\u20222MeI (3) than for C12LE\u20222MeI (6), 3 and 6 were the only compounds in this series to show such a deviation. It seems likely that the organic elements of the MH broth as well as sidearm disposition (see above) played a role in the difference, but such an explanation remains speculative.\n\n## 2.4. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Studies\nMICs were determined [46] for LEs and antibiotics against E. coli K12, S. aureus 1199B, and tetR\u00a0E. coli. The K12 strain was benign, but more clinically relevant than DH5\u03b1. The strain of E. coli designated tetR was developed in our laboratory and incorporates the tetracycline efflux pump [50]. The results are shown in Table 3 below. The MICs of norfloxacin and tetracycline were high as expected because they were determined against resistant strains of bacteria. The MICs of C10LE (1) and C12LE (4) against E. coli were similar to the previously reported values. Note that the lariat ether free bases having n-octyl, n-tetradecyl, or n-hexadecyl sidearms all showed no activity against K12 E. coli at concentrations lower than 128 \u00b5M.\nCompounds 1\u20136 were all more active against Gram-positive S. aureus than Gram-negative E. coli. The MICs of C10LE (1) and C10LE\u20222HCl (2) were similar against the three bacterial strains tested, although potency was slightly higher against Gram-positive S. aureus. It is interesting to note that the difference in solubility between 1 and 2 did not significantly affect the MICs, which ranged only from 2\u201310 \u00b5M. The MIC of C12LE (4) against S. aureus (32 \u00b5M) was several times higher (less potent) than that of C10LE (1). This comports with the sodium release data previously published: 4 was a less active ion transporter in a membrane than compound 1 [48]. The antimicrobial activities of the HCl and MeI salts of C12LE (5 and 6) against S. aureus were greater than those of the free bases. C12LE\u20222MeI (6) showed the greatest potency (MIC = 1 \u00b5M) against S. aureus. Against Gram-negative tetR\u00a0E. coli, C12LE\u2022MeI, 6, was active (MIC = 16 \u00b5M), but C12LE free base 4 and methiodide 5 were inactive. Against both E. coli and S. aureus, the C10LE free base was more active than C12LE (4). The C12LE\u20222HCl (5) salt was more active than C10LE\u20222MeI (6).\nThe LEs may disrupt ion homeostasis and/or alter membrane permeability. Changes in membrane permeability may enhance antimicrobial influx. Altered permeability may also permit unregulated flow of cations into and out of the organism. To the extent the latter occurs, the function of any enzyme that requires ion regulation will be compromised. We have shown that the hydraphile relatives of LEs are potent efflux pump inhibitors [45]. It should also be noted that the presence of positive charges in 2, 3, 5, and 6 should enhance selectivity for the negative surfaces of bacteria compared to mammalian cells.\n\n## 2.5. Membrane Permeability\nMembrane permeability was assessed by using the dyes propidium iodide and alamar blue. Their structures are shown in Figure 4. Propidium iodide (PI) is a fluorescent dye that normally does not penetrate intact biological membranes. However, when PI does enter a cell, it intercalates within the DNA structure. Intercalation of PI does not appear to favor any particular nucleobase sequence. When intercalation occurs, a strong fluorescent emission can be detected. Alamar blue, based on resazurin, is a nontoxic weakly fluorescent dye that is sensitive to reduction potential within vital cells. When reduced, it is converted into highly fluorescent resorufin (7-hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one). The reduction occurs during respiration in vital cells; formation of highly fluorescent resorufin demonstrates active metabolism and therefore cellular vitality.\nThe combination of alamar blue and propidium iodide allowed us to assess the membrane permeability of S. aureus while confirming cellular vitality. Results of the PI/alamar blue studies with S. aureus are summarized in the graph of Figure 5. When S. aureus (1199B) was exposed to the two dyes, penetration of PI was relatively low and cellular vitality remained high. Compounds 1\u20136, were administered at \u00bd MIC, at which concentrations toxicity was not expected (see growth curves below in Figure 6). In general, cellular penetration and vitality correlated. The obvious exception was C12LE\u2022MeI (6), which showed a level of PI penetration similar to that observed for S. aureus alone. The latter is a particularly interesting observation because 6 showed the highest potency against S. aureus, matched only by C10LE\u2022MeI (3), which did show good penetration. These results suggest that potency cannot be explained solely by altered membrane permeability.\nAnother potential variable in the assessment of potencies of 1\u20136 against S. aureus is the environment in which the study is conducted. It is clear, for example, that the conversion of 1 \u2192 2 and 4 \u2192 5 will be favored at lower pH. Modest changes in pH are unlikely to alter the MIC values for methiodides 3 and 6. Indeed, changes in MIC were observed for 1, 2, 4, and 5 as the pH was increased from 6.4 to 8.4, while the MICs for 3 and 6 were unchanged. These studies were conducted in Mueller Hinton (MH) microbiological growth medium. Both MH versions are more complex media than phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). MH typically contains beef extract, casein hydrolysate, starch, and water. Once the components are mixed, the pH is adjusted to neutral. MHII, used here, also contains Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. The results are shown in Table 4.\n\n## 2.6. Growth Curves\nIn the studies above, 1\u20136 were administered at \u00bd MIC concentrations. At these concentrations, no toxic effect of the compound on cells was anticipated. In order to confirm the effect of compound concentration on S. aureus viability, growth curves were conducted for each compound. In all cases, S. aureus alone was used as control. For the three C10LE compounds (1\u20133), 32 \u00b5M and 64 \u00b5M concentrations of norfloxacin were added to the norfloxacin-resistant S. aureus strain as an additional control. The concentration ranges for each of compounds 1\u20136 varied with their potencies.\nIn all cases, bacterial growth was unaffected at \u00bd MIC concentrations of the lariat ether or lariat ether derivative. In general, the data show that against S. aureus 1199B, which is norfloxacin-resistant, there was little response to low concentrations of the LEs. The single exception is C12LE (4). While the MIC against this bacterium was 32 \u03bcM, growth effects were observed at \u00bd MIC and lower. This was the only LE among the six shown for which such behavior was observed. It is especially surprising because the behavior of C10LE (1) and C12LE (4) usually correlate. At present, the reason for this apparent anomaly is unclear.\n\n## 2.7. Combination Studies\nThe focus on bacterial growth at \u00bd MIC of 1\u20136 derives from the potential of these compounds to function as adjuvants. In combination with a known drug, an adjuvant has the potential to enhance its potency. In some cases, the adjuvant may thwart a resistance mechanism. An example is the combination antibiotic Augmentin\u00ae, which combines amoxicillin with clavulanic acid: the latter component inhibits degradation of the penicillin by \u03b2-lactamase enzymes. Recent studies have shown that colistin, a membrane penetrating antibiotic, can be used with a potency increasing adjuvant [58].\nEach of the checkerboard analyses shown in Figure 7 combines one of 1\u20136 with norfloxacin. S. aureus 1199B is resistant to norfloxacin. By combining varying concentrations of both norfloxacin and a lariat ether or lariat ether derivative, potency enhancement, if any, can be determined. In the graphs (checkerboards) shown, the potency of each concentration combination can be assessed visually. The darkest shades in each graph correspond to the least potent combinations. The absence of color shows 90% or greater efficacy of the adjuvant with norfloxacin against the norfloxacin-resistant organism.\nAn example is the combination of C10LE (1) and norfloxacin, as shown in the upper left panel of Figure 7. S. aureus was resistant to norfloxacin at up to 32 \u00b5M, but succumbed at 64 \u00b5M. However, when 1 is co-administered at 2 \u00b5M, only 0.5 \u00b5M norfloxacin was required to effect 90% growth inhibition. This was a 128-fold increase in the potency of norfloxacin against this resistant organism.\nIn the figure above, the MICs for norfloxacin and the LEs are highlighted. Where two values are highlighted, the MIC lies between the two, leading to a range of potentiation values. In all cases, however, the enhancement of potency was significant for compounds 1\u20136, regardless of charge or alkylation.\n\n## 2.8. Complexation of Antimicrobials by Lariat Ethers\nWe recently reported [59] that the presence of C10LE enhanced the penetration of tetracycline hydrochloride in a model membrane system. Evidence for an interaction between the macrocycle and antimicrobial salt was obtained by showing that dichloromethane insoluble tetracycline hydrochloride dissolved on a 1:1 basis with the lariat ether. The dissolution was observed visually in CH2Cl2 solution and quantitated by NMR analysis in CD2Cl2. In the visualization experiment, the insolubility of the antimicrobial salt was demonstrated in either CH2Cl2 or CHCl3 (with identical results). The solubility of the lariat ether alone was likewise confirmed. A combination of the lariat ether, the antimicrobial salt, and solvent were mixed. Dissolution of the salt provided visual confirmation of the complexation, presumably by a supramolecular interaction. In the NMR experiments, excess salt was used and the solution filtered before obtaining the spectrum. Figure 8 shows the structures of the five tetracycline derivatives studied.\nThe complexation studies were undertaken in several ways. In previous work [60], we showed by neutron reflectance that the presence of C10LE enhanced the penetration of tetracycline in a model membrane. In order to obtain additional information about tetracycline\u2019s behavior, we attempted to dissolve its hydrochloride salt in CH2Cl2 to no avail. The solvent was chosen because its dielectric constant mimicked that of n-octanol, a common membrane model. C10LE was freely soluble in CH2Cl2. A solution of C10LE was exposed to powdered tetracycline hydrochloride, mixed, and filtered. A clear, but slightly yellow solution was obtained showing that the drug had fully dissolved.\nIn order to quantitate the dissolution/complexation phenomenon, a similar procedure was conducted using either CD2Cl2 or CDCl3 and the complex stoichiometry was determined by evaluating NMR integrals. Each NMR experiment was conducted at least in triplicate. A representative stack plot is shown for minocycline hydrochloride in Figure 9. An effort to obtain additional complexation data by using infrared techniques was unsuccessful.\nSimilar NMR experiments were conducted with the tetracycline series of compounds. The results are recorded in Table 5.\nAn examination of the numerous NMR experiments showed that the most prominent changes in the spectra occurred in the signals proximate to the macro ring nitrogen atoms. The inference drawn from this was that hydrogen bonding facilitated by tetracycline\u2019s hydrochloride was providing a primary link between drug and crown. It should be noted that the tetracycline family of molecules, although represented in line-angle drawings as four fused linear rings, actually are bent. Figure 10 shows the structure of tetracycline hydrochloride rendered in the space-filling representation from the CCSD structure (XAYCAB) [61] using Mercury software v15.6.29.0.\nAn examination of various types of molecular models suggested the contacts illustrated in Figure 11. The top panel shows the association using framework models. An attempt was made to illustrate the postulated complex using CPK space-filling models, but the possible bonding pattern was obscure in this representation. The suggested arrangement is shown in wireframe models and the line-angle drawing in the lower panel of Figure 11. The two presumed hydrogen bonds are shown in the drawing by using purple hydrogen atoms. The two hydrogen bonds are donated from tetracycline to the macrocycle. The protonated dimethylamino group at position 4 in the A ring of tetracycline donates to one macro ring nitrogen atom and the phenolic hydroxyl at position 10 in the D ring provides the other hydrogen.\nThe lack of any complexation interaction between C10LE (1) and chlortetracycline was surprising. The explanation did not seem to lie in a difference in pKa values or significant changes in polarity compared to tetracycline. However, an examination of models suggested that the chlorine in the 7-position of the D ring presented a steric impediment to the macrocycle accessing the phenolic hydroxyl in the D-ring. The alternate hydroxy groups are either tertiary and hindered (positions 6 and 12a) or enolic and part of a \u03b2-diketone system (position 12, see Figure 8).\nAs expected, tetracycline hydrochloride was freely soluble in water whereas C10LE (1) is only slightly soluble. In an inversion of the experiments described above, the water-insoluble diazacrown was drawn into aqueous solution on a 1:1 basis. Because of water\u2019s solvating power and the inferred stabilization of the complex by H-bonding, this result was unexpected. As in the other complexation studies, the result was confirmed in triplicate. Quantitation was obtained by NMR studies conducted in D2O.\n\n## 2.9. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)\nIt is known that dialkyldiazacrowns form stable aggregates in aqueous solution [57,62]. It was hypothesized that complexation between antimicrobials and macrocycles would alter or prevent the ability of the complex to form aggregates. The graph of Figure 12 shows the results of dynamic light scattering for C12LE (4) in water along with the combinations of the crown and the five tetracycline derivatives. Of the five tetracyclines studied, only chlortetracycline hydrochloride failed to complex with C12LE (4). The graph clearly shows that aggregation was completely impeded by all of the tetracyclines except for chlortetracycline hydrochloride. Indeed, the particle sizes observed when chlortetracycline is present was almost indistinguishable from particle formation by C12LE (4) alone.\nThe studies described for the tetracycline family were extended to a number of antimicrobials. The group included ampicillin, penicillin G, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and kanamycin. This group does not comprise an analogous series as was possible with the group of tetracycline derivatives. Further, the tetracycline derivatives were all hydrochloride salts. In the present group, the structures of which are shown in Figure 13, only ciprofloxacin was obtained as the hydrochloride salt. The other compounds were examined in the forms available as commercial pharmaceuticals. Ampicillin was used as the trihydrate, ",
