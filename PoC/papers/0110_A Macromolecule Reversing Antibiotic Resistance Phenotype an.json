  "full_text": "## Introduction\nThe antibiotic development pipeline has run dry since the 1980s with few new antibiotics being approved for clinical use.[\n\n1\n\n] Particularly, there is a serious lack of effective treatment options for drug\u2010resistant Gram\u2010negative bacterial infections. Carbapenem\u2010resistant Gram\u2010negative bacteria, including Acinetobacter baumannii, have been identified as the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s critical priority pathogens for development of new treatment approaches.[\n\n1\n\n] The surge of antibiotic resistance accompanied with the dearth of new antibiotics has made drug\u2010resistant bacterial infections a serious global threat,[\n\n2\n\n] potentially claiming an estimated 10 million lives in 2050.[\n\n3\n\n] To treat multidrug\u2010resistant (MDR) bacterial infections (especially Gram\u2010negative bacteria), the monotherapy of current antibiotics may no longer be adequate. Even for polymyxin antibiotics (polymyxin B and colistin), the last\u2010resort treatment for MDR Gram\u2010negative bacterial infections, resistance to them has been increasingly found in clinical isolates.[\n\n4\n\n] As an alternative approach, combination therapy has attracted great attention. Although both positive and negative clinical outcomes were reported from the combination of different antibiotics for treatment of Gram\u2010negative bacterial infections,[\n\n5\n\n] combining antibiotics with non\u2010antibiotic adjuvants has seen success in overcoming resistance against \u03b2\u2010lactams (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and meropenem/aspergillomarasmine A).[\n\n6\n\n] In addition, antibiotic combinations with a food additive (vanillin/spectinomycin), with a membrane disruptor (colistin/macrolides), or a non\u2010antibiotic drug (procaine/doxycycline) were recently reported to afford a synergistic effect against MDR Gram\u2010negative bacteria.[\n\n7\n\n] Colistin/macrolide combinations were active even at low concentrations in colistin\u2010resistant bacteria, although the precise mechanism underlying the synergistic effect is unclear.[\n\n7\n\n] Among the adjuvants reported in the literature, membrane\u2010disruptive antimicrobials such as colistin have been extensively explored to potentiate antibiotic activity.[\n\n7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n\n] Despite this success, it is not advisable to use this last\u2010resort drug against MDR Gram\u2010negative bacteria as an antibiotic adjuvant as it may increase the incidence of colistin resistance.[\n\n4\n\n] Moreover, no difference in clinical response rates between treatments with colistin and colistin/antibiotic combinations was observed for MDR Gram\u2010negative bacterial infections,[\n\n11\n, \n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n, \n15\n\n] and nephrotoxicity was increased with the combination therapy.[\n\n12\n\n] Apart from colistin, several cationic antimicrobial polymers were also utilized as adjuvants to enhance antibacterial activity of antibiotics.[\n\n16\n, \n17\n, \n18\n\n] Like colistin, these cationic polymers killed bacteria by membrane disruption. Therefore, they may face similar challenges as colistin/antibiotic combination has. Hence, antibiotic adjuvants with the ability to reverse antibiotic resistance phenotype enhance antibiotic potency and repurpose drugs as potent antibiotics are greatly needed.\nPolycarbonates are biodegradable polymers that have been studied for biomedical applications such as drug/gene delivery[\n\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n, \n26\n, \n27\n\n] and antimicrobial materials[\n\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n\n] due to their good biocompatibility and ease of incorporating various functional groups. Recently, we reported broad\u2010spectrum antimicrobial guanidinium\u2010functionalized polycarbonates with unique mechanism: membrane translocation followed by precipitation of cytosolic materials.[\n\n31\n\n] Multiple treatments with the polymer neither increased their effective dose nor upregulated expression of genes associated with resistance as evidenced by RNA sequencing. Given the distinctive mechanism of the guanidinium\u2010based polycarbonate, we hypothesized that it could provide unique opportunities to reverse antibiotic resistance phenotype and enhance antimicrobial potency of the antibiotic as it could block the activity of antibiotic\u2010modifying genes or proteins and thereby increase the therapeutic effectiveness of the antibiotic in MDR infections (Figure\u00a0\n1a).\n\n## Macromolecule Reverses Antibiotic Resistance Phenotype\nWe evaluated the potential of the guanidinium\u2010functionalized polycarbonate pEt_20 with degree of polymerization (DP) of 20 (Scheme S1, Supporting Information) to sensitize MDR bacteria to antibiotics having different antimicrobial mechanisms of action. In the MDR A. baumannii strain (BAA\u20101789), which is resistant to all antibiotics tested (Figure\u00a01b), the polymer mitigated the resistance against azithromycin, gentamicin, imipenem and tetracycline, and reduced their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to the susceptible level or even lower than the susceptible level (Figure\u00a01b,c). The sensitization effect of the polymer was also reflected by reduction in the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the antibiotics (128\u2010, 32\u2010, 8\u2010, and 16\u2010fold reduction for azithromycin, gentamicin, imipenem, and tetracycline, respectively) (Figure\u00a01b,d), where the polymer was used at 0.5\u00d7 MIC (7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121), which did not lead to a significant bactericidal effect (\u22480% killing efficiency as compared to CFU at 0 h). These antibiotics kill bacteria by either inhibiting cell wall synthesis through interacting with penicillin binding proteins (imipenem) or preventing protein synthesis through binding 50S (azithromycin) or 30S subunit (tetracycline and gentamicin) of the ribosome. Imipenem resistance is mainly caused by carbapenemases that degrade \u03b2\u2010lactam,[\n\n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n\n] azithromycin resistance by methylase that alters the ribosomal target,[\n\n35\n\n] tetracycline resistance by overexpression of ribosomal protection proteins that remove tetracycline from the ribosome,[\n\n36\n\n] and gentamicin resistance by aminoglycoside\u2010modifying enzymes.[\n\n37\n, \n38\n\n] A possible reason for reversal of antibiotic resistance phenotype and sensitization of the MDR bacteria toward antibiotic treatment is the polymer's ability in nonspecific binding to cytosolic enzymes (proteins) or genes, including those that are responsible for antibiotic resistance.\nImportantly, the polymer is capable of potentiating last\u2010line antibiotic colistin activity and reversing colistin\u2010resistance phenotype. Recently, plasmid\u2010mediated colistin\u2010resistance was reported in Gram\u2010negative bacteria, which resulted from MCR\u20101 enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A, rendering the membrane more electropositive.[\n\n39\n, \n40\n\n] The MIC of colistin (colistimethate sodium) against two MCR\u20101\u2010positive Escherichia coli strains was determined to be 15.6 and 31.3\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information), higher than the breakpoints of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard for susceptibility testing (4\u20138\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 for Gram\u2010negative bacteria). The polymer at 0.5\u00d7 MIC (7.81\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121) significantly lowered colistimethate sodium MIC from 15.6\u201331.3 to 0.49\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 (32\u2010 and 64\u2010fold reduction, respectively). More importantly, the MBC of colistimethate sodium was reduced by eightfold from 15.6 and 31.3\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 to 1.95 and 3.91\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121, respectively, in the presence of the polymer where the polymer did not have a significant bactericidal effect (\u22480% killing efficiency as compared to CFU at 0 h). The results demonstrate that the polymer sensitized the MCR\u20101 colistin\u2010resistant bacteria to colistin treatment.\n\n## Macromolecule Repurposes Drugs\nThe polymer repurposed both the antituberculosis drug rifampicin and the antirheumatic drug auranofin, which are less effective against Gram\u2010negative bacteria than Gram\u2010positive bacteria (MIC of rifampicin: 1.95\u201331.3\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 against Gram\u2010negative bacteria vs <\u00a00.031\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 for Gram\u2010positive Staphylococcus aureus; MIC of auranofin: 15.6\u201362.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 against Gram\u2010negative bacteria vs 0.06\u20130.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 for S. aureus\n[\n\n41\n, \n42\n\n]), as antibiotics with strong potency against Gram\u2010negative A. baumannii BAA\u20101709 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Rifampicin acts by binding the \u03b2 subunit of RNA polymerase, thus inhibiting RNA synthesis,[\n\n43\n\n] whereas auranofin inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which disrupts thiol\u2010redox (Trx\u2010TrxR) balance essential in Gram\u2010positive bacteria as they lack the redox couple glutathione (GSH) and GSH reductase (GR), thus compromising defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS).[\n\n42\n\n] However, GSH\u2010GR exists in many Gram\u2010negative bacteria, and thus Trx\u2010TrxR balance is not critical as evidenced by the high MIC values against Gram\u2010negative bacteria. In combination with the polymer, both rifampicin and auranofin showed for the first time a high level of activity against Gram\u2010negative bacteria. MICs of rifampicin and auranofin were reduced by 2048\u2010 and 128\u2010fold, respectively, against A. baumannii in combination with the polymer at 7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 (0.5\u00d7 MIC) (Figure S1a,b, Supporting Information). Moreover, pEt_20 at 7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121, where pEt_20 alone did not kill the bacteria (\u22480% killing efficiency as compared to CFU at 0 h), significantly enhanced bactericidal activity of the drugs, and MBCs of rifampicin and auranofin were reduced from 3.91 and 15.6\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 to 0.015 (256\u2010fold reduction for rifampicin) and 0.244\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 (64\u2010fold reduction for auranofin) against A. baumannii (BAA\u20101709), respectively (Figure S1b,c, Supporting Information).\nMoreover, the polymer/rifampicin and polymer/auranofin combinations showed strong potency against MDR A. baumannii (Figure\u00a0\n2\n), where MIC dropped by 512\u2010fold for both rifampicin and auranofin in the presence of pEt_20 at 7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 (0.5\u00d7 MIC) (Figure\u00a02a,b). The polymer reduced MBC of rifampicin and auranofin by 256\u2010 and 128\u2010fold, respectively (Figure\u00a02a,c\u2013e). A similar phenomenon was also seen for the polymer/rifampicin combination at a polymer concentration of 0.5\u00d7 MIC in other types of Gram\u2010negative bacteria, including Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae, and other A. baumannii strains, with MIC reduction between 256\u2010 and 2048\u2010fold (Figure\u00a0\n3a). In addition, the polymer at 0.5\u00d7 MIC, where no bactericidal activity was observed (\u22480% killing efficiency as compared to CFU at 0 h), reduced the MBC of rifampicin by 128\u2010 to 512\u2010fold (Figure\u00a03a,b). Moreover, the polymer at 0.5\u00d7 MIC reduced MIC of rifampicin derivatives (rifaximin and rifabutin) by 512\u2010fold against A. baumannii (BAA\u20101709) (Table S2, Supporting Information). We postulate that binding of the polymer with cytosolic genes or proteins is in part responsible for its ability of potentiating the antimicrobial activity of rifampicin and its derivatives. In the mechanistic study presented later, we demonstrated that polymer treatment increased intracellular ROS of the bacteria. Hence, removal of bacterial defense by auranofin against ROS can explain for the enhanced killing of the bacteria.\n\n## Stark Difference between Membrane Translocation and Membrane Lytic Macromolecules\nAlthough the use of colistin (colistin sulfate) and quaternary ammonium\u2010based polycarbonate (Qua_20, Scheme S1, Supporting Information),[\n\n44\n\n] which kill bacteria by membrane disruption, reduced rifampicin MIC, guanidinium\u2010based polycarbonates (pEt_10, pEt_20, and pEt_40, with DP of 10, 20, and 40, respectively) (Scheme S1, Supporting Information) potentiated rifampicin more effectively, reducing rifampicin MIC by 2048\u2010 to 4096\u2010fold at a polymer concentration of 0.5\u00d7 MIC against A. baumannii (BAA\u20101709) as compared to 16\u2010, 4\u2010, and 4\u2010fold reduction for colistin sulfate, Qua_20 and polyarginine (R10), respectively (Table S3, Supporting Information). The presence of the polymers with different lengths led to similar MIC of rifampicin, and the difference in the MIC is \u22642 times. This is considered no significant difference as MIC was measured by the commonly used twofold serial dilution method.[\n\n31\n\n] Therefore, the molecular weight of the polymer did not affect the antibacterial activity of rifampicin. In addition, pEt_20 potentiated auranofin more effectively than colistin sulfate with greater MIC and MBC fold reduction: 128\u2010 versus 8\u2010fold MIC reduction and 64\u2010 versus 2\u2010fold MBC reduction for the drug\u2010susceptible A. baumannii (BAA\u20101709) (Figure S1, Supporting Information), 512\u2010 versus 256\u2010fold MIC reduction and 128\u2010 versus 32\u2010fold MBC reduction for MDR A. baumannii (BAA\u20101789) (Figure\u00a02). In the presence of pEt_20, a lower concentration of rifampicin (Figure\u00a02d and Figure S1d, Supporting Information) or auranofin (Figure\u00a02e and Figure S1e, Supporting Information) was required to kill the same number of MDR A. baumannii (BAA\u20101789) or A. baumannii (BAA\u20101709) as compared to colistin sulfate, which is a typical membrane\u2010lytic antibiotic. Moreover, the polymer was more effective than colistin sulfate in reducing MIC and MBC of azithromycin against both strains: 8\u2010 versus 2\u2010fold MIC reduction and 16\u2010 versus 4\u2010fold MBC reduction for the drug\u2010susceptible strain (Figure S2, Supporting Information), 256\u2010 versus 16\u2010fold MIC reduction (Figure\u00a01b) and 128\u2010 versus 4\u2010fold MBC reduction for the MDR strain (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The overall superiority of the polymer/antibiotic combination over colistin sulfate/antibiotic combination was further demonstrated by faster killing efficiency. With colistin sulfate, a longer duration of time is required to kill a similar number of bacteria (Figure S3, Supporting Information).\n\n## Macromolecule Reverses Rifampicin Resistance Phenotype in Mutants\nTo further study if the use of the macromolecule is able to reverse antibiotic resistance, rifampicin\u2010resistant A. baumannii mutants were developed by inoculating 108 CFUs on an agar plate containing different lethal concentrations of rifampicin (MBC, 2\u00d7 MBC and 5\u00d7 MBC) (Figure\u00a0\n4a). A number of A. baumannii mutants were developed after 3 days of incubation even at 5\u00d7 MBC, and MIC of rifampicin increased from 3.9 to 125\u2013500\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 against the mutants. Whole genome sequencing of the evolved strains at the three concentrations (three colonies for every concentration) was performed. All nine isolates independently acquired mutations in the rpoB gene, and no other mutation was observed relative to control strains that were subjected to the same assay conditions except for antibiotic treatment. Mutations in rpoB were reported with A. baumannii clinical isolates, which led to high MICs (\u2248256\u2013512\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121),[\n\n45\n\n] similar to what we observed with our in vitro evolved rifampicin\u2010resistant colonies. In sharp contrast, no resistant colonies to the polymer were found on the plates even when the inoculum increased from 108 to 109 CFUs, implying that the frequency of resistance to the polymer was less than 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210. More importantly, the polymer reversed the rifampicin resistance phenotype of the mutants, reducing MIC of rifampicin to 0.00098\u20130.122\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 (up to 2.5 \u00d7 105\u2010fold reduction) (Figure\u00a04a). In addition, pEt_20 at 0.5\u00d7 MIC, where there was no significant bactericidal effect (\u22480% killing efficiency as compared to CFU at 0 h), decreased the MBC of rifampicin from 500 to 0.122\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 (4096\u2010fold reduction) against one of the mutants developed with rifampicin at 2\u00d7 MBC (Figure\u00a04b), which is even lower than rifampicin MBC against the parent strain (3.9\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121) (Figure\u00a03a), further demonstrating its ability of reversing rifampicin resistance phenotype. Although colistin sulfate also reduced rifampicin MIC and MBC in the mutants (Figure\u00a04b), it is 256\u2010fold (MIC) and 64\u2010fold (MBC) less effective than the polymer (16\u2010 vs 4096\u2010fold reduction in rifampicin MIC and \u226532\u2010 vs \u22652048\u2010fold reduction in rifampicin MBC for colistin sulfate and polymer, respectively) (Figure\u00a04b,c). It is worth noting that colistin sulfate is unable to reverse rifampicin resistance phenotype in the mutants as MIC and MBC of rifampicin against the mutants in the presence of colistin sulfate at 0.5\u00d7 MIC (i.e., 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121) were still higher than those of rifampicin against the parent strain (MIC and MBC: 31.3\u00a0vs 3.91\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121) (Figure\u00a04b,c). Moreover, polymer/rifampicin combination showed a bactericidal effect (99.9% killing efficiency) against the mutants within 4 h, while colistin sulfate/rifampicin combination did not kill the mutants within the same time frame (Figure\u00a04d). These findings demonstrate that pEt_20 reverses rifampicin resistance phenotype, and enhances the antimicrobial activity of rifampicin against the mutants much more effectively than colistin sulfate.\n\n## Mechanistic Study\nWe next explored the general antimicrobial mechanism of the polymer/antibiotic combination using polymer/rifampicin as an example. Membrane potential and permeability of A. baumannii was studied after polymer treatment at a sublethal dose that did not kill the bacteria during the experimental period of 30\u00a0min (\u22480% killing efficiency as compared to CFU at 0 h) (Figure\u00a0\n5a). Polymer treatment resulted in transient membrane depolarization. Specifically, the membrane potential was reduced upon bidendate hydrogen\u2010bonding interaction between guanidinium groups in the polymer and anionic phosphate groups on the membrane,[\n\n46\n\n] but it then increased gradually after membrane translocation of the polymer (Figure\u00a05b). Alexa\u2010Fluor\u2010488\u2010labeled polymer was seen in the membrane and cytosol of the bacterial cells after translocation (Figure S4a, Supporting Information). Contrary to membrane\u2010lytic colistin sulfate, polymer treatment caused minimal membrane disruption (Figure\u00a05c). These findings further suggest that unlike colistin sulfate, the polymer does not exert its antibacterial synergistic effect via membrane disruption or permeabilization but rather via a membrane translocation mechanism that enables its interaction with essential cytosolic biomacromolecules of the bacterial cell. As shown in Figure\u00a05d, the polymer treatment resulted in a significant increase in the amount of insoluble proteins in the bacteria as reflected by the increase of insoluble to soluble protein ratio. Additionally, pEt_20 effectively bound bacterial DNA and inhibited DNA mobility (Figure S4b, Supporting Information). We predicted that this unique mechanism of action of polymer pEt_20 would translate to an overwhelming cytosolic stress, which would mediate rapid bacterial cell death. As shown in Figure\u00a05e,f and Figures S5\u2013S7 in the Supporting Information, polymer treatment led to significant production of intracellular ROS of both drug\u2010susceptible A. baumannii BAA\u20101709 and rifampicin\u2010resistant A. baumannii BAA\u20101709 mutant (developed from 2\u00d7 MBC of rifampicin, i.e., 7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121) within a few minutes even at a sublethal dose (0.5\u00d7 MIC). The amount of ROS increased substantially when polymer/rifampicin combination was used. The increase in the ROS level might be due to greater cytosolic stress caused by the complementary functional mechanisms of polymer (binding with nucleic acids) and rifampicin (inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis). DNA binding by antimicrobial polymers was also observed by Zhou et\u00a0al.[\n\n47\n\n] to cause strong SOS response, leading to elevation of intracellular ROS level.[\n\n48\n\n] The rapid production of ROS implies a final effector role in bacterial cell death following treatment with polymer/rifampicin combination.[\n\n49\n\n]\nThe overwhelming stress experienced by the bacteria undergoing treatment with the combination therapy was also supported by the findings from next generation RNA\u2010seq analysis (Figure S8, Supporting Information). Treatment of A. baumannii BAA\u20101709 with the combination therapy for 5 min led to the upregulation of various genes associated with stress response pathways, including acyl\u2010CoA dehydrogenase[\n\n50\n\n] and NADH dehydrogenase,[\n\n51\n\n] which catalyze ROS production, heat shock proteins,[\n\n52\n\n] phage\u2010like and bacteriophage genes,[\n\n53\n\n] as well as NADH\u2010quinone oxidoreductase[\n\n54\n\n] (Tables S4\u2013S7, Supporting Information). This phenomenon was not observed in the bacteria treated with either rifampicin or polymer alone. This further indicates that the combination therapy was highly potent, resulting in massive stress experienced by the bacteria. Interestingly, the gene associated with bacteriolytic activity (bacteriolytic lipoprotein entericidin B) was upregulated only in the bacteria treated with pEt_20/rifampicin combination, suggesting that the combination therapy might trigger programmed cell death.[\n\n55\n\n]\n\n## Toxicity Evaluation and In Vivo Antimicrobial Efficacy\nTo evaluate if the polymer/rifampicin combination is suitable for in vivo application, in vitro and in vivo toxicity was investigated. Rifampicin, polymer and their combination did not cause significant hemolysis in rat red blood cells (rRBCs) even at 500\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 (Figure S9a, Supporting Information), and the combination did not increase cytotoxicity of rifampicin in HEK293T human embryonic kidney cell line (Figure S9b, Supporting Information). In addition, the polymer likely does not have the tendency to interact with genetic materials of mammalian cells as it did not enter the nucleus at least after 1 h (Figure S9c, Supporting Information), which is desirable for future clinical application. Moreover, similar to rifampicin, liver and kidney functions, sodium ion and potassium ion concentrations remained largely unchanged at 2 and 14 days post treatment with the combination (Figure S10a, Supporting Information). The combination therapy did not cause liver and kidney tissue damage (Figure S10b,c, Supporting Information). These findings demonstrate that the combination treatment did not induce in vivo toxicity.\nAfter demonstrating in vivo applicability of the combination, in vivo antimicrobial efficacy of the combination was evaluated in a mouse model of bacteremia caused by MDR A. baumannii (BAA\u20101789) (Figure\u00a0\n6a). Importantly, the rifampicin/polymer combination therapy provided a significantly higher survival rate than monotherapy using rifampicin or polymer (Figure\u00a06b). An increased rifampicin dose in the combination led to higher survival rates (Figure S10d, Supporting Information). Similarly, the combination therapy reduced the blood bacterial load more effectively than rifampicin (2.4\u2010log CFU reduction vs 1.1\u2010log CFU reduction in the bacterial counts) (Figure\u00a06c). These results were achieved with a single day treatment.\n\n## Conclusion\nWe have demonstrated that the co\u2010delivery of polymer with antibiotics reverses antibiotic resistance phenotype, and improves antibiotic potency. In addition, the use of the polymer allows for the effective repositioning of rifampicin and auranofin meant for Gram\u2010positive bacteria and arthritis, respectively, to be highly effective against MDR Gram\u2010negative bacteria. Phenotypic analysis has demonstrated the affinity of pEt_20 to the membrane, transient membrane depolarization, gene binding, intracellular protein precipitation, and subsequent ROS generation. Polymer/rifampicin combination leads to a significantly enhanced level of intracellular ROS that subsequently causes bacterial death. The translation of this combination therapy has been successfully demonstrated in a MDR A. baumannii\u2010caused bacteremia mouse model. This broadly applicable therapeutic combination approach with distinctive mechanisms shows great promise in the treatment of MDR Gram\u2010negative bacterial infections.\n\n## Materials\nA. baumannii strains BAA\u20101709, 19606, BAA\u20101789 (MDR strain), BAA\u20101792 (MDR strain), S. aureus strain 6538, E. coli strain 25922, E. aerogenes 13048, K. pneumonia 700603, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 9027 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

MM 4\u201364 dye (N\u2010(3\u2010triethylammoniumpropyl)\u20104\u2010(6\u2010(4\u2010(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide) was purchased from Santa Cruz. SYTOX Green was purchased from Life Technologies.\n\n## Polymer Synthesis and Characterization\nGuanidinium\u2010functionalized polycarbonates (pEt_10, pEt_20, and pEt_40)[\n\n31\n\n] and Alexa\u2010Fluor\u2010488\u2010labeled pEt_20[\n\n31\n\n] as well as quaternary ammonium\u2010functionalized polycarbonate (Qua_20)[\n\n44\n\n] were synthesized by advanced organocatalytic living ring\u2010opening polymerization and characterized according to the previously reported protocols. All polymers had well\u2010defined length and narrow molecular weight distribution (polydispersity index: 1.1\u20131.2).\n\n## MIC and MBC Measurements\nTo evaluate the antibacterial activity of antibiotics in the presence of polymer or colistin sulfate, the broth microdilution method was employed to measure MIC.[\n\n56\n\n] Bacteria suspension (A. baumannii, E. coli, E. aerogenes, or K. pneumoniae), which grew overnight was diluted with MHB to \u2248105 CFU mL\u22121. 96\u2010well plates containing diluted bacteria suspension and serially diluted antibiotics, polymer, colistin sulfate, or their combinations were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with shaking at 100\u00a0rpm for 18\u201320 h. The concentration, at which there was no bacterial growth reflected by unchanged optical density (OD) at 600\u00a0nm measured using a microplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland), was recorded as MIC. To evaluate the bactericidal activity of antibiotics, polymer, colistin sulfate, or their combinations, the bacteria suspension after 18 h treatment with antibiotics, polymer, colistin sulfate, or their combinations was serially diluted and streaked on LB agar plates. MBC was determined by counting the colonies formed on the plates after overnight incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The concentration of antibiotics, polymer, or colistin sulfate, at which there was more than 99.9% bacterial colony reduction, was recorded as MBC. MIC and MBC experiments were conducted in triplicates.\n\n## Killing Efficiency and Killing Kinetics\nA. baumannii BAA\u20101709 (\u2248105 CFU mL\u22121) was incubated with antibiotic, pEt_20, colistin sulfate, pEt_20/antibiotic combination or colistin/antibiotic combination at their 0.5\u00d7 MIC (pEt_20:7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 and colistin sulfate: 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121). After incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with shaking at 100\u00a0rpm, the bacteria were collected at 18 h and then serially diluted. The diluted bacterial suspension (20\u00a0\u00b5L) was streaked onto LB agar plates and CFUs were counted after overnight incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The results of CFU counting are presented as mean \u00b1 SD of three samples. In addition, the killing kinetics of rifampicin alone, rifampicin in combination with pEt_20 or colistin sulfate at their 0.5\u00d7 MIC was also tested. Specifically, A. baumannii BAA\u20101709 (\u2248105 CFU mL\u22121) was incubated with rifampicin alone (0.016\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121) and rifampicin in combination with pEt_20 or colistin sulfate at their 0.5\u00d7 MIC (pEt_20: 7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121; colistin sulfate: 0.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121). At predetermined time points (10, 30\u00a0min, 1, 2, 4, 24 h), a small portion of the bacterial suspension was collected, serial diluted, and streaked on LB agar plates. After incubation overnight, CFUs were counted and the results were presented as mean \u00b1 SD of three samples.\n\n## Mutant Selection\nA. baumannii BAA\u20101709 (\u2248108 CFU) were streaked onto MHB agar plates which contained rifampicin at concentrations of 1\u00d7 MBC (3.9\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121), 2\u00d7 MBC (7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121), or 5\u00d7 MBC (39.0\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121) (three replicates for each concentration). The bacteria on the plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 3 days. The colonies appearing on the plates were restreaked on rifampicin\u2010containing agar plates to confirm their resistance. The resistant colonies were collected and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for MIC and MBC measurements of rifampicin in the presence of pEt_20 or colistin sulfate.\nIn addition, to explore the antimicrobial mechanism of the polymer, mutant selection was also performed using pEt_20. Specifically, A. baumannii BAA\u20101709 (\u2248108 CFU) were streaked on MHB agar plates which contained pEt_20 at concentrations of 1\u00d7 MBC(agar) (750\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121). A. baumannii BAA\u20101709 (\u2248106 CFU) were applied onto MHB agar containing pEt_20 at different concentrations, and the concentration with at least 99.9% CFU reduction was determined to be the MBC(agar). However, no resistant colonies were found after 3\u2010day incubation. Moreover, there were no resistant colonies detected even when the bacteria loading was increased to 1.6 \u00d7 109 CFU. The results indicate that the frequency of resistance to pEt_20 was <\u00a01/(3 \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 109) = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 (3 represents triplicates).\n\n## Membrane Permeability\nA. baumannii BAA\u20101709 cells (\u2248107 CUF mL\u22121) were incubated with colistin sulfate (0.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121, 0.5\u00d7 MIC) or pEt_20 (7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121, 0.5\u00d7 MIC) for 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30\u00a0min. The cells were washed with phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) and PI dye (final concentration: 2\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121) was added. After 30 min incubation, 200\u00a0\u00b5L of bacterial suspension was added into a black 96\u2010well plate and the fluorescence intensity (Ex: 535\u00a0nm, Em: 620\u00a0nm) was recorded by using a Tecan Spark 10M microplate reader.\n\n## Membrane Potential\nA. baumannii BAA\u20101709 cells were diluted to \u2248107 CUF mL\u22121 with MHB medium. The potentiometric probe DiSC3(5) was added in the medium at a final concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\u22126\nm. The fluorescence intensity (Ex: 620\u00a0nm, Em: 680\u00a0nm) of DiSC3(5) was monitored for 1 h in dark at room temperature (200\u00a0\u00b5L per well in black 96\u2010well plate). The polymer with final concentration at 7.8\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u22121 was added to the medium containing the bacteria and DiSC3(5), and the fluorescence intensity was monitored using the microplate reader.\n\n## Quantification of Intracellular Protein Precipitation\n5\u00a0mL of A. baumannii BAA\u20101709 log phase culture was treated with increasing concentration of pEt_20 for 24 h followed by c",
