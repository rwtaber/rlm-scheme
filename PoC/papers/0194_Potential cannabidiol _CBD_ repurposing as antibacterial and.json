For most of the GNB studied, our results showed that low concentrations of PB (\u2264\u20092\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) allow CBD (\u2264\u20094\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) to exert antibacterial activity against GNB (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii), including PB-resistant GNB. CBD\u2009+\u2009PB also showed additive and/or synergistic effect against LOS-expressing GND. Time-kill assays results showed that the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB leads to a greater reduction in the number of colony forming units per milliliter compared to CBD and PB alone, at the same concentration used in combination, and the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB was synergistic for all four PB-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates evaluated. Our results show that CBD has translational potential and should be further explored as a repurposed antibacterial agent in clinical trials. The antibacterial efficacy of the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB against multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant GNB, especially PB-resistant K. pneumoniae, is particularly promising.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance is a worldwide public health problem arising from increased incidence of bacterial health care-associated infections (HAI) caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus; Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens1,2.\nGram-negative bacilli (GNB) resistant to third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and to carbapenem have been of particular concern, especially carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE; e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase [KPC] producers), ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant (CAZ-AVI) and ceftalozane-tazobactam-resistant strains, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB), and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA)3,4.\nIn this context, the last-resort antibiotic polymyxin B (PB) has been used in clinical practice to treat serious infections caused by MDR/XDR GNB5. The antibacterial activity of polymyxins is due to an electrostatic interaction between the positively charged polymyxin and the phosphate groups of the negatively charged lipid A, on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or lipooligosaccharide (LOS), in the outer membrane of GNB. Interaction with PB destabilizes LPS or LOS, leading to disruption of the bacterial cell envelop3.\nHowever, acquired resistance to polymyxins (including chromosomal and plasmid-mediated resistance) has been increasingly detected in several GNB, such as Enterobacterales species (e.g., K. pneumoniae) and nonfermenting GNB (e.g., A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa). Polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative (GN) bacteria usually have the addition of phosphoethanolamine and/or 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose cationic groups on their lipid A molecule, giving them positive charges and resulting in electrostatic repulsion (instead of interaction) of the polymyxin molecule3.\nConsidering health, social and economic implications of growing antimicrobial resistance, the World Health Organization (WHO) calls attention to research, discovery, and development of new antibiotics against MDR/XDR ESKAPE pathogens6.\nIn this scenario, many substances have been investigated regarding their antimicrobial activity, including natural products. Cannabidiol (CBD) is the major non-psychoactive component isolated from Cannabis sativa and has been associated with multiple and potential biological activities, especially anxiolytic, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties7\u20139. Regarding its biological activity in bacteria, CBD was described as inhibitor of membrane vesicles released from GNB and as inhibitor of biofilm formation as well as being capable of eradicating preformed biofilms10. Since the 1950s, C. sativa-based preparations have also been investigated for their antibacterial activity11\u201313. Nonetheless, few studies described the antibacterial activity of ultrapure CBD against Gram-positive (GP) bacteria; although, CBD is not antibacterial against GNB9,11\u201317.\nAnother promising strategy to tackle antibacterial resistance is combination therapy, specifically combinations that allow the use of a lower concentration of each substance in the combination or that allow the antibacterial activity of substances that would otherwise not reach the bacterial target (e.g., due to impermeability)18,19. Besides their inhibitory activity, antibiotics can exert other effects on bacterial cells, even at sublethal concentrations20. In this context, the minimal effective antibiotic concentration (MEAC), defined as the minimal sublethal concentration that produces an effect on bacterial cells (e.g., outer membrane destabilization), might allow or improve the action of another antibacterial substance, thus making the combination antibacterial21,22.\nThe present study aimed to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of ultrapure CBD against a wide diversity of bacteria, including MDR/XDR ESKAPE pathogens (44 different species, 96 strains), and the in vitro antibacterial activity of the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB against GN bacteria, including PB-susceptible and PB-resistant GNB (chromosomal-acquired and plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant) and intrinsically-resistant GN bacteria (16 species, 56 strains), comprising both standard strains and clinical isolates.\n\n## CBD antibacterial activity against GP and GN bacteria, and \nCBD showed different levels of antibacterial activity (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC]) against all 13 different species of GP bacteria (21 strains) evaluated, including susceptible and MDR strains: MIC\u2009=\u20092\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for E. faecium (n\u2009=\u20092); MIC\u2009=\u20094\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for Enterococcus spp. (n\u2009=\u20094), Staphylococcus spp. (n\u2009=\u200910), Micrococcus luteus (n\u2009=\u20091), and Rhodococcus equi (n\u2009=\u20091); MIC\u2009=\u200932\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for Streptococcus pyogenes (n\u2009=\u20091) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n\u2009=\u20091); and MIC\u2009=\u200964\u00a0\u00b5g/mL Streptococcus agalactiae (n\u2009=\u20091) (Supplementary Table 1).\nThe antibacterial activity of CBD was also observed for LOS-expressing GN diplococcus (GND) such as Moraxella catarrhalis ATCC 25238 (MIC\u2009=\u200964\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), Neisseria meningitidis ATCC 13077 (MIC\u2009=\u2009128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 19424 (MIC\u2009=\u2009256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). Additionally, CBD was antibacterial against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (MIC\u2009=\u200912.5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and MDR M. tuberculosis CF86 (MIC\u2009=\u200925\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). We observed no difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values among susceptible and MDR strains evaluated.\nFor S. aureus ATCC 29213, we observed a higher CBD MIC (64\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) when the assay was performed using MH-F broth (5% lysed horse blood +\u20090.1% \u03b2-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [\u03b2-NAD] 20\u00a0mg/mL), compared to standard protocols using Cation-Adjusted Mueller Hinton II Broth (CAMHB) for S. aureus (CBD MIC\u2009=\u20094\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01)23,24.\nCBD in concentrations up to 256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL was not antibacterial for any of the tested GNB (27 species, 70 strains) (Supplementary Table 1). We also evaluated higher concentrations of CBD for E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, but again no antibacterial activity was observed up to 8.192\u00a0\u00b5g/mL.\nAdditionally, we did not detect any antibacterial activity of CBD in the presence of efflux pump inhibitors (phenylalanine-arginine-\u03b2-naphthylamide [PA\u03b2N], reserpine, or curcumin) against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens (K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, A. baumannii ATCC 19606, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, E. cloacae ATCC 13047) as well as against E. coli ATCC 25922 and 72H (MCR-1-producing clinical isolate) and S. maltophilia ATCC 13637 strains. For all strains, CBD combined to the efflux pump inhibitors evaluated was not antibacterial up to 256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of CBD.\n\n## Screening by broth microdilution method with fixed concentration of CDB (256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL)\nWe observed antibacterial activity of the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB against 8/13 different species (47/52 strains) of GNB, including standard strains (Table 1) and clinical isolates (Table 2).Table 1PB concentrations in the combination of CBD (256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL)\u2009+\u2009PB minimal effective antibiotic concentration (MEAC), compared to PB, MIC against standard strains, type strains, and characterized strains.StrainPB (\u00b5g/mL)Strain characteristics;

Also, the combination of CBD\u2009+\u2009PB against K. pneumoniae led to a twofold reduction in PB concentration compared to PB MIC, while only a onefold reduction was observed for P. aeruginosa (Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02A).\nRegarding PB-resistant GNB (Enterobacterales), the combination of CBD plus low concentrations of PB (\u2264\u20092\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) showed antibacterial activity against chromosomal PB-resistant GNB, including PB-resistant K. pneumoniae (Table 2). However, for plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant (MCR-1) E. coli strains, we only observed a onefold reduction in PB concentration compared to PB MIC (Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02B\u2013F).\nThe combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB\u2009+\u2009PA\u03b2N showed increased antibacterial activity against GNB so that lower concentrations of PB were required when compared to the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB (Table 3). Interestingly, this combination (CBD\u2009+\u2009PB\u2009+\u2009PA\u03b2N) also showed antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa and plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant (MCR-1) E. coli 72H strains (Table 3).Table 3PB concentrations in the combination of CBD (256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL)\u2009+\u2009PB\u2009+\u2009PA\u03b2N (50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) compared to PB concentrations in the combination of CBD (256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL)\u2009+\u2009PB.StrainPB MIC (\u00b5g/mL)CBD 256\u00a0\u00b5g/mLCBD 256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL plus PA\u03b2N 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mLPA\u03b2N 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL+\u2009PB MEAC (\u00b5g/mL)+\u2009PB MEAC (\u00b5g/mL)+\u2009PB MEAC (\u00b5g/mL)K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883a80.125\u2264\u20090.018K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-17050.50.250.010.25K. quasipneumoniae ATCC 7006030.50.1250.030.25E. coli ATCC 259220.50.06\u2264\u20090.0020.03E. coli 72Hb21\u2264\u20090.011E. coli NCTC 1384621\u2264\u20090.031A. baumannii ATCC 19606a10.25\u2264\u20090.0051A. baumannii 136 SPc10.250.061P. aeruginosa ATCC 2785311\u2264\u20090.0050.06P. aeruginosa HC 103j21\u2264\u20090.0050.06P. aeruginosa PAO110.5\u2264\u20090.0050.06S. maltophilia 13673a20.25\u2264\u20090.010.03E. tarda ATCC 15947a>\u200980.25\u2264\u20090.01>\u20098CBD Cannabidiol, PB Polymyxin B, ATCC American Type Culture Collection.aType strain.bFernandes et al.27.cCl\u00edmaco et al.30.dGaletti et al.29.\nCBD\u2009+\u2009PB also presented antibacterial activity against intrinsically PB-resistant E. tarda ATCC 15947 (Table 1).

Also, the overall reduction in CFU/mL of the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB relative to PB alone was above 2 log10 for many time points, further confirming the synergistic effect of CBD and PB (Table 6).Figure 1Time-kill experiments for the PB-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (A) C9, (B) L8, (C) L28, and (D) L29. Strains were inoculated on Mueller Hinton broth containing either PB alone or in combination with CBD (2 or 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). A control group was grown in the absence of any drug. At time points 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6\u00a0h, an aliquot was removed, and number of cells was determined by inoculating on solid medium and counting colony forming units. The initial time point of each treatment was used as normalization factor. Values represent mean and error bars are standard deviation of the mean from three independent experiments. Asterisks indicate that means are statistically different from the corresponding control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Preliminary results regarding ultrapure CBD activity in GP bacteria and its absence in GN bacteria (including MDR and XDR strains) were partially presented by us at ASM Microbe 2018 and published in the abstract book13.\nFurthermore, our results revealed antibacterial activity of CBD against other species, namely Enterococcus casseliflavus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Micrococcus luteus, and Rhodococcus equi, and also against different phenotype/genotype of GP bacteria (Supplementary Table 1). In general, our data and previous reports showed CBD MICs ranging from 2 to 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL against GP bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE), and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and vancomycin-intermediate resistant (VISA) S. aureus, all of them listed in the WHO priority pathogens list for R&D of new antibiotics16.\nOur data differ from the data by Blaskovich et al. on CBD MICs against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. catarrhalis, and M. tuberculosis16. Differences in observed MIC values may be related to the different methodology in each of the studies. For fastidious bacteria, such as S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, M. catarrhalis, and N. meningitidis, we used MH-F broth (CAMHB supplemented with 5% lysed horse blood +\u20090.1% \u03b2-NAD 20\u00a0mg/mL), according to a standard protocol by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)31. For N. gonorrhoeae, we employed the broth microdilution method instead of agar dilution. Blaskovich et al. used a broth culture medium composed of a lower content of lysed horse blood (3%) for S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and a modified broth according to standards from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for Neisseria spp., which does not contain blood16. The presence of blood in culture media (e.g., MH-F broth) increases CBD MIC, as observed in our study for S. aureus (fourfold dilution increased CBD MIC) when compared to only CAMHB, a result similar to previous reports12. These differences may have contributed to our higher CBD MIC values against fastidious bacteria compared to those of Blaskovich et al.16.\nFor M. tuberculosis, we observed lower CBD MIC values than those of Blaskovich et al. They used a 5-day incubation period , the addition of 12.5uL of 20% Tween 80 into resazurin, and a culture medium supplemented with ADC (albumin, dextrose, catalase) (Difco Laboratories), 0.5% glycerol, and 0.02% tyloxapol16. We used a period of incubation of 7\u00a0days, no Tween 80 into resazurin, a culture medium supplemented with OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase), and glycerol 0,4%. The difference between OADC and ADC is the presence of oleic acid at 0.5\u00a0g/L.\nOur results reinforce that CBD alone is not antibacterial against GNB (MDR/XDR or susceptible to antibiotics), because we evaluated 27 species (70 strains) of GNB species most commonly involved in HAI as well as in community infections, expanding the panel of GNB and human pathogens investigated (Supplementary Table 1).\nIn an attempt to understand this lack of effect, we used various efflux pump inhibitors to potentially improve CBD activity. However, our data also showed no role of efflux pumps that are commonly involved in antibiotic extrusion from GN cell. Therefore, we hypothesized that CBD was inactive due to low permeability through the cell envelope (outer membrane) of GNB.\nThe absence of antibacterial activity of CBD against GNB may be related to LPS molecules and outer membrane proteins, from the outer membrane, which would lead to the impermeability of macromolecules and limited diffusion of hydrophobic molecules, such as CBD14\u201316. Our results of in vitro CBD antibacterial activity against GP bacteria and M. tuberculosis, and the absence of CBD antibacterial activity against GNB, support a role for LPS in hindering CBD activity.\nFurthermore, we also assessed LOS-expressing bacteria such as N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, and M. catarrhalis. The LOS molecule lacks the O-antigen of LPS32,33, thereby allowing us to evaluate a potential role of O-antigen in preventing CBD antibacterial activity (possibly due to the steric effect, hindering CBD from reaching its molecular target).\nEven considering that A. baumannii and H. influenzae also have LOS molecules on their external membrane, but the core polysaccharide for these bacteria presents a different sugar composition32,34. This fact could explain the absence of CBD antibacterial activity against these GN bacteria. CBD and cannabigerol (CBG, another cannabinoid) have antibacterial activity against A. baumannii only in the absence of the complete LOS molecule, according to previous studies14,16.\nThe hydrophobic chemical structure of CBD points towards an interaction with lipid in membranes as described by Guard et al. for eukaryotic cells. This interaction alters the biophysical properties of the membrane and affects lipid and cholesterol metabolism35,36. Indeed, the bacterial membrane was also suggested as a possible bacterial target for cannabinoids (CBG and CBD)11,14,16. Furthermore, Blaskovich et al. also showed that bactericidal concentrations of CBD against S. aureus inhibits the synthesis of proteins, DNA, RNA, and peptidoglycan16. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism(s) for the antibacterial activity of CBD has not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, our results contribute to a better understanding of CBD antibacterial mechanism(s) of action, which could guide future studies.\n\n## Antibacterial activity of the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB\nPrevious studies reported the antibacterial activity of CBD in combination with PB, although only few bacterial species and strains were evaluated (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii)14,16,17,37.\nHere we assessed the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB against several GNB (8 species, 48 strains), focusing on pathogens from the WHO list for the R&D of new antibiotics, including MDR and XDR international high-risk clones (e.g., KPC-producing K. pneumoniae ST 258 and ST 11, CTX-M-15-producing E. coli ST 131, SPM-producing P. aeruginosa ST 277, and OXA-143-producing A. baumannii ST 109) (Tables 1 and 2).\nFor most GNB, our checkerboard results showed that CBD concentrations lower than 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL were sufficient for antibacterial activity in the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB. Also, PB concentrations needed for the combination to be antibacterial were up to eight-fold lower than the MIC for PB.\nFurthermore, for PB-resistant GNB (highlighting K. pneumoniae strains), 2\u20134\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of CBD were enough to lead to bacterial growth inhibition when combined with clinically optimal PB concentrations (Table 4).\nAccording to EUCAST/BrCAST breakpoints, bacteria presenting PB MIC \u2264\u20092\u00a0\u00b5g/mL are categorized as susceptible, and there is a high likelihood of therapeutic success using a standard dosing regimen of PB23,38. On the other hand, according to CLSI breakpoints, bacteria with PB MIC \u2264\u20092\u00a0\u00b5g/mL are categorized as intermediate as there is no longer a CLSI \u2018susceptible\u2019 category for polymyxins. CLSI argues that polymyxins monotherapy would have limited clinical efficacy and suggests combination therapy with another antibacterial24. In our study, we used the EUCAST/BrCAST breakpoint (PB MIC \u2264\u20092\u00a0\u00b5g/mL as susceptible) for our analyses and discussion.\nAdditionally, time-kill results showed the killing effect of the combination of CBD\u2009+\u2009PB over time, contributing to future studies and perspectives on dose-exposure response relationships and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters.\nAmong intrinsically PB-resistant GNB, the combination of CBD\u2009+\u2009PB showed antibacterial activity only against E. tarda. These results may be related to the different intrinsic resistance mechanisms of these bacteria, involving different molecular pathways from two-component systems3,39.\nFor the GND N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, and M. catarrhalis, the calculation of FICI revealed an additive or synergistic effects for the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB (Table 5). Nevertheless, PB is not used for the treatment of GND-caused infections due to PB intrinsic resistance. However, the synergistic effect may suggest a new insight for this bactericidal activity of the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB, highlighting that PB also neutralizes the endotoxin Lipid A from LPS/LOS of GN bacteria40.\n\n## Biological activity of the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB (+\u2009PA\u03b2N)\nCBD alone shows antibacterial activity against GP bacteria, M. tuberculosis, and LOS-expressing GND; however, it does not show antibacterial activity against GNB, probably due to the presence of LPS molecules and outer membrane proteins, from the outer membrane, resulting in impermeability of CBD.\nPB alone shows antibacterial activity against GN bacteria and the use of this antibiotic in clinical practices depends on in vitro susceptibility breakpoints and on bacterial species identified23,24,38. PB promotes the destabilization of LPS or LOS, leading to the disruption of the bacterial cell envelope3.\nConsidering the antibacterial activity of the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB against GNB, our results also point to the existence of a CBD molecular target in GNB and indicate that its activity is dependent on bacterial outer membrane destabilization promoted by PB.\nCBD is the antibacterial agent in the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB, considering that the concentrations of PB used in the combination were PB MEAC, which are sublethal (subinhibitory) (Fig.\u00a02). This biological activity is supported by time-kill results showing that PB MEAC alone has the same behavior as the growth control in the killing curve (Fig.\u00a01).Figure 2Schematic representation of PB MIC and PB MEAC. (A) PB MIC: Polymyxin B minimal concentration that disrupts the outer and inner membranes of GNB and leads to bacterial growth inhibition. (B) PB MEAC: Polymyxin B sub-inhibitory concentration that leads to minimal disrupt or destabilization of bacterial outer membrane but does not lead to bacterial growth inhibition. PB MEAC allows CBD antibacterial activity in the combination CBD\u2009+\u2009PB, even against PB-resistant strains containing phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) and/or 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) cationic groups on their lipid A molecule.\nOutstandingly, the combinatio",
