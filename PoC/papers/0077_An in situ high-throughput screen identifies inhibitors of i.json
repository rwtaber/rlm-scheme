  "abstract": "Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) and Burkholderia mallei (Bm) are Tier-1 Select Agents that cause melioidosis and glanders, respectively. These are highly lethal human infections with limited therapeutic options. Intercellular spread is a hallmark of Burkholderia pathogenesis, and its prominent ties to virulence make it an attractive therapeutic target. We developed a high-throughput cell-based phenotypic assay and screened \u223c220,000 small molecules for their ability to disrupt intercellular spread by Burkholderia thailandensis, a closely related BSL-2 surrogate. We identified 268 hits, and cross-species validation found 32 hits that also disrupt intercellular spread by Bp and/or Bm Among these were a fluoroquinolone analog, which we named burkfloxacin (BFX), which potently inhibits growth of intracellular Burkholderia, and flucytosine (5-FC), an FDA-approved antifungal drug. We found that 5-FC blocks the intracellular life cycle at the point of type VI secretion system 5 (T6SS-5)-mediated cell-cell spread. Bacterial conversion of 5-FC to 5-fluorouracil and subsequently to fluorouridine monophosphate is required for potent and selective activity against intracellular Burkholderia In a murine model of fulminant respiratory melioidosis, treatment with BFX or 5-FC was significantly more effective than ceftazidime, the current antibiotic of choice, for improving survival and decreasing bacterial counts in major organs. Our results demonstrate the utility of cell-based phenotypic screening for Select Agent drug discovery and warrant the advancement of BFX and 5-FC as candidate therapeutics for melioidosis in humans.",

  "full_text": "## A High-Throughput Phenotypic Screen Identifies Small-Molecule Inhibitors of \nThe cell fusion assay shown in Fig. 2A was adapted for high-throughput screening by seeding eGFP-expressing HEK293 cells into 384-well plates pinned with a library of small molecules, infecting cells with Burkholderia, and imaging 18 to 22 h later using laser scanning cytometry to assess the relative abundance and size of plaques (Fig. 2 B and C). Given that the readout results from cell fusion mediated by intracellular bacteria, the assay is capable of identifying compounds that inhibit any step of the intracellular infection pathway, have relatively low toxicity against mammalian cells, and are capable of penetrating both the host cell plasma membrane and the gram-negative cell envelope.\nA curated small-molecule library was screened for inhibitory activity against intracellular Bt strain E264 utilizing the facilities of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Molecular Screening Shared Resource (MSSR). Fig. 2C shows a pilot screen using an FDA-approved sublibrary of 1,120 compounds, demonstrating the ability to identify known (trimethoprim) as well as new inhibitors. Screening efforts were then scaled to accommodate >220,000 compounds. Over the course of the screen, control wells yielded negligible false-positive (0%) and false-negative (0.0091%) hit rates. An initial set of 268 compounds was found to inhibit plaque formation by Bt E264, yielding a conservative primary hit rate of 0.0012. Validation was conducted using Bt E264, Bp 1026b (Thai clinical isolate), and Bm 23344 (human isolate), resulting in 114 (43%) validated compounds that were binned according to species activity (Fig. 2D). Of these, 4 compounds, including 3 known antibiotics and 1 molecule which we named burkfloxacin (BFX), were found to consistently inhibit plaque formation by all 3 organisms. Seven compounds, including 4 known antibiotics, inhibited plaque formation by Bm and Bp, and 4 compounds were specific for Bm only, including monensin and the antimalarial drug artemisinin. Flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine, 5-FC), an FDA-approved antimycotic, was identified among the hits with activity against Bp and Bt but not Bm. Following validation of activity against intracellular Burkholderia, cytotoxicity was assessed in HEK293 cells using an ATP-depletion cell viability assay. Both BFX and 5-FC had no apparent effect on cell viability at concentrations 10-fold higher than the IC100 (SI Appendix, Table S1) and were prioritized for follow-up studies.\n\n## BFX Potently Inhibits Growth of Intracellular \nBFX (Fig. 3A) is a morpholinated fluoroquinolone analog originally synthesized in 1980 by Koga et al. (48). In this and a subsequent study (49), it was found to have in vitro activity against a limited panel of bacterial species and a favorable toxicity profile. We confirmed that BFX is active against other gram-negative organisms in vitro, showing similar potency to the widely used fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin (Cip), against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (SI Appendix, Table S2). We also confirmed that BFX, like Cip, functions as a canonical fluoroquinolone by demonstrating its ability to inhibit the negative DNA supercoiling activity of E. coli DNA gyrase (Fig. 3B).\nAs shown in Fig. 3C, BFX results in near-complete inhibition of plaque formation by Bt and Bp at a concentration of 0.5 \u00b5M. In the intracellular growth experiment in Fig. 3D, bacteria replicate exponentially in the absence of drug until \u223c16 h, when membrane damage accumulates to an extent sufficient to expose intracellular bacteria to bactericidal levels of kanamycin present in the media. In contrast, intracellular growth is ablated following treatment with BFX. When compared to Cip present at the same concentration (1.0 \u00b5m), BFX resulted in a 7-fold reduction in colony forming units (CFU) at the point of maximal intracellular growth (16 h, Fig. 3E), and in plaque assays, BFX inhibited cell\u2013cell spread at an 8-fold lower concentration compared to Cip (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Interestingly, significantly higher doses of BFX (5 \u00b5M) were needed to inhibit growth in laboratory medium (Fig. 3F), compared to intracellular growth in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that BFX accumulation may occur inside mammalian cells as observed with certain other fluoroquinolones (50).\n\n## The FDA-Approved Antifungal, 5-FC, Inhibits Intercellular Spread at the Step of Cell\u2013Cell Fusion.\nOur screen also identified 5-FC (Fig. 4A), an FDA-approved antimycotic, as an inhibitor of plaque formation by Bt and Bp. Flucytosine is a fluorinated cytosine analog that serves as a first-line therapy for serious fungal infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis (51), and is included in the World Health Organization\u2019s List of Essential Medicines (52). In light of its established efficacy as an antifungal agent, we investigated the mechanism of 5-FC activity as an inhibitor of Burkholderia cell\u2013cell spread. As shown in Fig. 4B, 5-FC inhibits plaque formation by Bt and Bp in a dose-dependent fashion, as indicated by a decrease in both plaque numbers and size (also see Fig. 2C). Flucytosine does not affect bacterial growth in laboratory medium at a concentration that nearly eliminates plaque formation (Fig. 4C). Similarly, 5-FC does not prevent growth of intracellular bacteria at concentrations that inhibit plaque formation, although a decrease and delay in attaining peak bacterial numbers is observed (Fig. 4D). Plaque formation is inhibited whether 5-FC is added to cells before or after bacterial infection (Fig. 4E), indicating an effect on a late intracellular life cycle event. This contrasts with 2 other compounds identified in our screen, Invasion Inhibitor-1 (II-1) and Invasion Inhibitor-2 (II-2), which show strong inhibition of cell\u2013cell spread when added prior to infection but minimal activity when added after infection, as expected for inhibitors of invasion (Fig. 4E). For 5-FC, the proportion of cytosolic bacteria associated with actin tails is equivalent in treated and untreated cells (Fig. 4F). Importantly, in comparison to the wild-type (WT) strain (Fig. 4D), peak intracellular growth levels of a fusion-defective \u2206vgrG5 mutant (31) were not significantly affected by 5-FC (Fig. 4G), although we did observe a delay that was similar to that seen with the WT strain (Fig. 4D). Since cell fusion allows expansion of the Burkholderia replicative niche and facilitates intracellular replication, the lack of a difference in peak numbers for the \u2206vgrG5 mutant with or without 5-FC, together with time of addition data (Fig. 4E) and observations of actin polymerization by cytosolic bacteria (Fig. 4F), support the hypothesis that 5-FC inhibits a late-stage event in the intracellular life cycle that is required for cell fusion.\nTo further explore the inhibitory mechanism, we investigated the effects of 5-FC on the expression of virulence loci known to facilitate intracellular survival and cell\u2013cell spread (53). Quantitative RT-PCR measurements of transcripts from genes involved in virulence regulation (virG and bsaN), endosome escape (bsaM and bopE), intracellular motility (fliC2 and bimA), or T6SS-5\u2013dependent membrane fusion (clpV5 and vgrG5) were performed on RNA isolated from HEK293 cells infected with Bt E264 in the presence or absence of 5-FC. With treatment, we found a modest (\u22644-fold) and variable reduction in the expression of virG, bsaM, bimA, and vgrG5 and an even smaller effect on bsaN, bopE, flic2, or clpV5 (Fig. 4H). This seemed unlikely to account for the near-complete elimination of plaque formation observed with 5-FC at the same concentration (25 \u00b5m), and more likely due to secondary growth effects resulting from the lack of efficient cell fusion. Finally, we examined whether 5-FC has an inhibitory effect on the functionality of T6SS-5 in vitro using a previously established assay (31) involving strains engineered to constitutively express VirAG, a 2-component regulatory system that normally activates T6SS-5 gene expression in the mammalian cell cytosol (54). On Western blots, we observed a significant decrease in the quantity of Hcp5, the T6SS-5 intertubule subunit protein, secreted into culture supernatants by Bt and Bp following 5-FC treatment (Fig. 4I). In contrast, expression of Hcp5 was not noticeably affected by 5-FC, as demonstrated by equivalent signal intensities in the cell pellet fractions of treated vs. untreated controls (Fig. 4I). These results are consistent with an inhibitory effect of 5-FC on the assembly or secretion activity of T6SS-5 and a consequent decrease in the efficiency of cell\u2013cell spread.\n\n## Flucytosine Is a Prodrug That Requires Conversion to 5-Fluorouracil and Fluorouridine Monophosphate.\nThe antifungal activity of 5-FC against Cryptococcus neoformans and other fungal pathogens is due to the cytotoxicity of its metabolic products, making it a prodrug (51, 55). As summarized in Fig. 5A, following uptake by cytosine permease (CodB) and conversion to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by cytosine deaminase (CodA), 5-FC metabolism bifurcates into 2 pathways which ultimately result in antifungal activity via inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. Orthologous enzymes and pathways are encoded by Bp complex species (Fig. 5A); however, bacterial growth in vitro is unaffected by 5-FC at concentrations that suppress Hcp5 secretion under identical growth conditions (Fig. 4 C and I) and abolish plaque formation by intracellular organisms (Fig. 4B). Although the reason for the lack of a primary effect on bacterial growth is presently unknown, it nonetheless implies a unique mechanism for the inhibitory activity of 5-FC. To explore this, we examined the roles of key metabolic enzymes and products in the ability of 5-FC to inhibit cell\u2013cell spread.\nPathway 1 (Fig. 5A) is involved in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotide triphosphates. We found that 25 \u00b5M 5-FU, like 5-FC, abolished plaque formation (Fig. 5B). Fluorouridine (FUR), an intermediate between 5-FU and fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP), was minimally inhibitory at 25 \u00b5M but fully inhibitory at 50 \u00b5M, suggesting a role for pathway 1. This is consistent with a lack of inhibition by fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR), a pathway 2 intermediate, at concentrations up to 50 \u00b5M. We next investigated metabolic genes for critical roles in the activity of 5-FC (Fig. 5C), taking advantage of the availability of an arrayed library of transposon insertion mutants in Bt (56). Mutations in genes encoding cytosine deaminase (codA::TnT23) or uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (upp::TnT23) conferred partial or complete resistance to 5-FC, respectively, while mutants defective in thymidine phosphorylase (TP, deoA::TnT23) or ribonucleotide reductase (RR, Bth_II1936::TnT23) remained susceptible. The partial sensitivity of the codA::TnT23 strain could be due to residual activity of the mutant enzyme since the transposon insertion is positioned downstream from the active site of the multidomain aminohydrolase (56). Together, these observations suggest that pathway 2 metabolites, FUdR and FdUMP, are not required for inhibition, whereas metabolic conversion to pathway 1 intermediates 5-FU followed by FUMP is critical for the prodrug activity of 5-FC. FUMP or a downstream metabolite, therefore, are the likely inhibitors of T6SS-5-dependent intercellular spread.\n\n## Chemical Mutagenesis Screen for 5-FC Resistance Yields Mutations That Accelerate Cell\u2013Cell Spread.\nTo gain further insight into the inhibitory mechanism of 5-FC, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify mutations leading to resistance. WT Bt was treated with the DNA alkylating agent ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). Pooled mutagenized bacteria were then used to infect cells in the presence of 25 \u00b5M 5-FU (Fig. 6A). The use of 5-FU, instead of 5-FC, eliminated selection for mutations in the CodB transporter or the CodA aminohydrolase. MNCs formed by mutagenized bacteria were isolated 16 h postinfection, lysed with detergent, and plated on L-agar for isolation of individual bacterial clones. Resistant phenotypes were validated by plaque assays in the presence of 5-FU. In total, \u223c6 million chemical mutants containing an average of 8 SNPs per genome were assessed (SI Appendix, Materials and Methods), and 20 demonstrated reproducible resistance to 5-FU. As detected by PCR amplicon sequencing, 12 of these resistant mutants had a single missense mutation at 1 of 10 different sites in upp, and 1 contained a nonsense mutation, validating our results with the upp::TnT23 insertion mutant (Fig. 5C). No mutations were identified in genes encoding downstream metabolic enzymes PyrH/PyrR or Ndk. The remaining resistant mutants were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) along with the parental WT strain. Since all genomes analyzed contained multiple chemically induced mutations, we searched for genomic regions in which SNPs were identified in more than 1 resistant mutant. Accordingly, 2 regions with clustered SNPs were found (Fig. 6B), one containing a pair of regulatory genes which we named Intercellular spread regulators A and B (isrA and isrB) and another that encodes an array of biosynthetic genes (thaP, thaO, and adjacent loci) that produce thailandamide, a polyketide antibiotic that inhibits fatty acid biosynthesis by targeting acetyl-coA carboxylase (AccA) (57, 58).\nSNP 1 (Fig. 6B) is located on chromosome II, 219 bp upstream of the isrA coding sequence (CDS) within a region predicted to encode the isrA promoter, and SNP 2 lies 80 bp upstream of a small, divergently expressed gene of unknown function (Bth_II1096). isrA encodes a predicted 28-kDa 2-component response regulator with a winged helix\u2013turn\u2013helix (HTH) DNA-binding domain. Although no apparent sensor gene is located nearby, directly upstream is a second orphan response regulator locus, isrB, that encodes a predicted DNA binding protein with a LuxR-type HTH domain. The availability of TnT23 insertions in isrA and isrB allowed us to assess their roles in susceptibility to 5-FC. In both cases, partial resistance was observed (Fig. 6C), with plaques that were uniformly smaller than the upp::TnT23 metabolic mutant yet similar to those observed with the original SNP-containing strains. Also located on chromosome II, SNP 3 is a synonymous substitution that falls in the thaO coding sequence, which encodes a polyketide synthase required for thailandamide biosynthesis, and SNP 4 results in a Glu to Lys substitution in ThaP, an adjacent polyketide synthase. Although the significance of the synonymous substitution associated with SNP3 was not immediately apparent, the presence of 2 independent SNPs in the thailandamide biosynthetic gene cluster prompted further examination. Indeed, using a thaP::TnT8 mutant, we observed partial resistance to 5-FC in plaque assays, similar to that seen with isrA and isrB mutant strains (Fig. 6C).\nTo our initial surprise, the isrA and thaP insertion mutants each displayed the striking phenotype of accelerated plaque development in the absence of 5-FC (Fig. 6D). For the isrA::TnT23 strain, hyper-plaque formation correlated with increased secretion of Hcp5, while the thaP::TnT8 mutant showed variable secretion activity. In either case, we propose that factors that normally limit the efficiency of cell\u2013cell spread were inactivated by mutations in chemically mutagenized cells or in independently selected transposon mutants, allowing intracellular Burkholderia to partially overcome concentrations of 5-FC that would otherwise abrogate cell\u2013cell spread. The potential basis for the unexpectedly similar phenotypes of mutations in isrA and thaP and the broader implications of pathways that confer resistance to 5-FC prodrug are considered below (Discussion).\n\n## BFX and 5-FC Are Efficacious in a Murine Model of Fulminant Melioidosis.\nGiven the effectiveness of BFX and 5-FC at inhibiting Burkholderia cell\u2013cell spread, we evaluated their therapeutic efficacy using a mouse model of acute fulminant melioidosis (59). BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 4,500 CFU of Bp 1026b, and BFX (10 mg/kg/day) or 5-FC (100 mg/kg/day) was administered intraperitoneally twice daily, with the first doses given 5 h after infection. Outcomes were compared to animals that were administered placebo (PBS + 20% DMSO) or ceftazidime (130 mg/kg/day), the current antibiotic of choice for treating acute melioidosis. All animals in the placebo group succumbed to infection within 3 d, and all ceftazidime-treated animals succumbed by 5 d postinfection. In contrast, all (100%) of mice receiving BFX and 3/8 (36.7%) mice treated with 5-FC survived 5 d postinfection (P < 0.001) (Fig. 7A). Moreover, 5/8 (63%) BFX-treated and 1/8 (12%) 5-FC\u2013treated mice survived for the duration of the study (10 d). Survival rates were inversely correlated with bacterial loads in major organs, as numbers of bacteria in the lungs, livers, and spleens of BFX-treated mice were decreased relative to placebo and ceftazidime-treated controls at 48 h postinfection (Fig. 7B). Bacterial loads were also decreased, although to a lesser extent, in 5-FC\u2013treated mice. Interestingly, the majority of surviving mice treated with 5-FC or BFX showed low or undetectable bacterial loads at 10 d in liver and spleen compared to lung tissue, suggesting that dissemination from the lung to these organs might portend a poor outcome (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Histopathology of pulmonary, hepatic, and splenic tissue from mice killed 48 h after infection revealed significantly reduced inflammation in 5-FC\u2013treated mice relative to PBS-treated and minimal inflammation in organs of BFX-treated mice (Fig. 7C). In summary, BFX and 5-FC demonstrate superiority to ceftazidime in a preclinical model of fulminant melioidosis.\n\n## Discussion\nThe goal of this study was to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the Burkholderia intercellular life cycle and to evaluate their therapeutic efficacy. Our cell-based phenotypic screen successfully identified inhibitors of intercellular spread by Bt, Bp, and Bm. We determined the mechanism of action of 1 highly potent molecule, BFX, as inhibition of DNA gyrase and link the effect of 5-FC to inhibition of cell\u2013cell spread, most likely at the point of T6SS-5\u2013mediated membrane fusion.\nThe intracellular and in vivo efficacy of BFX is intriguing given that fluoroquinolones have not generally been found effective for the treatment of melioidosis in animal models or human clinical trials (22). In contrast, our findings argue that BFX holds promise as a countermeasure against Bp and other pathogens. In comparison to ciprofloxacin, significantly increased potency of BFX was observed during intracellular but not extracellular growth, suggesting an ability to achieve higher concentrations of active compound in mammalian cells. If true, further study is warranted to determine if this is due to enhanced membrane permeability, a lower isoelectric point and increased activity in acidic compartments such as the phagolysosome (60, 61), or some other mechanism. A comprehensive assessment of BFX\u2019s spectrum of activity, particularly against other intracellular pathogens such as Shigella and Salmonella, may be informative and clinically relevant in this regard. In Burkholderia and other gram-negative bacteria, efflux pumps that actively export antibiotics across the bacterial cell envelope are a primary mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance (26, 62, 63). Thus, it will be of interest to determine if the enhanced relative potency of BFX against intracellular Burkholderia provides a means to overcome efflux-mediated resistance to an extent that improves clinical outcomes (8, 64).\nOur observation that 5-FC provided a significant survival benefit in a preclinical model of fulminant disease provides a compelling argument for evaluating the potential to repurpose this antifungal as an adjunctive therapy for melioidosis (65). As an FDA-approved drug, 5-FC has a well-established safety and clinical use profile and is readily accessible in many melioidosis-endemic locales. It exhibits excellent bioavailability and near ubiquitous distribution in host compartments, including cerebrospinal fluid (51). In Burkholderia, 5-FC acts as a prodrug that requires conversion to 5-FU and FUMP for inhibitory activity. This confers selectivity since human cells lack CodA and cannot efficiently metabolize 5-FC (51). In contrast to susceptible fungi (55), the lack of a primary effect on growth and the lack of dependence on thymidine phosphorylase or ribonucleotide reductase (Fig. 5) suggest that lethal inhibition of RNA or DNA synthesis are not of primary importance. Instead, our staging of the effects of 5-FC in relation to the intracellular life cycle (Fig. 4 B\u2013J), the observation that 5-FC suppresses Hcp5 secretion in vitro (Fig. 4I), and the phenotypes of resistant mutants (Fig. 6; see below) are consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition of T6SS-5 activity is primarily responsible for the ability of 5-FC to inhibit cell\u2013cell spread. Effects on other requirements for intracellular survival and replication may occur, but our results argue that they are not the primary point of inhibition in the assays we employed.\nIn our in vitro and cell-based assays, 5-FC acts as an antivirulence agent (66, 67), and targeting virulence as opposed to growth may be advantageous for several reasons. First, antivirulence agents are proposed to exert reduced selective pressure for resistance, although this has been difficult to demonstrate experimentally (66\u201368). Second, unlike conventional antibiotics which target widely conserved and essential pathways, antivirulence agents typically target pathogen-specific virulence pathways that are dispensable for growth and therefore may be less likely to disrupt beneficial microbes. Moreover, the unique mechanisms of action of antivirulence agents like 5-FC provide opportunities for synergy when combined with established therapies or promising leads such as BFX, which target growth. Further efforts to develop 5-FC will focus in part on its use as an adjunctive therapy to treat melioidosis.\nThrough chemical and targeted mutagenesis experiments, we have identified 3 general pathways to 5-FC resistance. The first and most efficient involves mutations in genes encoding cytosine deaminase (codA) or uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (upp), which are required for conversion of 5-FC prodrug to active metabolites, and we anticipate that mutations in the codB transporter locus would have a similar effect. Fluorinated pyrimidines have also been found to exert antivirulence effects in P. aeruginosa, and although the mechanism remains unclear, disruptions in codA and upp were similarly found to confer resistance (68, 69). A second pathway that leads to partial resistance results from mutations in a region of chromosome II that encodes putative regulatory factors such as IsrA and IsrB. Although further study is required to understand their roles in virulence, the intriguing observation that a transposon insertion in isrA results in accelerated plaque development in the absence of inhibitor suggests that IsrA plays a negative role in regulating 1 or more factors involved in intracellular spread. A third pathway, which also confers partial resistance, involves inactivation of a biosynthetic gene (thaP) required for production of thailandamide, a potent inhibitor of acetyl-coA carboxylase (AccA)-dependent fatty acid synthesis (57, 58). How might the lack of production of a polyketide antibiotic increase the efficiency of cell\u2013cell spread? An important clue comes from the observation that in addition to inhibiting growth of competing bacteria (57, 58), thailandamide has cytotoxic activity against mammalian cells (70). We speculate that partial disruption of host cell fatty acid biosynthesis by intracellular bacteria could alter membrane properties and decrease the efficiency of T6SS-5 dependent fusion or compromise mechanisms that repair membrane damage resulting from nonproductive deployment of the fusion machinery. In either case, eliminating thailandamide production would be predicted to increase the efficiency of cell\u2013cell spread as measured by in vitro plaque assays.\nHaving identified pathways to 5-FC resistance in vitro, it is important to consider their potential clinical relevance in relation to the ecology and epidemiology of Bp. Human infections invariably arise from environmental sources (4), and it seems likely that mutations in genes required for pyrimidine salvage (i.e., codA, codB, and upp) would be subject to negative selection in nature. The effects of such mutations on Bp virulence in animals are also unknown. Similarly, although disruption of isrA or other potential regulatory loci may increase the efficiency of intercellular spread in cell monolayers, further experiments will be required to determine if this correlates with increased or attenuated virulence in vivo. Given the importance of precise control in bacterial\u2013host interactions, we predict the latter possibility will be true. Finally, although thailandamide is produced by Bt strains, the biosynthetic gene cluster is absent from Bp and Bm genomes (71), making this pathway of lesser relevance for treating melioidosis or glanders. Nonetheless, it is tempting to speculate that inhibition of host cell fatty acid synthesis could contribute to the relative avirulence of Bt compared to Bp and Bm. Although our chemical mutagenesis screen was designed to reveal the mechanism of inhibition by 5-FC, mutations that implicate a specific molecular target were not identified. If 5-FC ultimately targets a factor required for T6SS-5 apparatus assembly, function, or deployment, it may be difficult or impossible to generate mutations in a single step that eliminate inhibition while preserving secretory and fusogenic activity, as dictated by our selection protocol. Similarly, effects on regulatory factors or levels of a small-molecule signal may be difficult to evade without disrupting essential control circuits. Given the apparent utility of 5-FC and the required role of T6SS-5 in pathogenesis, it is clearly of interest to identify the molecular targets and mechanisms responsible for inhibition.\nA limitation of our study is that the primary screen was conducted with the BSL-2 surrogate Bt for relative ease of manipulation. As we later found, many of our primary hits had no effect on Bp or Bm. Although Bt, Bp, and Bm utilize many conserved virulence mechanisms, their genomes differ considerably in size, metabolic gene content, and homology (71, 72). Subtle differences in intercellular life cycles, drug uptake or retention, or metabolic strategies of these species may have contributed to the differential susceptibility observed in our study. Although our screen was successful in identifying therapeutic leads for Bp and/or Bm, a potentially superior but more challenging approach would have been to conduct the primary screen using these Tier 1 pathogens under BSL-3 containment. Finally, our study demonstrated the efficacy of identified hits in clinical isolates; however, follow-on strain surveys will be required to guide translation to the clinical setting, as Bp is known to be genetically variable (10).\nCell-based phenotypic screens are a promising approach to drug discovery for intracellular bacterial pathogens, as validated hits will have a priori demonstrated the ability to traverse the host cell plasma membrane and bacterial cell envelope. This is especially advantageous for gram-negative pathogens, for which the outer membrane remains a formidable barrier for drug development (73). The high-throughput screen described here demonstrates the feasibility of this approach to identify new therapeutic leads for melioidosis and glanders.\n\n## Study Design.\nCompounds in the UCLA MSSR library (www.mssr.ucla.edu) were plated and tested in vitro for the ability to inhibit intercellular spread with the identities and order of compounds blinded to the experimenter. Due to its scale and expense, the \u223c220,000\u2013small-molecule HT screen was performed with each compound tested once in a single well. Small molecules deemed as positive hits in initial screening were cherry-picked from the larger library to form a small positive hit library. This hit library was used to validate positive hits in 384-well format, with at least 3 technical and 2 biological replicates per compound. Downstream cell-based infection experiments were performed with at least 3 technical and 2 biological replicates. Compounds were prioritized for further study based on their activity profiles and toxicity for mammalian cells. Two compounds, BFX and 5-FC, were selected for mechanistic studies, and their therapeutic efficacy was measured in vivo in a mouse model of melioidosis. Animal studies were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol #201609601. Animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and therapeutic efficacy was determined on the basis of mortality, organ bacterial loads, and histopathological findings. Sample sizes for in vivo studies were determined using Lamorte\u2019s power calculations and were selected to minimize the number of animals needed to obtain statistically significant results. The HT small-molecule screen, follow-up mechanistic assays, HT resistance screen, WGS and bioinformatics approach, animal experiments, and data analysis are described in detail in SI Appendix.",
