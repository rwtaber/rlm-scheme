  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAlso referred to as the silent pandemic, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most alarming threats posed to human health in the twenty-first century1. In 2019 alone, 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial AMR, of which 1.27 million were directly attributable to infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria2. The Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are among the top six bacteria responsible for these estimates2,3. In agreement, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB), P. aeruginosa (CRPA), and Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were placed at the very top of the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2019s list of priority pathogens under the \u201ccritical priority\u201d category. The fact that only one broad-spectrum agent, cefidorocol, is currently available to treat infections caused by all three bacteria highlights the urgent need for new therapeutic options, preferably with novel mechanisms of action (MoA)4.\nCarbohydrates are increasingly recognized as valuable scaffolds for the rational design and development of new compounds with antibiotic activity and innovative MoA5. In 2018, Rauter and co-workers reported a series of membrane-disrupting dodecyl deoxyglycosides with potent inhibitory activity against a small panel of Gram-positive bacteria, namely Bacillus anthracis (Sterne, ovine and pathogenic forms), Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus6. With a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12.6\u00a0\u03bcM against all tested pathogens, the 4,6-dideoxy \u03b1-D-glycoside 1 (Fig.\u00a01) was the best in the series, whereas the corresponding \u03b2-anomer (2) was virtually inactive (MIC\u2009>\u2009405\u00a0\u03bcM). The 2,6-dideoxy \u03b1-L-glycoside 3 (MIC 20\u201350\u00a0\u03bcM), chosen as the representative structure of this class of compounds, was found to selectively interact with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), present in bacterial membranes, versus phosphatidylcholine (PC), present in eukaryotic ones. When tested against the Gram-negative E. coli K12, compound 3 was not active per se (MIC 256\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), despite the 80% of PE in its inner membrane (IM) composition vs. the 43% reported for the membrane of B. cereus7. Yet, in E. coli K12 spheroplasts, where only the IM is left intact, a dramatic increase in inhibitory activity was observed (MIC 4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), suggesting a complete lack of outer membrane (OM) permeability for these glycosides, but a clear potential for use in PE-enriched membranes in conditions where the OM integrity is compromised6. Furthermore, likely because of the membrane-targeting MoA, compound 3 presented low susceptibility to common mechanisms of resistance against several antibiotics used in the clinical setting, including erythromycin, penicillin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline6, ultimately pointing towards a vast therapeutic potential of dodecyl deoxyglycosides against MDR bacteria\u2014one that is yet to be explored.Figure 1Structure of four dodecyl deoxyglycosides previously studied in Gram-positive bacteria6, and their role in the present work. Pink circles represent the locations where carbohydrate deoxygenation took place.\nDue to the presence of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-encompassing OM, Gram-negative bacteria are indeed less susceptible to antibiotic entrance compared to Gram-positive bacteria, in addition to being particularly prone to develop permeability-related AMR mechanisms8. Because of the disparity observed between IM and OM in terms of physicochemical characteristics, compounds that are able to pass through the IM are not likely to pass through the OM and vice-versa9. Therefore, creative solutions involving the concomitant use of more than one compound may often be required when it comes to the development of new antimicrobial strategies directed against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly when the goal is to repurpose antibiotics with demonstrated activity against Gram-positive organisms10. In this context, this study explores the potential of dodecyl deoxyglycoside leads against the critical priority Gram-negative pathogens CRAB, CRPA, and CRE, ultimately aiming to contribute to new solutions for the emerging AMR threat. We hypothesized that by using subtherapeutic concentrations of an adjuvant agent able to enhance OM permeability, our glycosides would then succeed at disrupting the IM and cause bacterial cell lysis through a concerted, membrane-exclusive MoA. Polymyxins B (PMB) and E (colistin) were chosen as adjuvant agents for a few reasons: (i) these are last-resort antibiotics approved for clinical use and listed among the critically important antibiotics for combating AMR11,12; (ii) they act by binding to the OM LPS lipids, thus increasing OM permeability, as required10; (iii) polymyxins and polymyxin analogs have been previously shown to potentiate the activity of several antibiotics13\u201315. However, while these antibiotics are important for combating antimicrobial resistance, they should be carefully considered due to their potential for neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Fortunately, these adverse effects are generally dose-dependent and typically reversible when the drug is discontinued early16. Moreover, there is evidence indicating that colistin does not appear to influence clinical outcomes or mortality, whether used alone or in combination17.\nIn addition to disclosing the lowest possible polymyxin concentration able to render the desired OM permeation, this study was also designed to identify the best glycoside among five reference structures for structural optimization. Besides the already described compounds 1 and 3, 4,6-dideoxy \u03b2-D-glycoside 2 (Fig.\u00a01) was chosen to provide a source of comparison between configuration \u03b1- vs. \u03b2- in O-glycosides against Gram-negative bacteria, since a huge disparity in activity between 1 and 2 has been reported in Gram-positive pathogens6. Furthermore, 2-deoxy \u03b1-D-glycoside 4 (Fig.\u00a01), which exhibits limited affinity towards PE6, was also included to corroborate the importance of the PE-related MoA of alkyl deoxyglycosides in Gram-negative bacteria, as well as to highlight the role of the 6-deoxygenation pattern in activity. Last but not least, due to the potential for improved metabolic stability of C-glycosides versus their O-glycoside analogs18 and previous evidence of C-glycoside efficacy in carbohydrate-based antibiotic development19,20, we envisioned the anomeric O\u2009\u2192\u2009C substitution in compound 1 to afford the more structurally robust \u03b1-glycoside 5 (Fig.\u00a02), obtained through a simultaneous deoxygenation procedure and herein reported for the first time.Figure 2Strategy for the development and application of the novel C-glycoside analogue 5 (of 1, from Fig.\u00a01) in the present work. Pink circles highlight the implemented anomeric O\u2009\u2192\u2009C substitution.\n\n## Synthesis\nEven though compounds 1 and 2 had previously been reported6,21, one of our goals was to further explore and optimize the construction of the desired 4,6-dideoxy pattern that was still offering significant potential for improvement. The synthesis started from the commercially available methyl \u03b1-D-glucopyranoside which, after 4,6-O-benzylidene introduction and subsequent benzylation of positions 2 and 3, rendered intermediate 6 in excellent yield (Fig.\u00a03). In previous work (Fig.\u00a02), selective benzylidene opening at position 4 in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride and molecular iodine was the first step in the reported sequential deoxygenation procedure21. After triflate introduction followed by reduction of position 4, the sugar donor was immediately glycosylated. It was only after full benzyl removal that the last deoxygenation step was conducted, taking advantage of the preferential reactivity of position 6 when compared to positions 2 and 3. However, this procedure required a total of seven reaction steps from compound 6 before the 4,6-dideoxy pattern could be achieved21. In the present work, we opted for a full benzylidene deprotection in mildly acidic conditions at 50 \u00baC, which afforded intermediate 7 in almost quantitative yield (Fig.\u00a03). Then, simultaneous triflation of positions 4 and 6, followed by reduction with tetrabutylammonium borohydride at 85 \u00baC gave the key intermediate 8 in 88% yield over two steps. We were hence able to access the target 4,6-dideoxy pattern in only three reaction steps, rendering the synthetic route toward the sugar donor for both O- and C-glycosylation much more concise, straightforward, and efficient.Figure 3Synthesis of 4,6-dideoxy key intermediate 8 through a simultaneous dideoxygenation approach. Reagents and conditions: (a) PhCH(OMe)2, p-TsOH\u00b7H2O, ACN, 82 \u00baC, 19\u00a0h, 91%; (b) NaH, BnBr, DMF, 0\u00baC to rt, 17\u00a0h, 91%; (c) AcOH 80%, 50 \u00baC, 24\u00a0h, 98%; (d) Tf2O, Py, DCM, 0 \u00baC, 6\u00a0h; (e) Tol, n-Bu4NBH4, 85 \u00baC, 1h30, 88% over two steps.\nFor the synthesis of compounds 1 and 2, intermediate 8 was O-glycosylated in the presence of dodecan-1-ol in acidic conditions, affording the inseparable anomeric mixture 9 in high yield (Fig.\u00a04A). As previously described21, debenzylation still did not enable the separation of 1 and 2. Therefore, the mixture was acetylated, the anomers separated by column chromatography, and Zempl\u00e9n deacetylation gave the desired products in good overall yields. Compounds 1 and 2 were successfully accessed through this new procedure with only eight reaction steps, in 25% and 17% overall yield, respectively, compared with 11 steps in the previously described route, which gave 1 and 2 in 11% and 5% overall yield, respectively.Figure 4(A) O- and (B) C-glycosylation reactions towards the synthesis of compounds 1, 2 and 5. Reagents and conditions: (A) (a) dodecan-1-ol, Ambertlyst 15, DCM, 40 \u00baC, 40\u00a0h, 93%; (b) Pd/C, EtSiH, MeOH, rt; (c) py, DMAP, Ac2O, rt, 4\u00a0h; (d) NaOMe, MeOH, rt, 1\u20132\u00a0h, 37% (compound 1) and 26% over three steps (compound 2); (B) (e) Ac2O/AcOH (1:1), H2SO4, 0 \u00baC, 20\u00a0h, 35% (compound 10);(f) Pd/C, H2, MeOH/EtOAc 1:1, rt, 2h30; (g) Ac2O/AcOH (1:1), H2SO4, 0 \u00baC, o.n.; (h) Ac2O, py, rt, 1h45, 90% over three steps (compound 11); (i) allyl trimethylsilane, BF3\u00b7OEt2, ACN, 0 \u00baC, 30\u00a0min-3\u00a0h, 91% (compound 12) and 86% (compound 13); (j) 2nd generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst, undec-1-ene, DCM, 40 \u00baC, 24\u00a0h; (k) Pd/C, H2, EtOAc, rt, 6-20\u00a0h; (l) NaOMe, MeOH, rt, 1\u00a0h, 56% (from compound 12) or 85% (from compound 13) over three steps.\nWhen it comes to C-glycosylation, intermediate 8 was first submitted to anomeric activation as previously described6. However, the use of strong acid in the attempted protocol for demethylation with concomitant acetylation led to a complex mixture of compounds, with 10 (Fig. 4B) being identified as the major product (35% yield) as a result of selective debenzylation and acetylation at position 3. After coming across such a low yield for a supposedly straightforward activation step, we decided to explore more efficient alternatives, starting with the full debenzylation of 8 prior to anomeric activation. Thus, catalytic dehydrogenation followed by acid-promoted demethylation was conducted, after which full acetylation in the presence of acetic anhydride and pyridine gave compound 11 in 90% yield over three steps. At this point, it became clear that the switch from benzyl to acetate groups was a requirement for efficient anomeric activation. We, therefore, pondered the use of the 2,3-di-O-acetyl-4,6-O-benzylidene precursor S1 (see Supplementary Fig. S1 online) as the starting material. Given the incompatibility of acetate protection with hydride-donor reagents such as the one used in the synthesis of 8, an alternative route towards 11 relying on sequential iodination of positions 4 and 6 through the Garegg method22 followed by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of a base23 was explored. Yet, due to the extent of this procedure compared to the above-described simultaneous 4,6-dideoxygenation, anomeric activation starting from the benzyl-protected intermediate 8 still proved to be more efficient.\nFor comparison purposes, C-glycosylation of both 10 and 11 was carried out in parallel. The use of boron trifluoride etherate in the presence of allyl trimethylsilane6 at 0 \u00baC gave the allyl \u03b1-C-glycosides 12 and 13, respectively, in equally high yields (Fig.\u00a04B). Then, a chain-elongation metathesis reaction catalysed by the 2nd Generation Grubbs-Hoveyda catalyst in the presence of undec-1-ene6 followed by catalytic hydrogenation and deacetylation afforded, in both cases, the final compound 5 in moderate and good yields, respectively. All in all, the synthesis of this new C-glycoside was found to be significantly more efficient through intermediate 11 (47% overall yield over 12 reaction steps) than through intermediate 10 (13% overall yield over 10 steps), regardless of the two additionally required reaction steps. Of note, compounds 3 and 4 were synthesized according to the previously described methodology6.\n\n## Antibacterial activity\nGlycosides and glycoside-adjuvant combinations were evaluated against two well-characterized Gram-negative strains for validation of our study: the antibiotic-susceptible E. coli ATCC 25922, and the colistin-resistant E. coli NCTC 13846 strains. We then set a panel of six carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates as test strains, all of which are part of the Portuguese National Reference Laboratory for Antibiotic Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infections (NRL-AR/HAI, INSA) collection. These comprise several colistin-susceptible Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens (K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa) expressing different types of carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes, including OXA-48, NDM-1, KPC-3, IMP-1 and GES-12. Most of these strains are also resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, with the complete antibiotic susceptibility and resistance profiles being presented in Supplementary Table S1 online. All test strains were susceptible to both colistin and PMB with a MIC value of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL or 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (P. aeruginosa CQ4924). Based on the reported concentration-dependent polymyxin-LPS electrostatic interactions leading to OM permeation24\u201326, we envisioned that polymyxin concentrations lower than the MIC would be sufficient to enhance OM permeability to our glycosides without causing significant inhibition in bacterial cell growth. Furthermore, subtherapeutic polymyxin concentrations have been described to enhance OM permeability in Gram-negative bacteria without interfering with IM integrity27. Therefore, the maximum polymyxin concentration for glycoside-polymyxin combination assays was established at the first two-fold dilution of the maximum MIC, i.e., 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Of note, MIC values for the colistin-resistant control strain (E. coli NCTC 13846) were, as anticipated, significantly higher (4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL; Table 1) compared to the remaining bacteria, which should result in complete glycoside inactivity for the maximum used polymyxin concentration of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.Table 1MIC (\u03bcg/mL) values for both polymyxins used in this study as adjuvant agents against several critical priority carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates.

All in all, with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of colistin (Fig.\u00a05A), both colistin-susceptible control (strain A) and test strains (strains C-H) were susceptible to glycoside-polymyxin combinations, with MIC values ranging from\u2009\u2264\u20090.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to 3.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in the most colistin-susceptible pathogens (strains C-G) and from 3.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to 6.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in P. aeruginosa CQ4924 (strain H). For all test strains except for the latter, the use of colistin at the MIC can merely rule out significant antagonistic effects between glycosides and the permeabilizing agent that would potentially hinder its ability to interact with the LPS and interfere with OM integrity. The close-to-zero MIC values observed throughout test strains (in most cases\u2009\u2264\u20090.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) indicate that these glycosides should generally be unable to interfere with the MoA of colistin to a significant extent, with compounds 2 and 5 clearly presenting the potential for additive or synergistic effects (see Supplementary Table S1 online). In fact, by calculating the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI) (Table 2)28\u201330, we were able to assert with more detail that these two glycosides act synergistically with colistin in E. cloacae CQ1941 (strain D) and A. baumannii CQ4322 (strain G), and additively in the remaining test strains.Figure 5Heatmaps of MIC values for compounds 1\u20135 in the presence of (A) 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, (B) 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and (C) 0.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of colistin against critical priority carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates.

Given that 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL corresponds to half of the MIC value of colistin against CRPA CQ4924 (and therefore to a concentration that should be unable to cause inhibition of bacterial growth per se in this strain), our results suggest, on the other hand, that compounds 2, 3 and 5 were able to effectively penetrate the OM and induce IM lysis \u2014 particularly 3 and 5, which exhibited the lowest MIC (3.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). It is important to highlight that, according to the previously established MoA for these types of compounds6, the high IM PE levels displayed by Gram-negative bacteria (60\u201382%7), which can furthermore be upregulated in the presence of low colistin concentrations31, should be the core factor enabling the effective targeting of the IM, and could furthermore justify the five-fold lower MIC values vs. those reported in Gram-positive pathogens (e.g. 16\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for compound 3 in B. cereus ATCC 145796, exhibiting 43% of PE in the membrane7). Moreover, these glycosides were not active per se (i.e. in the absence of polymyxins) in any of the eight tested bacterial strains (MIC\u2009>\u2009100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, see Supplementary Tables S3and S4 online), thus validating our concept that antimicrobial activity in Gram-negative bacteria is observed due to polymyxin-induced OM permeabilization. As expected, the colistin-resistant E. coli NCTC 13846 (strain B; colistin-resistant control) was not susceptible to any of the tested antibiotic combinations.\nIt is interesting to note the activity observed for \u03b2-O-glycoside 2 in light of the lack of antimicrobial effects previously reported for this compound in Gram-positive bacteria6. Rather than an intrinsic inability of the \u03b2-anomer to interact with PE and act as a bactericide, this result strongly points towards other factors contributing to its divergent behaviour when encountering variations in the bacterial cell envelope from Gram-positive to Gram-negative pathogens. We postulate that one possible explanation for this result could be related to target inaccessibility due to enzymatic liability. Indeed, being a \u03b2-O-glycoside, 2 should display a naturally higher susceptibility to hydrolysis by enzymes with \u03b2-glycosidase activity when compared with its \u03b1 analogue (1). If, on the one hand, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria redundantly express cell wall-associated enzymes required for the cleavage of \u03b2-1,4 glycosidic bonds between MurNAc and GlcNAc peptidoglycan units32, on the other hand, the regulation of such enzymes may widely vary among types of bacteria and environmental factors33,34. Consequently, in case 2 is a substrate of one or more of these peptidoglycan-recycling enzymes, the compound could indeed reach the IM to a lower extent in bacteria with higher rates of cell wall remodeling and turnover.\nAs for glycoside 4, it was found to be inactive against P. aeruginosa CQ4924 when combined with colistin at 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (Fig.\u00a05A), pointing towards the inability of this 2-deoxy glycoside to inhibit bacterial cell growth even in conditions that favour OM permeabilization. This inability was indeed confirmed when the colistin concentration was lowered to 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (Fig.\u00a05B), rendering 4 fully inactive even against the antibiotic-susceptible E. coli ATCC 25922 (control strain A).\nTaken together, the results for compounds 1\u20133 and 5 (Fig.\u00a05B), demonstrate that colistin 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL is sufficient for OM permeabilization in all test strains except for P. aeruginosa CQ4924 (strain H). Under these conditions, however, compounds 1\u20133 failed to be active against K. pneumoniae CQ1947 (strain F), an IMP-1-producing MDR clinical isolate. K. pneumoniae is the most common pathogen causing bloodstream infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and peritonitis, being typically associated with infections occurring in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients35,36. In the early 2000s, an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in the United States marked the onset of the CRE epidemic37. In Portugal, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were reported in 201038, suggesting a relatively rapid importation of CRE strains to the European continent. Indeed, these remain a threat to public health to this day: with limited treatment options, patients infected with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae are at a significantly higher risk of in-hospital death and poorer health outcomes than those infected with carbapenem-sensitive K. pneumoniae39, which urgently calls for the identification and development of new antibiotic approaches against K. pneumoniae strains expressing carbapenemases. Despite the results for compounds 1\u20133, we were pleased to find that, with a subtherapeutic colistin concentration of 0.25\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, C-glycoside 5 exhibited antimicrobial activity against all three carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates tested, including the IMP-1-producing strain CQ1947 (strain F). This result already denotes a positive impact of the O\u2009\u2192\u2009C bioisosteric replacement from 1 to 5 on the antimicrobial activity of alkyl 4,6-dideoxy-\u03b1-D-xylo glycosides, and highlights the potential of compound 5 as a lead for further development against CRE.\nUsing a colistin concentration fourfold lower than the MIC, both K. pneumoniae CQ1942 (strain E)\u00a0and K. pneumoniae\u00a0CQ1947 (strain F) became non-susceptible to any of the glycosides (Fig.\u00a05C). Yet, 0.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL was sufficient to allow the entry of compounds 2 and 5 through the OM of K. pneumoniae CQ4921 (strain C), E. cloacae CQ1941 (strain D) and A. baumannii CQ4322 (strain G), which promoted visible antibacterial effects (MIC 3.1\u201325\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Notably, the OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae CQ4921 is not only susceptible to imipenem upon increased exposure but is also susceptible to ciprofloxacin and aminoglycoside antibiotics, contrarily to the above-mentioned imipenem-resistant CQ1942 (KPC-3-producing) and CQ1947 (IMP-1-producing) strains (see Supplementary Table S1 online). Hence, even though all three strains are colistin-susceptible, our results reflect a higher sensitivity of the more susceptible K. pneumoniae CQ4921 to colistin-LPS interactions than the remaining two less susceptible K. pneumoniae strains. Moreover, to our surprise, the \u03b2 configuration (2) of alkyl 4,6-dideoxy-D-xylo O-glycosides seems to be more beneficial to activity at low colistin concentrations than the \u03b1 configuration (1).\nAs part of the CRE epidemic37,38, the reported rise in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in the last decade40 is accompanied by an increase in the rate of nosocomial infections caused by carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae as well41. The expression of the New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) has been described as one of the most common carbapenem resistance-associated mechanisms in this type of bacteria41\u201344, which is captured by E. cloacae CQ1941 (strain D), used in the present study. This strain is not only resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides, but also to the synthetic monobactam aztreonam (see Supplementary Table S1 online), which is still seen as a valid bet for pharmaceutical investment. Indeed, aztreonam is currently under Phase 3 trials in combination with avibactam for the treatment of serious infections caused by carbapenemase-producing MDR Gram-negative pathogens for which available therapeutic options are limited45. With a MIC of 3.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, C-glycoside 5 has the potential to be further explored against this aztreonam-resistant CRE strain when combined with colistin at 0.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, while O-glycoside 2 was significantly less active in the same conditions (MIC of 12\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) (Fig.\u00a05C).\nIn contrast, 2 was significantly more active against the GES-12-producing A. baumannii CQ4322 (strain G) than 5, in spite of the higher MIC value observed (6.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). In addition to CRPA and CRE, CRAB was also included in our MDR Gram-negative pathogen panel for being a top-priority pathogen in urgent need of novel antibiotic development, with frequent healthcare-associated outbreaks leading to high mortality rates in critically ill patients4,46. Hence, even though lead 5 seems to be the most promising glycoside of the series overall, lead 2 may offer a relevant alternative to cover a wider spectrum of pathogens and different carbapenem resistance mechanisms, and thus should also be further explored.\nIt is worth mentioning that 0.06\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of colistin led to OM permeabilization in the antibiotic-susceptible control strain E. coli ATCC 25922, but not in either of the carbapenem-resistant test strains (see Supplementary Table S3 online). A colistin concentration of 0.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL can, therefore, be established as the lowest subtherapeutic colistin dilution with observable OM-permeabilizing effects in MDR Gram-negative pathogens with a MIC of colistin of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (strains C, D and G), while 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL is the lowest subtherapeutic colistin dilution capable of such effects in CRPA CQ4929 (strain H), which has a MIC of colistin of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (Table 1).\nTo corroborate the bactericide MoA that was previously proposed for this class of glycosides, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was also determined for the best compounds in combination with colistin at 0.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Since the MBC of compounds 2 and 5 was either equal to or just one dilution higher than the MIC (Table 3), we conclude that these compounds are, indeed, bactericides in Gram-negative bacteria when in the presence of an OM-permeabilizing agent. This is in alignment with previous evidence supporting a bactericidal MoA of alkyl deoxyglycosides in Gram-positive bacteria6.Table 3MIC and MBC (\u03bcg/mL) values for the best compounds in combination with colistin against critical priority carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates.
