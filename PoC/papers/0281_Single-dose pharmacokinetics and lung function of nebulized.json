  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Niclosamide is approved as an oral anthelminthic, but its low oral bioavailability hinders its medical use requiring high drug exposure outside the gastrointestinal tract. An optimized solution of niclosamide for nebulization and intranasal administration using the ethanolamine salt has been developed and tested in a Phase 1 trial. In this study we investigate the pulmonary exposure of niclosamide following administration via intravenous injection, oral administration or nebulization. METHODS: We characterized the plasma and pulmonary pharmacokinetics of three ascending doses of nebulized niclosamide in sheep, compare it to intravenous niclosamide for compartmental PK modelling, and to the human equivalent approved 2 g oral dose to investigate in the pulmonary exposure of different niclosamide delivery routes. Following a single-dose administration to five sheep, niclosamide concentrations were determined in plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF). Non-compartmental and compartmental modeling was used to characterize pharmacokinetic profiles. Lung function tests were performed in all dose groups. RESULTS: Administration of all niclosamide doses were well tolerated with no adverse changes in lung function tests. Plasma pharmacokinetics of nebulized niclosamide behaved dose-linear and was described by a 3-compartmental model estimating an absolute bioavailability of 86%. ELF peak concentration and area under the curve was 578 times and 71 times higher with nebulization of niclosamide relative to administration of oral niclosamide. CONCLUSIONS: Single local pulmonary administration of niclosamide via nebulization was well tolerated in sheep and resulted in substantially higher peak ELF concentration compared to the human equivalent oral 2 g dose.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nNiclosamide is a salicylanilide introduced in the 1960s as oral chewable tablets to treat tapeworm infections [1,\u00a02]. Niclosamide has been subject to many repurposing studies demonstrating therapeutically relevant activities across a wide range of indications ranging from metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases and, cancer to pulmonary conditions and infections [3].\nThe major challenge with repurposing niclosamide using the oral chewable tablets for these indications is its low oral bioavailability and poor solubility, and rapid metabolism in the liver which limits systemic absorption and distribution to tissues outside the gastrointestinal tract and excretory organs [4,\u00a05]. The oral bioavailability has been reported as 5% - 10% in rats and 0.5% in dogs [6,\u00a07]. Furthermore, two clinical trials using oral niclosamide in a few adult cancer patients reported variable systemic concentrations ranging from 665-759 ng/mL (5 patients receiving 2 g/day) and 35.7-182 ng/mL (3 patients receiving 1.5g/day) with dose limiting toxicities being observed when higher doses than the approved 2 g/day were used [8,\u00a09]. Recently published data from a Phase 2 trial with oral niclosamide in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 did not meet its primary endpoints using the approved 2 g oral dose, although there was a trend towards reduced viral loads in fecal shedders of the active arm [10]. This study is consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of niclosamide, when administered orally as a 2 g dose, is restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, highlighting the need for novel delivery approaches for indications with pathology beyond the gastrointestinal system.\nTo explore the potential of niclosamide for treatment of infections of the lower and upper respiratory system, local delivery may be preferred over other routes if a high local concentration can be achieved while limiting systemic exposure and toxicity. Several groups have attempted the reformulation of niclosamide for pulmonary administration. Brunaugh et al. developed a dry powder formulation of niclosamide by encapsulating niclosamide in human-lysozyme and showed improved survival and significant reduction in lung viral titers when administered intranasally to SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infected mice [11]. A subsequent pharmacokinetic (PK) study by Jara et al. in which the same formulation was administered via inhalation in rats (~0.8 mg/kg) and hamsters (0.14-0.29 mg/kg) found peak concentrations of 20-205 ng/g and 20.5-37.2 \u03bcg/g in lung tissue, respectively [12]. This dry powder formulation has progressed to clinical trials, with a completed Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers showing that inhalation of 0.5, 2 and 6 mg niclosamide was well tolerated, with no dose limiting cough or irritation observed [13]. No lung pharmacokinetics were reported. Costabile et al. administered a niclosamide nanosuspension (10 - 100\u03bcg) intratracheally to Wistar rats and found no signs of acute toxicity or lung injury despite mild to moderate infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at the highest dose [14], that may have been mediated by exposure to niclosamide or vehicle.\nUNION therapeutics has developed an optimized solution of niclosamide for nebulization and intranasal administration using the ethanolamine salt which has been tested and found to be well tolerated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers [15].\nHere we show the pharmacokinetics of niclosamide in plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) coupled with lung function assessment in sheep, a recognized large animal model with a pulmonary anatomy similar to humans [16\u201318], following nebulization of a 0.167%, 0.5% and 1% niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN) solution. Nebulized NEN doses were chosen to reflect the dose ranges used in the Phase 1 trial [15]. Nebulized NEN was compared to intravenous NEN for development of a compartmental population pharmacokinetic model to determine nebulized bioavailability, and oral niclosamide to compare niclosamide ELF concentrations following nebulized NEN to the human equivalent approved 2 g oral dose.\n\n## Animals\nMerino cross-bred female sheep (n=10 ewes) used in this study were sourced from a commercial livestock supplier. All sheep were treated orally with anthelminthic to eliminate any worm parasites (in line with standard management practices) and received standard flock health vaccinations prior to delivery to the Monash Animal Research Platform Facility at Monash University. Upon arrival, sheep were acclimatized for at least 5 days before study commencement, rotated between small group pen housing and metabolic cages under controlled ambient conditions (20-22\u00b0C) and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle throughout the experimental period. For nebulization administration and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) sampling, sheep were positioned in a specialized harness to restrict movement of head and neck. An intravenous catheter (Angiocath 16 g 3.25 in, Becton Dickinson) was inserted into the jugular vein prior to the commencement of experimentation, was maintained on a daily basis and used throughout the duration of the experimental period. All sheep were 12 months of age and had a weight of 25-35 kg. The animal study received approval from the Federation University Australia/Monash University animal ethics committees (19-007).\n\n## Niclosamide Preparations and Dosing Schedule\nNiclosamide was administered via nebulization, intravenous (IV) and oral route of delivery. Three different formulation strengths were used for nebulization: 0.167 %, 0.5 % and 1 % NEN solution (w/v) as well as a placebo solution containing only the vehicle of the 1% NEN solution. A 0.1% NEN solution was used for IV administration (10-fold dilution of the 1% NEN solution in saline prior to administration). Niclosamide for oral dosing was prepared by crushing the commercially available tablet formulation (Yomesan\u00ae, 500 mg tablet, Bayer [2]) and dispersing it in 20 mL sterile water to a final dose similar to the approved oral 2 g human dose on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis (Table I).Table IDose and administration route per dose group and corresponding sampling times of BALF and blood samplesExperiment(n = 5)Dose GroupAdministration routeDoseSampling timesBALFSampling timesBlood1(Sheep #1 -5)1Nebulization1% Placebo Solution--2Nebulization6mL, 0.167% NEN10 mg NEN- 0 h (predose)- 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 4 h, 8 h (after completion of dosing)- 0 h (predose)- 7.5 min, 15 min (during dosing)- 0, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h (after completion of dosing)3Nebulization6mL, 0.5% NEN30 mg NEN4Nebulization6mL, 1% NEN60 mg NEN2(Sheep #11-14,18)5Oral1132 mg1- 0 h (predose)-0, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h (after completion of dosing)6Intravenous3mL, 0.1% NEN3 mg NEN- 0 h (predose)- 7.5 min, 15 min (during dosing)- 0, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h (after completion of dosing)NEN = Niclosamide ethanolamine.1 corresponds to the human equivalent dose of the 2g human oral dose based on a mg/kg and a mg/m2 basis, assuming a 60 kg human weight and 34 kg sheep weight. For the mg/m2 conversion a km of 32 and 37 was used for sheep and human, respectively (according to FDA guidance for Industry: Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers). The actual delivered dose was 1132 mg niclosamide (mean) as on average 27.88 \u00b1 1.64 mg/kg were delivered to a 40.6 \u00b1 2.1 kg sheep.\nAll sheep were fasted for 12-24 h prior to drug treatment. For each dose group, a single dose was administered followed by a 7 day \u201cwash out\u201d period prior to the next dose (see Table I for order of doses). In Experiment 1, five sheep were allocated to dose group 1-4 in an ascending dose manner. In Experiment 2, a separate cohort of 5 sheep were allocated to dose group 5 and 6 where a single dose was also administered with a 7 day \u201cwash-out\u201d period (Table I). The IV arm was included to understand the absolute bioavailability of niclosamide and the oral arm to compare exposure in the ELF following oral administration versus the nebulized route.\n\n## Niclosamide administration procedures\nAll dosing procedures were performed while experimental subjects were fully awake, and judged to be in good health. The actual delivered dose (mg/kg), delivery time and droplet size distribution, where applicable, are summarized for each dose group in Table S1\u00a0(supplementary information).\nFor nebulized niclosamide dosing, aerosol delivery was performed as previously described in a closed respiratory loop [16,\u00a017]. Briefly, a lubricated cuffed endotracheal tube (Portex, 7.0-8.00 mm internal diameter) was inserted via the nasal passage into the trachea and attached to a dual phase control respirator (Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) (20 breaths/min, 50% inspiration). Filters (Hudson, RCI, NC, USA) were placed in the expiratory line, and together with all intubation lines and nebulizer components, were removed following completion of dosing and rinsed with 50 mL MilliQ Water to determine any residual drug and allow calculation of the actual dose. The three different NEN solutions (6 mL) were administered via the investigational eFlow Inline Nebulizer manufactured by PARI Pharma GmbH. The niclosamide aerosols generated from the nebulizers exhibited a D50 droplet size (Malvern Spraytec, Malvern PanAnalytical, Bristol, UK) of 3.38 \u03bcm \u00b1 0.26 \u03bcm and were delivered within a mean timeframe of 24-27 min per dosing treatment. The actual delivered dose (mg/kg), nebulization time and droplet size distribution are summarized for each dose group in Table S1 (supplementary information).\nFor oral niclosamide delivery, an established procedure [19,\u00a020] (with slight modifications) was used for closure of the reticular groove in sheep to enable oral drug delivery directly into the abomasum or true stomach. Briefly, this involved oral delivery of 10% CuSO4 (w/v) solution (in 20 mL sterile water) to stimulate closure of the reticular groove, via a feeding tube (7 mm internal diameter) that was inserted through the nasal passage into the esophagus. CuSO4 was immediately followed by delivery of the niclosamide suspension made from crushed tablets (in 20 mL sterile water) followed by a glucose \u2018chaser\u2019 (300 mL glucose solution (25% w/v)). The glucose solution allowed verification that each oral dose was successfully delivered to the abomasum (true stomach) and subsequently absorbed via the intestine (blood glucose concentrations measured at 15 min and 30 min post-dosing confirmed direct delivery into the abomasum; see supplementary information, Fig. S1).\nFor IV administration, 3 mL of a 0.1% NEN solution was administered via an infusion pump and IV catheter (inserted into the jugular vein) at a rate of 0.1 mL/min for 30 min.\n\n## Lung function assessments\nLung function measurements were undertaken in awake, consciously breathing sheep, immediately after and again at 24 h following each dosing (for up to 10 min on each occasion), according to established protocols [16]. Lung parameters were derived from averaged measures of five measured epochs of five breaths and data analyzed using LabChart\u2122 software. Comparison of lung function parameters pre \u2013 and postdosing were compared using paired Student\u2019s T-test.\n\n## Sampling\nPeripheral blood and BALF samples were obtained from all sheep in all dose groups except the placebo group according to the sampling schedule in Table I. Peripheral blood samples (14 time-points over 12 h) were collected from a cannulated jugular vein into K3EDTA containers (BD Biosciences), and plasma samples stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. BALF samples (6 time-points) were collected by intra-lung infusion of 25 mL saline via a catheter through the biopsy port of the bronchoscope into separate lung segments/lobes: 0 h (right apical lobe), 5 min (left middle), 30 min (right caudal), 1 h (left caudal), 4 h (right middle), 8 h (left apical) [16,\u00a017]. Cell-free BALF samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until analysis. Mean BALF recovery was 9.28 \u00b1 1.72 mL with no significant differences across the 6 sampled lobes. Blood and BALF sampling times were overlapping to allow back calculation of ELF dilution to estimate drug concentration in the ELF using the urea correction method [18]. Urea concentrations were measured in BALF and plasma samples using a commercial plate-based assay according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions (LTS-EIA-BUN, Thermo Fisher, Waltham USA). Actual collection times were recorded for compartmental population pharmacokinetic modelling.\n\n## Quantification of Niclosamide in Biological Samples\nNiclosamide was quantified in plasma and BALF using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method (Shimadzu 8050 triple quadrupole instrument coupled with Shimadzu Nexera X2 UHPLC). Linearity was confirmed in the range of 0.5 ng/mL \u2013 500 ng/mL for plasma samples and 0.5 \u2013 1000 ng/mL for BALF samples. One BALF sample was diluted 1:1 with blank BALF to bring it into the range of the standard curve. The niclosamide concentrations in ELF were estimated according to the urea correction as previously described by Landersdorfer et al. [18].\n\n## Non-compartmental and compartmental Pharmacokinetic analysis\nPKSolver add-in for Excel was used for non-compartmental analysis of plasma pharmacokinetic data. Due to variable and sparse ELF concentrations, ELF AUCs were calculated using trapezoidal calculations in excel. GraphPad Prism Version 9.1.2. was used for visualization.\nCompartmental population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling of niclosamide following IV and nebulized dosing was conducted via non-linear mixed-effects modelling. The first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCE+I) algorithm in NONMEM\u00ae Version 7.2 (ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD) was utilized for modelling. R scripts were utilized for generation of model evaluation plots using RStudio Version 1.1.463 (RStudio, Inc.).\nModels containing one, two and three disposition compartments were evaluated. Niclosamide concentrations in plasma from all sheep and all dose levels were modelled simultaneously. Models incorporating linear, non-linear and parallel linear and non-linear elimination were evaluated. The systemic bioavailability of niclosamide following nebulized administration was estimated, assuming that the systemic elimination and distribution of niclosamide were similar for IV and nebulized dosing. Models including different absorption rate constants and/or different extents of bioavailability following nebulized dosing for the different dose levels were tested. A log-normal distribution was used to describe the interindividual variability of the PK estimates. Models with and without covariance between clearance and volume of distribution were evaluated. The residual unexplained variability for niclosamide in plasma was described by a combined proportional and additive error model.\nFor model evaluation, plots of observed versus individual-fitted and observed versus population-fitted niclosamide concentrations (supplementary information, Fig. S2), conditional weighted residuals, the normalized prediction distribution error and the NONMEM objective function were utilized. For each model evaluated, NONMEM computed the minimum value of the objective function, a statistic equivalent to minus twice the log likelihood (-2LL). The log-likelihood ratio was used to compare two nested (hierarchical) models, and \u0394\u22122LL was the change in \u22122LL (i.e. the NONMEM objective function value) relative to the comparator model. The best-fit model displayed the lowest objective function value. A reduction in the objective function by more than the critical value of 3.84 units (\u0394df =1 for one added degree of freedom) represented a statistically significant improvement in model fit (chi2 distribution, p<0.05). In addition to the statistical model selection criteria, the plausibility of the parameter estimates was considered.\nThe final model to describe the plasma PK following IV and nebulized dosing simultaneously was a 3-compartment disposition model with linear (non-saturable) elimination clearance and linear (first-order) absorption, with interindividual variability on clearance, central volume of distribution, volume of distribution of the shallow peripheral compartment and the absorption rate constant. The model well described the observed concentrations across all sheep and dose levels and both routes of administration.\nThe amount of niclosamide in the absorption compartment (Aabs) was described as:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{dA_{abs}}{dt}={Input}_{neb}\\hbox{--} {k}_{\\alpha}\\bullet {A}_{abs}$$\\end{document}dAabsdt=Inputneb--k\u03b1\u2219Aabs\nwhere Inputneb was the dose administration via nebulization modelled as a time-delimited zero-order, i.e. constant-rate, input and ka was the first-order absorption rate constant from the absorption compartment to the systemic circulation.\nThe amount of niclosamide in the central compartment (A1) was described as:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{\\textrm{dA}1}{\\textrm{dt}}=\\kern0.5em {k}_{\\alpha}\\bullet {F}_{neb}\\bullet {A}_{abs}+{Input}_{IV}- CL\\bullet C1\\hbox{--} {CL}_{d1}\\bullet C1+{CL}_{d1}\\bullet C2-{CL}_{d2}\\bullet C1+{CL}_{d2}\\bullet C3$$\\end{document}dA1dt=k\u03b1\u2219Fneb\u2219Aabs+InputIV-CL\u2219C1--CLd1\u2219C1+CLd1\u2219C2-CLd2\u2219C1+CLd2\u2219C3\nwhere Fneb was the bioavailability following nebulized dosing, InputIV was the dose administration via IV infusion that was modelled as a time-delimited zero-order, i.e. constant-rate, input, CL was the systemic elimination clearance, C1 was the concentration in the central compartment, CLd1 was the distribution clearance between the central and the shallow peripheral compartment, C2 was the concentration in the shallow peripheral compartment, CLd2 was the distribution clearance between the central and the deep peripheral compartment and C3 was the concentration in the deep peripheral compartment.\nThe amount of niclosamide in the shallow peripheral compartment (A2) was described as\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{\\textrm{dA}2}{\\textrm{dt}}=\\kern0.5em {CL}_{d1}\\bullet C1\\hbox{--} {CL}_{d1}\\bullet C2$$\\end{document}dA2dt=CLd1\u2219C1--CLd1\u2219C2\nThe amount of niclosamide in the deep peripheral compartment (A3) was described as\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{\\textrm{dA}3}{\\textrm{dt}}=\\kern0.5em {CL}_{d2}\\bullet C1\\hbox{--} {CL}_{d2}\\bullet C3$$\\end{document}dA3dt=CLd2\u2219C1--CLd2\u2219C3\n\n## Lung function tests following nebulized, IV and oral niclosamide\nLung function parameters were assessed in 5 animals before (pre-) and after (post-) nebulized, IV and oral niclosamide administration (Fig. 1). Following nebulized administration, no significant changes in transpulmonary pressures (airway resistance) or tidal volumes were observed. There was a transient increase in ventilation and breathing frequency seen in the period immediately following dosing (Fig. 1C and D), which likely led to the brief shift observed in the dynamic compliance index (Fig. 1E). For the IV and oral doses, no significant difference was observed in mean transpulmonary pressures (airway resistance) or dynamic compliance before (pre-) and after (post-) dose administration. Across all dose groups, niclosamide was well tolerated as no adverse signs were observed.Fig. 1Lung function assessment before and after administration of nebulized placebo, nebulized and intravenous niclosamide ethanolamine, and oral niclosamide.

Neb. = Nebulized, NEN = niclosamide ethanolamine, Nic = Niclosamide, IV = intravenous. Lung function assessment was performed at 5 min and not 10 min postdosing for the 0.167% NEN and 0.5% NEN treatment arm.\n\n## Plasma Pharmacokinetics of niclosamide after nebulized administration\nMean single doses of 0.27 mg/kg (0.167%), 0.76 mg/kg (0.5%) and 1.40 mg/kg (1%) NEN were administered nebulized over 24 to 27 min. Following nebulization of NEN, the apparent plasma Cmax of niclosamide was reached immediately post-dosing in all three dose strengths with peak concentrations of 76.7, 239.8 and 577.1 ng/mL, respectively. Thereafter, there was a rapid decline in niclosamide concentrations over the first 2 h post-dose for all three dose strengths, with numerous plasma concentrations reaching levels close or below the LLOQ of 0.5 ng/mL at 1 to 2 h post-dose (Fig. 2A). Plasma pharmacokinetics of niclosamide following a single intravenous infusion of 0.1% NEN, which was used to estimate nebulized bioavailability in the compartmental model, followed similar kinetics as the 0.167% nebulized dose reaching low plasma concentrations at 1 h post-dose (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Pharmacokinetics of niclosamide following nebulization in sheep. A Time-course profile of plasma concentration of niclosamide following nebulization of 0.167%, 0.5% and 1% niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN) solution and 0.1% NEN solution via intravenous administration on linear (left panel) and semilog scale (right panel). Eight datapoints from individual sheep were excluded in non-compartmental analysis and are not shown here as they could not be explained by protocol deviation and disagreed with basic pharmacokinetic principles but are displayed in Fig. S4 in the supplementary\u00a0information. B Pearson correlation of mean plasma Cmax of the three nebulized doses of this study to mean plasma Cmax of dose-matched cohorts of Phase 1 trial by Backer et al. [15]. r = pearson correlation coefficient. Mean \u00b1 SEM displayed.

D\u00a0Area-under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) of niclosamide in ELF following nebulized NEN versus the human equivalent 2 g oral dose (corresponding to 1132 mg niclosamide). For panel A, C, D mean \u00b1 SEM is displayed, and data is from n=5 sheep per group. LLOQ = lower limit of quantification.\nThe plasma pharmacokinetic profile of niclosamide was characterized by short half-lives in the alpha- and beta-phases (0.041 h and 0.2 h, respectively) and a substantially longer elimination half-life of 14 h.\nThe final population pharmacokinetic model describing the plasma pharmacokinetics following IV and nebulized dosing simultaneously was a 3-compartment disposition model with linear (non-saturable) elimination clearance and linear (first-order) absorption (see goodness of fit plots in Fig. S2 in supplementary information). The population mean bioavailability of nebulized NEN was estimated to be high at 86% (Table II). Furthermore, all modelling results indicated linearity in absorption and systemic plasma pharmacokinetics of niclosamide following nebulization in the tested dose ranges of 10 to 60 mg NEN (see Fig. S3). Non-compartmental plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of nebulized NEN are summarized in Table II. The estimates of the fixed and random effects of the population pharmacokinetics are reported in Table II and S2. To inform the translatability of absorption kinetics of niclosamide from the sheep model to human, we correlated the observed peak plasma concentration of niclosamide to that reported in the completed Phase 1 trial, in a dose-matched manner [15] (in Backer et al., combination of nebulization + intranasal administration was used). Precisely, we correlated the mean Cmax of cohort 2, 3, 4 of the Phase 1 trial to the mean Cmax of Group 2, 3 ,4 of this study; in both studies, identical amounts of NEN were nebulized (single doses of 10, 30 and 60 mg). Of note, all three cohorts of the Phase 1 trial included an additional low amount of NEN administered intranasally (3 mg in all three cohorts) whose contribution to the overall plasma exposure is however thought to be negligible and was therefore excluded in the correlation. That is likely because i) plasma exposure is mainly driven by the larger nebulized dose via the lungs having a larger surface area and ii) plasma pharmacokinetics in the Phase 1 trial behaved dose-linear with an increasing nebulized dose while the intranasally administered dose remained identical.Table IINon-Compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters of niclosamide in plasma and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) following nebulization and oral administration.

NEN = niclosamide ethanolamine salt, ND = not determined, Cmax = maximum concentration, Tmax = time to peak concentration, AUC = Area under the curve, k\u03b1 = absorption rate constant (estimated by population pharmacokinetic model).

T1/2\u03b2 = half-life of \u03b2 phase.\nWe found significant correlation in peak niclosamide plasma concentrations in human and sheep within the dose ranges of 10-60 mg, with a correlation coefficient r of 0.9987 (Pearson Correlation, p = 0.03) (Fig. 2B). This data suggests that the sheep model describes accurately the absorption kinetics of nebulized NEN in humans.\n\n## Epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentration following nebulized niclosamide ethanolamine\nIn contrast to dose-linearity in niclosamide plasma PK, indicating dose-dependent disposition from the lungs after nebulization, the ELF concentration did not behave dose-linear, with the Cmax and AUC being similar across the three nebulized doses (Fig. 2C and Table II). We further observed that some ELF concentrations within the time-course of sampling could not be calculated due to the measured BALF being below LLOQ. These observations disagreed with basic pharmacokinetic principles and thus may rather reflect technical challenges in the recovery of niclosamide in BALF. Furthermore, significant interindividual variability was observed in each dose group. Thus, an ELF pharmacokinetic model could not be established based on the current data due to the lack of a relationship between dose amount and ELF concentrations and only non-compartmental analysis was used to estimate Cmax and AUC.\nNiclosamide ELF Cmax and AUC was substantially higher compared to plasma following nebulization, with a partition coefficient KpELF:Plasma remaining high over time (Table II); Kp was approximately at 70 (5 min) and 122 (1-2 h) (1% NEN plasma data used for calculation). Niclosamide ELF concentrations rapidly declined within the first hour, followed by a second phase with a slower decline in concentration (Fig. 2C). Although there was no clear dose-linearity in ELF, the general decreasing trend in mean niclosamide concentrations observed across the doses relative to each time point indicates clearance from the lung over time.\n\n## Comparison of lung targeting between nebulization and oral administration\nComparing the mean AUC and apparent Cmax of niclosamide in ELF following nebulization and a human equivalent 2 g oral dose (1132 mg niclosamide corresponding to 27.88 mg/kg), an increase in lung exposure was demonstrated using the nebulized administration (Fig. 2D). Nebulization of 5% of the oral niclosamide dose resulted in a 71 times higher AUC and 578 times higher Cmax, in the ELF. Substantially lower pulmonary exposure by the oral route is driven by low plasma exposure and hence only low levels of drug are able to transfer from plasma to the pulmonary compartment: quantifiable ELF niclosamide concentrations in the oral arm were detected in only two sheep (a total of 4 samples) (Table II). This result suggests enhanced lung targeting after nebulized delivery relative to the oral route of administration.\n\n## Discussion\nWe here present data on the plasma and pulmonary pharmacokinetics of a nebulized NEN solution combined with lung function testing using a well-established sheep model. We showed that absorption and systemic disposition of nebulized NEN is linear and predictable within the dose ranges of 10-60 mg. Importantly, the plasma kinetics in the sheep model described accurately the absorption kinetics of nebulized niclosamide in human in t",
