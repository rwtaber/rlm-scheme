  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Envelope stress responses (ESRs) are critical for adaptive resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents. However, ESRs are poorly defined in a large number of well-known plant and human pathogens. Dickeya oryzae can withstand a high level of self-produced envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents zeamines through a zeamine-stimulated RND efflux pump DesABC. Here, we unraveled the mechanism of D. oryzae response to zeamines and determined the distribution and function of this novel ESR in a variety of important plant and human pathogens. RESULTS: In this study, we documented that a two-component system regulator DzrR of D. oryzae EC1 mediates ESR in the presence of envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents. DzrR was found modulating bacterial response and resistance to zeamines through inducing the expression of RND efflux pump DesABC, which is likely independent on DzrR phosphorylation. In addition, DzrR could also mediate bacterial responses to structurally divergent envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents, including chlorhexidine and chlorpromazine. Significantly, the DzrR-mediated response was independent on the five canonical ESRs. We further presented evidence that the DzrR-mediated response is conserved in the bacterial species of Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia, showing that a distantly located DzrR homolog is the previously undetermined regulator of RND-8 efflux pump for chlorhexidine resistance in B. cenocepacia. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the findings from this study depict a new widely distributed Gram-negative ESR mechanism and present a valid target and useful clues to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

  "full_text": "## Background\nBacterial cells frequently encounter divergent toxic agents in hazardous environments. Cell envelope provides the first line of defense for protecting bacterial cells from damages caused by envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents, oxidative reagents, and other extracellular stresses. Envelope stress response (ESR) mechanisms are crucial for maintenance of bacterial envelope homeostasis by activating protective mechanisms against envelope-damaging stresses [1]. Five widespread ESRs, i.e., Bae, Cpx, RpoE (\u03c3E), Rcs, and Psp, have been identified in Escherichia coli and other bacterial species upon exposure to envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents [1, 2], such as vancomycin [3], \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [4], chlorhexidine [5\u20138], chlorpromazine [6, 7], and polymyxin B [9, 10]. These reported ESR mechanisms are mainly through maintaining the compositions of cell envelope [2, 11], and activating the expression of RND efflux pumps [12\u201314].\nAmong these five widely conserved ESRs, Bae, Cpx, and Rcs use phosphorelay proteins to regulate the expression of target genes. Upon exposure to antimicrobial agents, both Bae and Cpx responses are commonly implicated in regulation of RND efflux pumps [15], while Rcs response is often associated with altering cell surface structure [16]. Bae response constitutes a two-component system (TCS) sensor kinase BaeS and a response regulator BaeR [12]. In E. coli, the phosphorylated BaeR is required for the direct regulation of RND efflux pump gene acrD, conferring bacterial resistance against SDS upon exposure to indole [17]. In Erwinia amylovora, the phosphorylation and inducible expression of BaeR increase the expression level of MdtABC for bacterial resistance against tannin [13]. Cpx response contains a TCS senor kinase CpxA and a response regulator CpxR together with a lipoprotein NlpE and a periplasmic repressor CpxP [18]. In E. coli, CpxR mediates the indole regulation on RND efflux pump genes acrAB, tolC, acrD, and mdtA, which is required for bacterial resistance against protamine, SDS, and rhodamine 6G [17, 19]. In Vibrio cholerae, CpxR was proposed to directly control the expression of RND efflux pump genes vexAB and vexGH with putative CpxR binding site in their promoter regions in the presence of KCl [14]. Rcs response is a complex regulatory system with phosphorelay proteins, in which RcsC and RcsD are senor kinases, and RcsB serves as a response regulator for modulating gene expression [16]. Unlike the TCS response regulators in ESRs, RcsB can adopt both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states in gene regulation. The unphosphorylated RcsB can interact with FixJ/NarL family transcriptional regulators, including BglJ, GadE, DctR, and MatA, to regulate bacterial physiology and metabolism, including bacterial motility and cell membrane compositions [20].\nZeamines and structurally related chemical compounds, i.e., fabclavines, are polyamine antimicrobial agents produced by Dickeya, Serratia, and Xenorhabdus strains [21\u201325]. In Dickeya and S. plymuthica, zeamines are synthesized by zms (zmn) cluster genes, in which zmsA (zmn10) is one of the key genes required for the biosynthesis of all zeamine molecules [22, 25]. Previous studies unveiled the potent inhibitory activities of zeamines against the growth of nematodes, fungi, oomycetes, and multidrug-resistant bacteria [21, 26, 27] and demonstrated that zeamines act by damaging the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria in a way similar to cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B [28], implicating that zeamines may trigger ESRs in a way similar to polymyxin B [10, 29]. However, our recent study showed that responses to zeamines and polymyxin B in D. oryzae EC1, formerly known as D. zeae EC1 [30], are different [31]. Exposure to a low level of zeamines (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) could significantly increase the expression level of efflux pump genes desAB, which encode a RND efflux pump DesABC, whereas polymyxin B was unable to trigger desAB expression even at a much higher concentration (100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) [31]. This suggests that D. oryzae EC1 may evolve a new ESR mechanism in response to zeamines.\nIn this study, we found that the dzrR gene, which is located next to the desAB genes in D. oryzae EC1, encodes a key regulator modulating bacterial resistance to zeamines. DzrR induced the transcriptional expression of desAB upon exposure to zeamines likely in a protein phosphorylation-independent manner. In addition, we showed that a range of envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents, including chlorhexidine and chlorpromazine, could also activate desAB expression through DzrR, and this activation was not dependent on the previously characterized canonical ESRs. Furthermore, we found that the DzrR-dependent ESR is widely conserved in Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia species. Interestingly, we showed that in B. cenocepacia, although the genomic location of dzrR homolog is far from the desAB homologs, its protein product could still directly activate the efflux pump gene expression in the presence of chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine is a widely used antimicrobial agent for skin disinfection before surgery and for sterilization of surgical instruments. Identification of this novel and widespread DzrR-mediated ESR mechanism would be of significant implications in our fight against the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n## Identification of DzrR associated with zeamine resistance in \nIn D. oryzae EC1, expression of the efflux pump genes desAB was found induced by the self-produced antimicrobial agents zeamines, which suggests a regulatory mechanism for sensing and responding to these toxic agents. To identify this putative regulatory mechanism, a reporter strain \u2206zmsK(pPdesAB-Gfp) was generated by introducing a previously constructed reporter plasmid pPdesAB-Gfp (pDesABgfp) [31], in which the gfp was placed under the control of the desAB promoter, into the \u2206zmsK mutant producing only zeamine II [23] and with a significantly higher expression level of desAB than the wild-type strain EC1 (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). The reporter \u2206zmsK(pPdesAB-Gfp) was selected as the parental strain for random transposon mutagenesis with mariner-based transposon carried by pBT20 [32]. The relative fluorescence of transposon mutants cultured in the LS5 medium, which was optimized for zeamine production [31], was determined to screen for the genes affecting the expression level of desAB. After screening about 9400 mutants, a transposon insertion mutant Dz974, which produced about 16-fold less amount of relative fluorescence than its parental strain \u2206zmsK(pPdesAB-Gfp), was obtained (Fig.\u00a01A). Unlike the negative control strain \u2206zmsA(pPdesAB-Gfp), which did not produce zeamines [22], the relative fluorescence of Dz974 did not increase after exogenous supplement of zeamines (20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) (Fig.\u00a01A), suggesting that bacterial response to zeamines was abolished in Dz974. To identify the mutated gene in Dz974, the flanking regions of the transposon insertion were determined by FPNI-PCR [33]. The results showed that Dz974 contains a transposon insertion at the 125th base pair of a 738-bp coding sequence of a gene (NCBI accession no. W909_RS06570) next to desAB (Fig.\u00a01B). This gene encodes a putative TCS response regulator with REC and Trans_reg_C domains (Fig.\u00a01C) and was herewith designated as dzrR (Dickeya zeamine resistance regulator).Fig. 1Identification of dzrR in Dickeya oryzae EC1. A Relative fluorescence of \u2206zmsK(pPdesAB-Gfp), \u2206zmsA(pPdesAB-Gfp), and Dz974 upon exposure to zeamines (\u2009+) or not (\u2009\u2212). Bacterial strains were cultured in 96-well plates containing LS5 medium with exogenous addition of zeamines (\u2009+) or not (\u2009\u2212), at 28\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. After incubation, cell culture dilutions were transferred into 96-well black clear-bottom plates for measuring optical density at 600\u00a0nm (OD600) and fluorescence density (excitation at 485\u00a0nm and emission at 535\u00a0nm). The fluorescence of bacterial strain was calculated by dividing its fluorescence density reading with its optical density reading. The relative fluorescence of bacterial strain was expressed as the fluorescence of bacterial strain normalized to the fluorescence of \u2206zmsK(pPdesAB-Gfp) with the same treatment. The relative fluorescence is presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093.

D The transcript level of desB in wild-type strain EC1, dzrR mutant, and complementation strain \u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR) monitored by RT-qPCR assay. Fold change of desB expression was analyzed using 2\u2212\u2206\u2206CT method, with 16S rRNA gene serving as the endogenous control and the wild-type strain EC1 as the reference sample. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20094. Statistical analysis was performed using permutation test versus the wild-type strain EC1. *P\u2009<\u20090.05\nTo validate the role of DzrR in regulation of the desAB expression and zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1, we generated an in-frame deletion mutant \u2206dzrR and a complementation strain \u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR). Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed that deletion of dzrR caused significantly decreased transcript level of desB when \u2206dzrR was cultured in LS5 medium (fold change\u2009>\u20092, P\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a01C) and in trans expression of dzrR in \u2206dzrR could restore desB expression (Fig.\u00a01D). In addition, we found that DzrR was not involved in regulation of zeamine production (Additional file 1: Fig. S2A) and expression of dzrR could not be stimulated by zeamines (Additional file 1: Fig. S2B and S2C). To elucidate whether DzrR contributes to zeamine resistance in D. oryzae EC1, we constructed dzrR deletion mutant using the wild-type EC1 as a parent strain. In addition, to avoid potential interference of the self-produced zeamines in minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, a dzrR deletion mutant was also generated at the background of the zeamine-minus mutant \u2206zmsA. MICs of zeamines for the parent strains, i.e., \u2206zmsA and the wild-type strain EC1, dzrR mutants \u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR and \u2206dzrR, and the complementation strains \u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR) and \u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR) were determined by broth microdilution method in 96-well plates. The results indicated that similar to desAB [31], null mutation of dzrR compromised bacterial resistance against zeamines. Deletion of dzrR resulted in about 2\u2013fourfold decrease in the MICs of zeamines compared to the parental strains, which was restored by in trans expression of dzrR (Table 1). These findings suggest that DzrR plays a key role in regulation of the D. oryzae resistance against zeamines by activating the transcriptional expression of the RND efflux pump genes desAB upon exposure to zeamines.Table 1Zeamine susceptibility of D. oryzae strainsStrainsMIC (\u03bcg/ml)Zeamines\u2206zmsA1800\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR450\u2013900\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB)450\u2013900\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR)1800\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRE22A)1800\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRD23A)1800\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRD66A)1800\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRTrans_reg_C)900\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR3937)1800\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRGMI1000)1800\u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR25416)1800EC11800\u2206dzrR900\u2206dzrR(pBB)900\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR)1800\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRE22A)1800\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRD23A)1800\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRD66A)1800\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRTrans_reg_C)900\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR3937)1800\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrRGMI1000)1800\u2206dzrR(pBB-dzrR25416)1800MIC of zeamines for each D. oryzae strain was determined using broth microdilution method according to the recommendations from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Fresh bacterial cultures were inoculated in the wells of 96-well plates containing LB medium with twofold dilutions of zeamines. The lowest concentration of zeamines that prevents the visible growth of each D. oryzae strain is considered as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)\n\n## DzrR specifically binds to the promoter region of \nTo elucidate how DzrR could modulate the expression of desAB, the potential interaction between DzrR and the established 222-bp promoter region of desAB (PdesAB) [31] was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The results showed that a final concentration of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM or 1\u00a0\u03bcM of tag-free DzrR could cause mobility shift of biotin-labeled PdesAB (Bound probe, Fig.\u00a02A), suggesting a direct interaction between DzrR and PdesAB. The specific binding of DzrR to PdesAB was validated as addition of excessive unlabeled PdesAB could inhibit the DNA mobility shift, and the same amount of DzrR could not cause mobility shift of the biotin-labeled control DNA fragment provided by the EMSA kit (Fig.\u00a02A). Together with the regulatory role of DzrR on desAB expression in the presence of zeamines (Fig.\u00a01A and D), the above findings demonstrated that DzrR controls the transcriptional expression of desAB likely via directly binding to PdesAB.Fig. 2DzrR specifically binds to the promoter of desAB. A EMSA of DzrR binding to the promoter fragment of desAB. Free probes, i.e., biotin-labeled DNA fragment of PdesAB (222\u00a0bp) and biotin-labeled control DNA (60\u00a0bp), and PdesAB probe with DzrR (Bound probe) are indicated by arrows. B DNase I footprinting assay performed between DzrR and the promoter fragment of desAB labeled with FAM and HEX. C DzrR binding site in desAB promoter region. DzrR binding site, potential -35 and -10 regions, and start codon (ATG) of desA gene are indicated and underlined. D EMSA of DzrR binding to a 37-bp DNA fragment (PdesAB(37)) containing the DzrR protected region identified in DNase I footprinting assay (C). Free probe of PdesAB(37) (37\u00a0bp) and PdesAB(37) probe with DzrR (Bound probe) are indicated by arrows. In A and D, biotin-labeled DNA probes and biotin-labeled control DNA from EMSA kit were added at a final concentration of 20 fmol. In A, a concentration of 4\u00a0pmol unlabeled DNA fragment of PdesAB was added as a competitor for determining the specific binding of DzrR. In B, BSA (bovine serum albumin) was used as the negative control in DNase I footprinting assay for analyzing the specific region protected by DzrR\nTo identify the DzrR binding site in PdesAB, DNase I footprinting assay was performed on PdesAB labeled with FAM (5\u2032) and HEX (3\u2032). The results unveiled that DzrR might specifically bind to a 25-bp region (5\u2032-CGGTTCTCCATCATATCTCCATATT-3\u2032) in PdesAB (Fig.\u00a02B and C). For validation, a 37-bp DNA fragment PdesAB(37), containing the above identified putative DzrR binding site in the middle, was generated and labeled with biotin by annealing the primer pairs Biotin-PdesAB(37)-F/PdesAB(37)-R together (nucleotide acid sequences refer to Additional file 2: Table S2) for EMSA analysis. The results showed that addition of DzrR could cause DNA band mobility shift of Biotin-PdesAB(37) (Bound probe, Fig.\u00a02D), validating the DzrR binding site identified in DNase I footprinting assay (Fig.\u00a02B\u2013C).\n\n## Regulatory capacity of DzrR is likely independent on protein phosphorylation\nDzrR is a proposed TCS response regulator with REC and Trans_reg_C domains (Fig.\u00a01C). Bioinformatics analysis showed that its best-characterized homolog is AdeR in Acinetobacter baumannii (NCBI accession no. WP_000459547.1), which has a relatively high level of amino acid sequence identity (52%) and similarity (68%) compared to DzrR, and adopts a phosphorylated manner to regulate the expression of the genes encoding a RND efflux pump AdeABC [34, 35]. Sequence alignment performed among the REC domains of DzrR, AdeR, and three well-studied canonical TCS response regulators in E. coli, i.e., PhoB, OmpR, and CheY, illustrated the potential conserved five \u03b1\u03b2 folds and amino acid residues required for protein phosphorylation (E22, D23, and D66) and signal transduction (T93 and K115) [36] (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A). To test whether the DzrR function is dependent on phosphorylation, DzrR variants with E22, D23, and D66 being replaced by alanine respectively were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. MIC assay showed that in trans expression of the E22, D23, and D66 variants in \u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR and \u2206dzrR mutants respectively could restore zeamine resistance (Table 1). The results suggest that these conserved amino acid residues associated with protein phosphorylation were not responsible for the DzrR function in zeamine resistance. RT-qPCR assay further confirmed that substitution of D66, which is the key amino acid residue required for phosphoryl group acceptance [36], did not affect the DzrR-dependent expression of desB in the presence of zeamines (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B).\nTo further assess the potential involvement of phosphorylation in modulation of DzrR activity, we conducted the alanine scanning mutagenesis by substituting each of the 111 amino acid in the REC domain of DzrR (with the exception of 10 alanines, E22, D23, and D66). These variants as well as their wild-type dzrR were cloned in the vector pBBR1-MCS4 and introduced into the \u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR and \u2206dzrR mutants, respectively, and assayed for their ability to restore the mutant growth in the presence of lethal concentration of zeamines. The results showed that all the DzrR variants, including those of the conserved residues T93 and K115 involved in signal transduction [36] (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A), could rescue the mutant growth in the LB medium supplemented with zeamines at a final concentration of 900\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (Additional file 1: Fig. S4 and S5). These findings suggest that DzrR might adopt an unphosphorylated form to mediate zeamine response and resistance in D. oryzae EC1.\n\n## Zeamines induce \nA previous study indicated that zeamines target bacterial cell envelope [28], which together with our results suggest that DzrR might be a key regulator associated with ESR in D. oryzae. To test this possibility, the relative fluorescence of \u2206zmsA(pPdesAB-Gfp) was determined upon exposure to a few known envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents and signaling compounds by Gfp\u00a0transcriptional fusion assay following the established protocol [31]. The results indicated that antimicrobial agents that target cell envelope, i.e., chlorhexidine, chlorpromazine, and xinjunan [5, 37], significantly induced desAB expression at a sub-inhibitory concentration whereas the signaling compounds, i.e., spermidine [38], putrescine [39], and indole [17, 40], did not have a comparable regulatory effect at the same concentration (Fig.\u00a03A, structures of chemical compounds refer to Additional file 1: Fig. S6). In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, chlorhexidine stimulates the expression of RND efflux pump MexCD-OprJ through RpoE ESR [5]. However, in D. oryzae, deletion of rpoE (NCBI accession no. W909_RS14550) did not affect the stimulated expression of desAB upon exposure to chlorhexidine or other three envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents, i.e., chlorpromazine, xinjunan, and zeamines (Fig.\u00a03B). Similarly, inactivation of the other four canonical ESR regulatory genes, i.e., baeR (NCBI accession no. W909_RS13980), cpxR (NCBI accession no. W909_RS18830), rcsB (NCBI accession no. W909_RS05280), or pspF (NCBI accession no. W909_RS11125) did not compromise the stimulated expression of desAB in the presence of zeamines (Fig.\u00a03B). These findings suggest DzrR represents a new ESR mechanism against zeamines in D. oryzae.Fig. 3Expression of desAB is induced by envelope-targeting antimicrobial agents. A Relative fluorescence of \u2206zmsA(pPdesAB-Gfp) in the presence of different chemical compounds. The relative fluorescence was expressed as the fluorescence of \u2206zmsA(pPdesAB-Gfp) cells treated with different compounds normalized to the fluorescence of \u2206zmsA(pPdesAB-Gfp) cells treated with the same amount of solvent (DMSO or methanol).

The relative fluorescence was expressed as the fluorescence of bacterial cells treated with antimicrobial agents normalized to the fluorescence of bacterial cells treated with the same amount of solvent (DMSO or methanol). The relative fluorescence is presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t test versus the solvent control. **P\u2009<\u20090.01. In A and B, bacterial cell cultures at an optical density at 600\u00a0nm (OD600) about 0.5 were treated with different chemical compounds at 28\u00a0\u00b0C for 8\u00a0h. After incubation, the average fluorescence intensity of 50,000 bacterial cells was measured by a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) for determining the relative fluorescence of bacterial strains under different treatments. The final concentration of the chemical compounds were 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (A) or 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (B), respectively, except for chlorhexidine, which was added at 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml as a higher concentration of chlorhexidine arrested the growth of D. oryzae EC1\n\n## DzrR homologs found in \nDesB encodes a RND efflux pump inner membrane protein, which is crucial for determining the substrate profile and specificity of the RND efflux pump DesABC [31]. Our previous study indicated that homologs of desB are conserved in various bacterial species [31]. It is interesting to explore whether DzrR is also widely conserved. We therefore conducted a BLASTp search using the amino acid sequence of DzrR as the bait. The results indicated that DzrR homologs sharing a high level of sequence identity (above 50%) and similarity (above 67%) were detected not only in Dickeya, but also in a range of bacterial species, including Ralstonia and Burkholderia (Additional file 2: Table S3). Sequence alignment of DzrR and its homologs from D. dadantii 3937 [41], R. solanacearum GMI1000 [42], B. glumae BGR1 [43], B. cepacia ATCC 25416 [44], and B. cenocepacia J2315 and H111 [7, 45\u201347] revealed that the REC and Trans_reg_C domains of DzrR homologs had a high level of sequence identity (above 72%) and similarity (above 85%) with their counterparts in DzrR, respectively (Fig. 4A and C). The high level of similarity suggests that DzrR homologs found in Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia species may have a similar ESR activity as DzrR. To verify this possibility, zeamine resistance assay was performed on the \u2206zmsA\u2206dzrR and \u2206dzrR mutants expressing the dzrR homologs from D. dadantii 3937 (dzrR3937), R. solanacearum GMI1000 (dzrRGMI1000), and B. cepacia ATCC 25416 (dzrR25416), respectively. The results showed that heterologous expression of the dzrR homologs could fully restore the zeamine resistance (Table 1).Fig. 4DzrR homologs from Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia strains are highly conserved.

Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20094. Statistical analysis was performed using permutation test versus \u2206dzrR(pBB). *P\u2009<\u20090.05. E EMSA of DzrR25416 binding to the 37-bp DNA fragment (PdesAB(37)) from D. oryzae EC1. Free probe of PdesAB(37) (37\u00a0bp) and PdesAB(37) probe with DzrR homolog from B. cepacia ATCC 25416 (DzrR25416) (Bound probe) are indicated by arrows\nFor further validation, we conducted RT-qPCR analysis, DNase I footprinting assay, and EMSA. The RT-qPCR results showed that heterologous expression of the dzrR homologs resulted in a more than twofold of increase in transcript level of desB compared to the vector control (Fig.\u00a04D). Furthermore, DNase I footprinting assay and EMSA confirmed that the DzrR homolog found in B. cepacia ATCC 25416, i.e., DzrR25416, could specifically bind to the same region in PdesAB as DzrR did (Figs.\u00a02B, 4B, and E). These findings suggest that DzrR homologs found in Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia species have a similar activity in modulating desAB expression against zeamines.\n\n## DzrR-regulating expression of the desABC homologs is conserved in B. cenocepacia\nConsidering the wide distribution of dzrR and desB homologs in Gram-negative bacteria, it is intriguing whether they are genetically located adjacent to each other as dzrR and desB in D. oryzae EC1. Genome sequence analysis revealed that desB and dzrR homologs are located next to each other in Dickeya and Ralstonia strains (Fig.\u00a05A; Additional file 2: Table S4) but varied in genetic arrangement in Burkholderia species, showing three types of genetic arrangement: (I) dzrR and desB homologs are located adjacent to each other but transcribed divergently (B. glumae, B. stagnalis, and B. ubonensis); (II) dzrR and desB homologs are neighboring with the same transcriptional orientation (B. pseudomultivorans and B. multivoran); (III) dzrR and desB homologs are distantly located in the same chromosome (B. pyrrocinia, B. cenocepacia, and B. seminalis) or different chromosomes (B. stabilis, B. cepacia, B. metallica, B. lata, and B. contaminans) (Additional file 2: Table S4). In addition, the genetic organization of the desABC homologs in Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia strains are different. Unlike Dickeya strains, in which desC encoding the outer membrane protein of the DesABC efflux pump is not at the same location as desAB in the bacterial genome, the desAB homologs in Ralstonia and Burkholderia strains are located together with desC homologs as a single operon (Fig.\u00a05A; Additional file 2: Table S4). Interestingly, although the genetic organization and arrangement of dzrR and desABC homologs are varied in Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia strains, a conserved box (5\u2032-N5-CTCCATC-N2-A-N-CTCCAT-N2-T-3\u2032), which harbors two direct 5\u2032-CTCCAT-3\u2032 sequence repeats, was found in the promoter region of all the desAB homologs in Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia strains (Fig.\u00a05B). These findings suggest that in Burkholderia strains, the DzrR homologs may directly regulate the expression of distantly located desAB homologs. To validate this hypothesis, EMSA and DNase I footprinting assay were performed between DzrR25416 and the promoter fragment of desAB homologs found in B. cepacia ATCC 25,416 (PdesB25416). The results showed that DzrR25416 directly interacted with the proposed dzrR box in PdesB25416 (Fig.\u00a05C and D). In B. cenocepacia J2315, the desAB homologs, i.e., BCAM0927 and BCAM0926, which encode the RND-8 efflux pump [7], share about 77% and 86% similarity with their counterparts in D. oryzae EC1, respectively (Fig.\u00a05A). Previous studies demonstrated that their expression is stimulated by exposure to chlorhexidine and chlorpromazine [6, 7]. However, the direct regulator of the RND-8 efflux pump has not yet been characterized [6, 7]. Given the presence of the conserved dzrR box in the promoter of the RND-8 efflux operon in B. cenocepacia strains (Fig.\u00a05B), and the fact that chlorhexidine and chlorpromazine also induced the expression of desAB in D. oryzae EC1 (Fig.\u00a03A), we speculated that the DzrR homolog, although its coding gene is located at a distant location, might play a role in modulation of the RND-8 efflux operon expression upon exposure to chlorhexidine and chlorpromazine. The potential regulatory linkage between DzrR homolog and RND-8 efflux operon was thus investigated in a well-studied strain B. cenocepacia H111 [46]. Expression of RND-8H111 efflux operon in the wild-type strain H111 and the dzrRH111 mutant, i.e., \u2206dzrRH111, were compared by determining the relative fluorescence of gfp reporter strains H111(pPRND-8-Gfp) and \u2206dzrRH111(pPRND-8-Gfp) upon exposure to chlorhexidine and chlorpromazine, respectively. The results showed that inactivation of dzrRH111 basically abolished the chlorhexidine or chlorpromazine stimulated expression of RND-8H111 efflux operon (Fig.\u00a05E). In addition, null mutation of dzrRH111 increased the chlorhexidine susceptibility in B. cenocepacia H111, which was fully restored by in trans expression of the dzrRH111 in the mutant (Fig.\u00a05F). These findings thus demonstrated unequivocally that DzrRH111 modulates chlorhexidine resistance through regulating the expression of RND-8H111 efflux operon in B. cenocepacia H111.Fig. 5The regulatory linkage between DzrR and desABC in Dickeya, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia strains.
