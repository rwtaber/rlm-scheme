  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The application of biomimetic and stimuli-responsive nanocarriers displays considerable promise in improving the management of bacterial sepsis and overcoming antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the study aimed to synthesize a novel hyaluronic acid-lysine conjugate (HA-Lys) and to utilize the attributes of the synthesized HA-Lys with Tocopherol succinate (TS) and Oleylamine (OLA) in the formulation of multifunctional biomimetic pH-responsive HNLCs loaded with vancomycin (VCM-HNLCs), to combat bacterial sepsis. METHODS: A novel hyaluronic acid-lysine conjugate (HA-Lys) was synthesized and characterized using FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Vancomycin-loaded hybrid nanosystems (VCM-HNLCs) were prepared through hot homogenization ultrasonication and evaluated for particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), and encapsulation efficiency (EE%). In vitro biocompatibility was assessed via MTT assay and red blood cell hemolysis test. The binding affinity to TLR2 and TLR4 was measured using microscale thermophoresis (MST). Drug release was evaluated using the dialysis bag method. Antimicrobial activity against MRSA and efflux pump inhibition were also determined. Efficacy was demonstrated in an MRSA-induced sepsis mice model. RESULTS: The VCM-HNLCs, produced via hot homogenization ultrasonication, exhibited particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), and encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of 110.77\u2009\u00b1\u20091.692 nm, 0.113\u2009\u00b1\u20090.022, -\u20092.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.210 mV, and 76.27\u2009\u00b1\u20091.200%, respectively. In vitro, biocompatibility was proven by hemolysis and cytotoxicity studies. The VCM-HNLCs demonstrated targetability to human Toll-like receptors (TLR 2 and 4) as validated by microscale thermophoresis (MST). VCM-HNLCs showed a twofold reduction in MIC values at physiological pH compared to the bare VCM against S. aureus and MRSA for 48\u00a0h. While at pH 6.0, MIC values were reduced by fourfold in the first 24\u00a0h and by eightfold in the subsequent 48 and 72\u00a0h against tested strains. Furthermore, VCM-HNLCs showed inhibitory effects against MRSA efflux pumps, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hyperinflammation. In an MRSA-induced sepsis mice model, VCM-HNLCs demonstrated superior efficacy compared to free VCM, significantly eliminated bacteria and improved survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results highlight the potential of VCM-HNLCs as novel multifunctional nanocarriers to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and enhance sepsis outcomes.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nBacterial sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction, arises from a dysregulated host immune response to infection [1]. It poses a significant public health concern globally, with high morbidity and mortality rates despite advances in medical care. According to the Global Burden of Disease Report by the World Health Organization (WHO), sepsis affects more than 49 million people annually, resulting in approximately 11 million deaths, accounting for 20% of all global deaths [2]. Additionally, about 30% of septic patients who survive the initial inflammatory storm may encounter long-term immunosuppressive dysfunctions and cognitive impairment, further burdening individuals and society [3, 4]. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) further complicates infection therapy and sepsis management in all settings, especially in high-risk populations, such as infants and patients in intensive care units (ICUs) [2, 5, 6].\nThe pathophysiology of sepsis involves a complex cascade of events, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, activation of coagulation pathways, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), endothelial and organ dysfunction, and impaired immune response [7]. In addition, the dysregulated immune response in sepsis can lead to immunosuppression, increasing patients' vulnerability to secondary infections and worsening the clinical course of sepsis [8, 9]. Thus, innovative multi-task therapeutic approaches and enhanced antibiotic treatments are urgently needed to mitigate AMR and control the dysregulated immune response during sepsis.\nDuring infections, pattern recognition receptors in the host cell, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), are activated by microbial toxins such as peptidoglycan (PGN) of gram-positive bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of gram-negative bacteria, enabling the innate immune system to identify invasive pathogens such as bacteria [10]. However, in severe bacterial sepsis, excessive activation of TLRs occurs, leading to systemic inflammation and organ damage [11, 12]. Researchers have identified small drug molecules and antibodies that prevent TLR ligands from binding to the receptor, and they have shown promising results in controlling TLR-induced hyperinflammation in many inflammatory diseases like sepsis [13\u201318]. Therefore, this biomimetic strategy of minimizing TLR activation by inhibiting their binding to bacterial toxins can be applied to designing a targeted nanobiotic with enhanced bacterial killing potential and modulation of inflammation during sepsis.\nNanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have emerged as a promising approach in drug delivery, particularly for treating bacterial infections and related inflammatory disorders [19, 20]. These nanoparticles (NPs) offer numerous advantages, including nanosized-dependent properties, tissue-targeted drug delivery, ease of fabrication, and cost-efficiency, making these delivery systems more attractive [21\u201324]. Recently, hybrid NLCs-based nanosystems (HNLCs) have been developed by incorporating different polymeric biomaterials into the NLCs make-up to increase their stability, improve their pharmacokinetic properties and enhance the encapsulation of hydrophilic drugs in a lipid-based nanoformulation [25, 26]. Limited studies have reported the use of HNLCs for the delivery of antihypertensive [25], anticancer [27, 28] and antimalarial drugs to date [29]. Only one study reported the application of chitosan-based HNLCs for antibiotic delivery [30]. Therefore, there is a need to explore innovative combinations of materials with multifunctional properties to develop biomimetic pH-responsive HNLCs with enhanced efficacy and targeted antibiotic delivery against bacterial sepsis.\nHigh molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HA) has gained attention as a potential therapeutic agent in managing inflammation due to its well-known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties [31]. Several studies have reported the ability of HA to reduce the overactivation of TLRs by selectively binding to the receptor and inhibiting their binding to bacterial endotoxins [32\u201335]. In contrast, L-Lysine (Lys), an essential amino acid, has shown potential in managing oxidative stress related to many disease conditions, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung infections and sepsis [36\u201338]. This effect plays a beneficial role in scavenging and neutralizing ROS generated during the inflammatory process, thereby reducing tissue damage during sepsis [39]. Combining HA with Lys into a novel HA-Lys conjugate could, therefore, offer a novel therapeutic adjuvant with increased potency against sepsis.\nTocopherol succinate (TS), a vitamin E derivative, has also shown potential in treating various infectious diseases, primarily due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties [40, 41]. It has shown promising efflux pump inhibition activities, mainly against NorA and NorB of gram-positive bacteria, allowing for more enhanced intracellular accumulation of antibiotics, making it suitable for combating multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria [42\u201344]. Moreover, it has been reported that TS has significant anti-adhesive properties against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilms [45, 46]. On the other hand, Oleylamine (OLA), a pH-responsive lipid, offers unique properties that can be exploited in the design of drug delivery systems. Since bacterial infections can lower the physiological pH to acidic levels at the infectious sites, combining the pH-dependent functionality of OLA with its intrinsic antimicrobial behavior could enable the development of lipid-based nanosystems with controlled drug release and improved therapy against infectious diseases [47]. Overall, designing a multifunctional HNLC that combines the benefits of HA-Lys conjugate, TS and OLA could improve the therapeutic index of antibiotics and enhance the performance of the drug delivery system against bacterial sepsis.\nTherefore, the study aimed to synthesize a novel HA-Lys conjugate and to utilize the attributes of the synthesized HA-Lys with TS and OLA in the formulation of multifunctional biomimetic pH-responsive HNLCs loaded with vancomycin (VCM-HNLCs), to combat bacterial sepsis. We hypothesize that HA-Lys may directly and competitively bind to host TLR2 or TLR4, preventing their binding to bacterial toxins, reducing excessive TLR activation and neutralizing ROS. Also, TS may potentially reduce bacterial antibiotic resistance via its potential activity against biofilm formation and efflux pumps. In addition, the on-demand release of VCM from the HNLCs could be enhanced through the pH sensitivity of OLA. To our knowledge, this is the first report on synthesizing and utilization of a modified HA-Lys polymer as a targeting adjuvant to treat bacterial sepsis. Also, this study reports the first stimuli-responsive HNLCs for the delivery of any class of drug and the first combined biomimetic and pH-responsive HNLCs to deliver antibiotics against bacterial sepsis. The data obtained from the synthesis and characterization of HA-Lys conjugate, formulation and optimization of VCM-HNLCs, in vitro characterization and in vitro antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory studies are provided herein.\n\n## Materials\nL-Lysine (Lys), tocopherol succinate (TS), Oleylamine (OLA), 1-ethyl-3-(dimethyl amino propyl) carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS), ethidium bromide, peptidoglycan (PGN) from Staphylococcus aureus, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Escherichia coli (O55:B5) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).

Microscale thermophoresis (MST) reagents were purchased from Nano Temper Technologies (Germany). A mill-Q water purification system (Millipore Corp., USA) was used to obtain purified milli-Q water. All solvents and reagents used in this study were of analytical grade.\n\n## Synthesis and characterization of HA-Lys conjugate\nThe HA-Lys conjugate was synthesized by forming an amide bond between the primary amino group of Lys and the free carboxylic acid group of HA according to a previously documented EDC/NHS method with minor modifications (Scheme 1) [49, 50]. To activate the carboxyl acid groups of HA, 200\u00a0mg (0.496\u00a0mmol) of HA was dissolved in 50\u00a0mL of deionized water. Next, EDC (479.75\u00a0mg, 2.5\u00a0mmol) and NHS (287.7\u00a0mg, 2.5\u00a0mmol) were added to the HA solution, and the mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature for 15\u00a0min. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was mixed with 250 mg of Lys (1.710 mmol), and it was continuously stirred at room temperature overnight. The resultant conjugate solution was purified by three rounds of dialysis against 0.1% w/v NaCl solution and finally against distilled water, followed by lyophilization at \u2212\u200940 \u00b0C to obtain a white powder with a quantitative yield of 81.12%. The freeze-dried samples were characterized using FT-IR at 4 cm\u22121 resolution and 24 scans averaged (Bruker ALPHA II compact FT-IR spectrometer, UK) and 1H NMR (Bruker Advance 400\u00a0MHz spectrometer, UK), and then stored at 4 \u00b0C for further use. The characterization was as follows: 1H NMR: (400 MHz, D2O) \u03b4(ppm): HA: \u03b4 1.90 (c), 3.30\u20133.59 (f, g), and 4.44 (h); Lys: \u03b4 1.18 (a), 1.59\u20132.30 (b, d), and 2.76 (e) (Figure S1), and FT-IR: 3400, 3345.08, 3301.47, 2921.06, 2887.12, 1628.97, 1576.07, 1507, 1400.24, 1388.44, 1035.89 and 656.64 cm\u22121 (Figure S2).Scheme 1.Synthesis of HA-Lys conjugate using a one-step amidation reaction. (EDC: 1-ethyl-3- (dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide, NHS: N-hydroxy succinimide)\n\n## Preparation of the hybrid nanoparticles\nThe VCM-loaded HNLCs (VCM-HNLCs) were formulated using a previously reported hot homogenization/ultrasonication technique with a slight modification [20]. The following method is widely used for other similar compounds [51, 52] and was used to encapsulate vancomycin. TS, OLA, and VCM free base for the lipid phase\u00a0were dissolved in 2\u00a0mL of ethanol and heated at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. The aqueous phase was created by dissolving HA-Lys conjugate and a suitable surfactant in 20\u00a0mL of milli-Q water, heated separately at 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min. Both phases were mixed and homogenized using an Ultra Turrax T-25 homogenizer (IKA Labortechnik, Germany) at 6000\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min at the same temperature. The resulting emulsion was promptly cooled in an ice bath for 30\u00a0min after further sonication at 30% amplitude for 10\u00a0min using a probe sonicator (Omni Sonic-Ruptor 400 Ultrasonic Homogenizer, USA). Prepared VCM-HNLCs were stirred overnight to remove the organic solvent, with milli-Q water used to adjust the final volume to 20\u00a0mL if necessary. Blank (VCM-free) HNLCs were also prepared using the same procedure. The prepared nanoformulations were stored in 4\u00a0\u00b0C for further characterization. Various surfactants (Span 80, PEG 400, PVP, PLX 188, and Tween 80) were screened to ensure nanosystem stability. Subsequently, various parameters, including lipid: surfactant, drug: lipid and lipid: polymer mass ratios, were evaluated. The optimal formulation, characterized by minimum particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), maximum entrapment efficiency percent (EE%), and drug loading capacity (DL% w/w), was selected for further studies. Each batch was prepared in triplicate.\n\n## Determination of particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP) and surface morphology\nThe mean particle size, PDI and ZP of the fabricated VCM-HNLCs were measured using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method with a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK) fitted with a 633\u00a0nm laser at 173\u00b0 detection optics. The samples were appropriately diluted in distilled water, and the measurement was carried out in triplicate at 25\u00a0\u00b0C.\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze the morphological structure of VCM-HNLCs. On a coated grid surface, a drop of properly diluted VCM-HNLCs formulation was placed. It was then let to dry at room temperature, stained for 30\u00a0s with 2% phosphotungstic acid and then visualized at an accelerating voltage of 75\u00a0kV to obtain TEM images.\n\n## Determination of entrapment efficiency percent (EE %) and drug loading capacity (DL % w/w)\nA previously described ultrafiltration method was employed to determine the entrapment efficiency (EE %) and the drug loading capacity (DL % w/w) of VCM within the HNLCs [20]. Concisely, 2\u00a0mL of the formulation was added to an AmiconUltra-4 centrifugal filter tube (Millipore Corp., USA) with a molecular weight cutoff of 10\u00a0kDa and centrifuged at 3000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min at room temperature. The concentration of free VCM in the supernatant was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an LC-2050C- 3D (Shimadzu HPLC, Japan) with UV detection at 280\u00a0nm, 0.1% aqueous trifluoracetic acid: acetonitrile (15:85) as mobile phases, Gemini\u00ae 5\u00a0\u00b5m NX-C18 110\u00a0\u00c5 (250\u2009\u00d7\u20094.6\u00a0mm) column, 1\u00a0mL/min low-pressure gradient flow rate, 100 \u03bcL injection volume, and 10\u00a0min run time, with a linear equation of Y\u2009=\u200918,420 (x) \u2013 4555.5 and linearity coefficient (R2) of 0.9998 (Figure S3). The experiment was carried out in triplicate, and the EE % and DL % w/w were calculated using the following equations [53].1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{EE} \\%=\\frac{\\text{Weight of VCM in the HNLCs}}{\\text{Total weight of VCM added}}\\times 100$$\\end{document}EE%=Weight of VCM in the HNLCsTotal weight of VCM added\u00d71002\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{DL} \\%=\\frac{\\text{Weight of VCM in the HNLCs}}{\\text{Total weight of NPs}}\\times 100$$\\end{document}DL%=Weight of VCM in the HNLCsTotal weight of NPs\u00d7100\n\n## Thermal profiles\nUsing a Shimadzu DSC-60 (Japan), thermal analysis was performed to determine the thermograms of HA, Lys, HA-Lys conjugate, TS, VCM, physical mixture and lyophilized VCM-HNLCs. Briefly, 5\u00a0mg of each sample was loaded in an aluminum pan, which was then sealed with a crimper and heated under a stream of nitrogen to 330\u00a0\u00b0C at a steady 1 0\u00a0\u00b0C/min. An empty pan served as a reference.\n\n## Cytotoxicity and cell viability assay\nThe cytocompatibility of the synthesized HA-Lys conjugate and its nanoformulation (VCM-HNLCs) was assessed using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) and human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells, employing a previously reported MTT assay [54, 55]. Briefly, cells were seeded (2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/well) in a 96-well plate using 100 \u03bcL of DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% pen-strep-fungizone and 1% L-glutamine and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h using a CO2 humidified incubator. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for the next 24\u00a0h after being exposed to HA-Lys and VCM-HNLCs (diluted with DMEM) at doses of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. After that, the cells were grown for an extra 4\u00a0h using a new culture medium (100 \u03bcL/well) and 20 \u03bcL/well of MTT solution (5\u00a0mg/mL in PBS). After removing the supernatant, 100 \u03bcL of sterile dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to solubilize the formazan crystals. The absorbance at 540\u00a0nm was then recorded after 1\u00a0h using a microplate spectrophotometer (Spectrostar Nano, Germany). The experiment was carried out in triplicate and the cell viability percent was computed using Eq.\u00a0(3):3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Cell viability }\\%=\\frac{\\text{A}540\\text{ nm treated cells}}{\\text{A}540\\text{ nm untreated cells}}\\times 100$$\\end{document}Cell viability%=A540nm treated cellsA540nm untreated cells\u00d7100\n\n## Hemolysis\nThe non-hemolytic activity of the prepared VCM-HNLCs was assessed using a previously reported method [56, 57]. In summary, three washes of freshly collected sheep blood were performed using 0.1N sterile isotonic PBS (pH 7.4) by centrifugation at 3000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min. Next, 1.8\u00a0mL of six distinct concentrations of VCM-HNLCs formulation in 0.1N sterile PBS (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5\u00a0mg/mL), PBS (as negative control) and distilled water (as positive control) were separately mixed and incubated with 0.2\u00a0mL of the previously purified red blood cell suspension for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged using the ultracentrifuge (Centurion Scientific, UK) at 3000\u00a0rpm and 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. The supernatants of each sample were then collected into 96-well plates and their hemoglobin absorbances were quantitatively recorded at 540\u00a0nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M2, USA). The experiment was done in triplicate and the percentage of non-hemolytic activity was calculated using the following equation:4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Non}-\\text{hemolytic activity }\\%= 100-\\frac{(\\text{ABS}-{\\text{ABS}}_{0})}{({\\text{ABS}}_{100}-{\\text{ABS}}_{0})}$$\\end{document}Non-hemolytic activity%=100-(ABS-ABS0)(ABS100-ABS0)where ABS, ABS0 and ABS100 are the absorbances of the sample, positive and negative controls, respectively.\n\n## In vitro binding affinity study\nThe binding affinity of individual adjuvants (HA, Lys and HA-Lys conjugate), non-hybrid NLCs components and VCM-HNLCs to human TLR2 and TLR4 was determined and compared to their natural substrates, peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively, employing microscale thermophoresis (MST) on a Nano Temper Monolith NT.115 instrument (Nano Temper Technology, Germany) [58].\n\n## Determination of in vitro binding affinity to TLR2\nAccording to the manufacturer's protocol, recombinant human TLR2 was first adjusted to a concentration of 200\u00a0nM, labeled with the Monolith His-Tag labeling kit Red -tris-NTA, incubated for 30\u00a0min at room temperature and then centrifuged at 15,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After protein labeling, serial dilutions of different ligands with varying starting concentrations were prepared using an appropriate MST buffer (0.1\u00a0M PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Then, each dilution was mixed with an equivalent volume (10 \u00b5L) of the labeled TLR2 in a final concentration of 50\u00a0nM and the mixture was incubated for 10\u00a0min. Samples were then loaded into Standard Treated MST glass capillaries (Nano Temper Technology, Germany) and MST traces were measured using the Nano Temper Monolith NT.115 instrument at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 70% MST medium power. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The dissociation constant (Kd) for each ligand was adjusted using the Monolith-Affinity analysis program version 2.1.3 (Nano Temper Technologies, Germany).\n\n## Determination of in vitro binding affinity to TLR4\nIn the experiment, the concentration of recombinant human TLR4 was first adjusted to 3.6\u00a0\u00b5M and labeled with the Monolith NT.115 protein labeling kit Blue-NHS according to the manufacturer's protocol using a 1:3 protein-to-dye ratio. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15\u00a0min, protected from light, and then purified with a gel-filtration column. Following protein labeling, serial dilutions of various ligands were prepared using MST buffer (0.1\u00a0M PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) with different starting concentrations. Next, each dilution was supplemented with an equivalent volume of the labeled TLR4 (10 \u00b5L) at a final concentration of 20\u00a0nM and incubated for 10\u00a0min. Finally, the samples were loaded into Standard Treated glass MST capillaries (Nano Temper Technology, Germany) and MST traces were recorded in Nano Temper Monolith NT.115 instrument at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, blue LED and 80% MST power. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For every tested ligand, the dissociation constant (Kd) values were calculated using Monolith-Affinity analysis software version 2.1.3 (Nano Temper Technologies, Germany).\n\n## In vitro drug release study and linear kinetics\nThe release behavior of VCM from the VCM-HNLCs in response to different pH values (7.4 and 6.0) was evaluated using a dialysis bag method [58]. Briefly, 2\u00a0mL of pure VCM solution (1\u00a0mg/mL) and VCM-HNLCs solution (containing 1\u00a0mg/mL VCM) were separately placed in cellulose dialysis bags (molecular weight:14,400\u00a0Da) and the bags were shaken and dialyzed against 40\u00a0mL of the buffer of choice receiver solution (PBS pH 7.4 or 6.0) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0rpm. At predetermined intervals, 2\u00a0mL samples were withdrawn from the receiver solution and promptly replaced with an equivalent amount of fresh appropriate buffer (PBS pH 7.4 or 6.0) to maintain sink condition. The amount of VCM released per time was determined by HPLC according to the same analysis method mentioned for EE % evaluation (2.4.2). The experiment was performed in triplicate and the cumulative release percentage of VCM was calculated using the following equation:5\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Cumulative release }\\%=\\frac{{Q}_{t}}{{Q}_{v}}\\times 100$$\\end{document}Cumulative release%=QtQv\u00d7100where Qt is the amount of VCM released at time t, and Qv is the total amount of VCM previously used in the VCM-HNLCs formulation.\nDifferent mathematical models, including zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Krosmeyer-Peppas, Hixson-Crowell and Weibull, were then employed to examine the kinetics of VCM release from the VCM-HNLCs using the software program DDSolver [59]. The best-fit model was selected based on the correlation coefficient (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE), and the release mechanism was identified using Weibull and Krosmeyer-Peppas models by computing the values of the Weibull exponent parameter (\u03b2) and the release exponent (n), respectively.\n\n## Short-term physical stability study\nThe short-term colloidal stability of the prepared VCM-HNLCs formulation was evaluated at two different conditions: room temperature (25\u00a0\u00b0C) and cold temperature (4\u00a0\u00b0C) over 90\u00a0days of storage. Using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK) equipped with a 633\u00a0nm laser with detection optics of 173\u00b0, the mean particle size, PDI and ZP were measured at 0, 30, 60 and 90\u00a0days. All experiments were run in triplicate.\n\n## Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)\nThe antibacterial activity (MIC) of bare VCM, blank HNLCs and VCM-HNLCs against S. aureus and MRSA at pH 7.4 and 6.0 was investigated using a broth microdilution method, as previously reported [60]. In brief, S. aureus and MRSA cultures in Mueller- Hinton broth (MHB) were grown overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0rpm using a shaking incubator (Labcon, USA). The bacterial suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL) using a DEN-1B densitometer (Latvia) and further diluted to a final concentration of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u00a0CFU/mL. Then, 135 \u00b5L of MHB solution was pipetted into 96-well plates, and the treatments (bare VCM, blank HNLCs and VCM-HNLCs solutions) were added individually and serially diluted to obtain a range of concentrations. Thereafter, 15 \u00b5L of the bacterial suspension was added to each well, and the mixture was incubated for 72\u00a0h in the shaking incubator (Labcon, USA) adjusted at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0rpm. Following incubation, 5 \u00b5L of the sample mixtures were spotted on Mueller\u2013Hinton agar (MHA) plates at specified time intervals (24, 48, and 72\u00a0h). The MIC values were calculated after 24\u00a0h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. All experiments were performed in triplicate.\nBased on the MIC values obtained from the aforementioned antibacterial activity study, the cumulative FIC was determined to understand the combined antibacterial activity of the blank HNLCs and VCM in the VCM-HNLCs against S. aureus and MRSA at pH 7.4 and 6.0. Equations\u00a0(6) and (7) were used to calculate the \u03a3FIC and the FIC index is shown in Table S1.6\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{FIC }\\left({\\text{VCM}}\\right) = \\frac{\\text{ (the MIC of }{\\text{VCM}}\\text{ in combination with HNLCs) }}{\\text{(the MIC of VCM)}}$$\\end{document}FICVCM=(the MIC of VCM in combination with HNLCs)(the MIC of VCM)7\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{FIC }\\left(\\text{Blank }{\\text{HNLCs}}\\right) = \\frac{\\text{ (the MIC of }{\\text{HNLCs}}\\text{ in combination with VCM) }}{\\text{(the MIC of Blank }{\\text{HNLCs}}\\text{)}}$$\\end{document}FICBlank HNLCs=(the MIC of HNLCs in combination with VCM)(the MIC of Blank HNLCs)\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Sigma \\text{FIC}=\\text{FIC }(\\text{VCM})+\\text{FIC }(\\text{Blank HNLCs})$$\\end{document}\u03a3FIC=FIC(VCM)+FIC(Blank HNLCs)\n\n## Flow cytometry\nThe cell viability of MRSA in the population following the treatment with VCM and VCM-HNLCs for 18\u00a0h was assessed using a flow cytometry method [61]. To prepare the bacterial cultures, MRSA was grown overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0rpm in a shaking incubator to a concentration of 0.5 McFarland standard (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u00a0CFU/mL) in MHB. The grown bacteria were then collected by centrifugation at 3000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were resuspended in PBS and incubated for an additional 4\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Afterward, 15 \u00b5L of bacterial suspension at a concentration of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u00a0CFU/mL was added to a 96-well plate, each containing 135 \u03bcL of bare VCM and VCM-HNLCs formulations at the MIC concentrations of 7.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 3.9\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. The sample mixture was further incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a shaking incubator (100\u00a0rpm) for 18\u00a0h. Following incubation, 50 \u03bcL of each sample was transferred to the flow cytometry tubes containing 350 \u03bcL of sheath fluid and vortexed for 5\u00a0min. Then, 5 \u03bcL of membrane-impermeable propidium iodide (PI) and membrane-penetrating Syto9 dyes were added to each tube and the mixture was incubated for 30\u00a0min in the dark. Samples were analyzed on the flow cytometry device (BECKMAN COULTER DxFLEX, Nyon 1, USA), and at least 10,000 cells were collected in triplicate for each sample. Untreated MRSA cells were used as a negative control.\n\n## Crystal violet assay\nThe microtiter dish biofilm formation assay was employed to evaluate the ability of VCM-HNLCs to remove MRSA biofilms [62, 63]. Bacterial suspension in MHB at pH 7.4 and 6.0 (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009108\u00a0CFU/mL) was added to 96-well plates (200 \u03bcL/well) and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 7\u00a0days to create mature biofilms. Following incubation, the medium was removed from the wells and non-adherent bacterial cells were eliminated by washing the wells three times with a sterile PBS (pH 7.4 and 6.0). Thereafter, 200 \u03bcL of bare VCM solution and VCM-HNLCs formulation at a concentration of 10\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC were added to the wells and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The excess treatments and unattached bacteria were then removed by washing the wells three times in sterile PBS (pH 7.4 and 6.0), followed by staining of the biofilms with 0.01% w/v crystal violet solution for 15\u00a0min. Later, the excess dye was gently aspirated, thoroughly washed using PBS pH 7.4 and 6.0, and left to dry overnight. To elute the crystal violet stain, 30% acetic acid solution (125 \u03bcL) was added to each well ",
