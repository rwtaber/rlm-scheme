  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntibiotics have been widely used in the treatment of diseases in humans and animals and in the prevention of diseases in agriculture and aquaculture [1,2]. The global application amount of antibiotics has increased even more dramatically over the past decade [3], exacerbating the problem of antibiotic resistance (AMR). In the United States, it is reported that there are at least 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths each year, which are due to the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, such as bacteria or fungus [4]. In 2019, there were 4.95 million deaths globally attributed to antimicrobial resistance. This number is projected to increase to 10 million deaths per year by 2050 [5]. However, developing novel antimicrobial drugs is time-consuming, lengthy and costly, which makes the development of new antibiotics very difficult. Overall, addressing the issue of bacterial resistance has become more urgent.\nRecently, the combinations of antibiotics and Chinese medicine monomer and other substances without antibacterial activity provide an effective approach, which can help address the widespread emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains [6]. As research into drug resistance adva nces, increasing evidence suggests that externally administered metabolites or other substances can affect bacterial resistance, underscoring the intricate relationship between antibiotic resistance and bacterial metabolism [7,8]. Thymidine boosts the effectiveness of bactericidal antibiotics on Gram-negative pathogens by stimulating bacterial metabolism [9]; Gallic acid restores susceptibility of Streptococcus suis to sodium sulphadiazine by inhibiting tetrahydrofolate synthesis through regulation of dihydrofolate reductase expression [10]; exogenous alanine and/or glucose can promote TCA cycling and enhance bacterial uptake of antibiotics, thereby enhancing the killing effect of kanamycin on E. coli [11]; In summary, exogenous addition of metabolites to impact bacterial metabolism is an effective strategy to restore antibiotic susceptibility to multidrug-resistant bacteria.\nIn our previous studies, we found that purine metabolism was closely related to drug resistance, and Cheng ZX demonstrated that regulating purine metabolism can affect bacterial resistance to drug [12,13]. Guanosine (Guo) plays a crucial role in the purine metabolic pathway, as it combines guanine with a ribose ring through a \u03b2-N9 glycosidic bond. Additionally, Guo, as a purine nucleoside, offers neuroprotective qualities. Upon phosphorylation, Guo transforms into cyclic guanosine monophosphate, a secondary messenger essential for various physiological functions like visual transmission and gene expression and metabolic functions [14,15]. In bacteria, Guo is mainly involved in purine metabolism and the purine salvage pathway [16,17]. Guo regulates the metabolic reprogramming of bacteria. Guo enhances bacterial metabolism by optimizing the purine salvage pathway, leading to increased GTP levels and decreased levels of guanosine tetraphosphate and guanosine pentaphosphate ([p]ppGpp). By decreasing the production of (p)ppGpp, stringent responses are suppressed, thus minimizing the emergence of antibiotic resistance [13]. Through the purine metabolic pathway Guo is converted to guanine, which is readily oxidized to 8-oxoguanine because of its low redox potential. The 8-oxoguanine instead of guanine to participate in the replication of DNA will lead to DNA double-stranded breaks, which causes bacterial DNA damage. It has also been indicated that the oxidation of guanine to 8-oxo guanine is the basis of bactericidal antibiotics causing most bacterial deaths [18]. So, Guo is likely a potential antibiotic adjuvant.\nStreptococcus suis (S. suis), is a significant zoonotic pathogen with the potential to trigger meningitis, pneumonia, sepsis, arthritis, endocarditis, and other diseases in pigs, as well as infections and deaths in swine-related practitioners, thereby posing a threat to both the swine industry\u2019s growth and public health safety [19]. The Swine Streptococcosis disease, resulting from S. suis infection, stands out as the primary culprit behind pig fatalities and financial setbacks within the worldwide pig farming sector [20]. The widespread use of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics such as ceftiofur sodium (CEF) in the treatment of Swine Streptococcosis has led to increasing resistance of clinically isolated S. suis to drugs. In 2013\u20132015, the rate of resistance of clinically isolated Streptococcus suis to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics was extremely low (5%) [21], but in 2018\u20132022 clinically isolated S. suis reached a medium resistance level and showed multidrug resistance [22]. In recent years, about 8% of human Streptococcus suis strains in Thailand have shown reduced sensitivity to penicillin [23]. More than 20% of Streptococcus suis isolated from sick pigs in Spain and Italy were resistant to penicillin [24]. In China, the resistance rate of Streptococcus suis isolated to \u03b2-lactam drugs has increased to 22% [25]. In addition, more than 95% of Streptococcus suis isolated from some pig farms in Heilongjiang Province showed multi-drug resistance, and the resistance rate to penicillin and ceftiofur sodium was as high as 80% [26]. Even in some studies, more than 40% of S. suis are highly resistant to a variety of antibiotics, while only 10% of strains are sensitive to drugs [27]. In this research, we delved into the potential of Guo to amplify the antibacterial properties of CEF through both in vivo and in vitro supplementation. The mechanism that Guo enhances the antibacterial effect of CEF to reverse the drug resistance of S. suis was further investigated from the aspects of bacterial metabolism, oxidative stress, and affecting bacterial cell membranes. These findings introduce a fresh treatment protocol for combatting drug-resistant S. suis, drawing from a metabolic perspective.\n\n## Bacteria and reagents\nExcept when specified, S. suis quickly multiplies in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB, 98 Qingdao Hope Bio-technology) or on THB agar (THA) plates at 37\u00b0C. The S. suis strain ATCC 700,794 utilized in this research was procured from the American Type Culture Collection and has been preserved in our laboratory. Other strains were clinically isolated S. suis (119\u20131, M1\u20131, F2\u20134, D29, M11\u20132, G17\u20132 and D2) from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Harbin Veterinary Research Institute.\n\n## Antibiotics and chemicals\nCeftiofur sodium (CEF), Apramycin, Tilmicosin, Tylosin, Tetracycline, Sulfamethoxazole sodium, Florfenicol, Tulathromycin, Tiamulin and Guanosine (Guo) were purchased from Soraibao (Beijing, China).\n\n## MIC (minimal inhibit concentration) assay\nMICs of all compounds were determined by the standard broth microdilution method, according to the Yuan\u2019s method [28]. In short, we combined the compounds with an equal volume of bacterial broth that had 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFUs mL\u2009\u2212\u20091, and then we diluted it twofold in clear 96-well microtiter plates from Corning, New York, USA. The MIC was determined as the lowest drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed after 16\u2009~\u200924\u2009hours of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. All test samples underwent a minimum of three iterations for MIC assessments. The 1/2 MIC means the half of the minimal inhibit concentration concentration and the 1/4 MIC means the quarter of the minimal inhibit concentration concentration.\n\n## Checkerboard studies\nThe chequerboard assays measured the synergistic interaction between compounds and antibiotics along with the fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICI). In essence, each well of a 96-well plate was filled with 100\u2009\u00b5L of CAMHB, supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum. Antimicrobial agents were blended horizontally on the abscissa, while substances were blended vertically along the ordinate. The bacterial culture tested overnight was standardized to align with a 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard and subsequently diluted by a factor of 1:100 in CAMHB broth with the addition of 5% foetal bovine serum. After incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 18\u2009~\u200924\u2009h, The FIC index (FICI) was calculated according to the formula as follows.(1)FIC\u00a0index=MICab/MICa+MICba/MICb=FICa+FICb\nwhere MICa is the MIC of compound A alone, MICab is the MIC of compound A in combination with compound B, MICb is the MIC of compound B alone, MICba is the MIC of compound B in combination with compound A, FICa is the FIC index of compound A, and FICb is the FIC index of compound B. The interaction of compounds was categorized based on set criteria. A FICI value of less than or equal to 0.5 indicated synergy, a value between 0.5 and 1 indicated additivity, a value between 1 and 4 indicated indifference, and a value greater than 4 indicated antagonism.\n\n## Antibiotic survival assay\nIn order to achieve exponential and mid-stationary phase cultures in THB, the 16-hour culture was diluted 1:1000 in fresh medium and cultivated until reaching the desired level of turbidity (optical density at 600\u2009nm of 0.5). The culture was then collected and re-suspended in the THB medium. Different concentrations of Guo (0,5,10,15,20\u2009mm) were added and incubated in the medium with both 1/2MIC CEF. The control group for the incubation of S. suis did not involve any drug treatment. Following a 24-hour cultivation period, a sample was extracted to enumerate the S. suis colonies. The bacterial survival rate was determined by comparing the administration group to the blank control group. The findings are based on the average of three biological replicates, with the error bar indicating the standard deviation (SD).\n\n## Time-dependent killing curve\nS. suis in the exponential phase, with the initial amount adjusted to approximately 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL in THB. Subsequently, the culture underwent treatment with 5\u2009mm Guo, either in combination with CEF at 1/2MIC or 1/4MIC, or alone. 100\u2009\u03bcL aliquots were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24\u2009h intervals and subjected to 10-fold serial dilution before being plated on THB plates. The CFUs were then calculated after 24\u2009h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C. The colony forming units (CFU) refers to each colony formed after culture on an agar plate for a certain temperature and time, and is a unit for counting the number of bacteria or moulds.\n\n## Animal ethics statement\nThe animal experiments adhered to ethical animal research principles and received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Northeastern Agricultural University (NEAUEC20). All animals were treated humanely in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals. The animal experiment permit number :NEAUEC20240346. This study adhered to the \u201cARRIVE\u201d guidelines.\n\nGalleria mellonella larvae were acquired from Cade Ruixin International Trade Co. Ltd. of Tianjin, China, and kept in the dark at 15\u00b0C for up to two weeks before use. Only larvae weighing between 0.2 and 0.3 grams were selected for the experiment [29]. Sixty larvae of Galleria mellonella were divided into six groups at random, with each group consisting of ten larvae. They were then infected with 10\u2009\u03bcL of a strain of S. suis that is resistant to the infection, containing 1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009107 colony forming units (CFU), at the right posterior gastropod. Two hours after infection, G. mellonella larvae received treatment with Guo (10\u2009mg/kg), CEF (5\u2009mg/kg), or a combination of Guo and CEF (10\u2009mg/kg and 5\u2009mg/kg) in the left posterior region. Every experiment incorporated two negative controls. One group served as the no-operation control by not receiving an injection, thereby monitoring the background larvae mortality. The other group, known as the uninfected controls, received an injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to account for any potential impact of physical trauma on mortality. The larvae were housed in petri dishes under controlled conditions at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for up to 120\u2009hours post-injection, and their viability was assessed at 24-hour intervals. Larvae were deemed deceased if they displayed no movement following agitation of the petri dishes. The mortality rates of Galleria mellonella were documented over a five-day period.\n\n## Experimental mice, infection and sample collection\nTo evaluate the collaborative impact of Guo and CEF on S. suis, a systemic infection model employing mice was adopted. Specifically, six-week-old female ICR mice, bred in a germ-free environment, were procured from the Experimental Animal Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, located in Harbin, China. A total of 50 mice were used in this study. Twenty-five mice were used in the experiments to planar colony counting and 25 mice were used to histopathological examination. The mice were divided into five groups randomly for further experiments (n\u2009=\u200910). The group of mice were placed in cages, and the cages were labelled successively to avoid confusion. The animals were randomly allocated to experimental groups and processed for blind evaluation. Only the people in charge of data analysis know the grouping. The mice in the control group were intraperitoneally injected with 100\u2009\u03bcL of physiological saline to serve as a blank control. Except for the blank control group, all mice were intraperitoneally injection with 100\u2009\u03bcL of inoculum, which included 109 log-phase test strains. Two hours after modelling, mice in the model group were treated with 100\u2009\u03bcL PBS, mice in the Guo group were treated with 100\u2009\u03bcL Guo(10\u2009mg/kg), mice in the CEF group were treated with 100\u2009\u03bcL CEF (5\u2009mg/kg), and mice in the Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF group were treated with 100 \u03bcL Guo combined with CEF (10\u2009mg/kg and 5\u2009mg/kg). After injecting the mice with physiological salt as blank controls, both Guo and CEF were given through intraperitoneal administration. After 48\u2009hours the drug treatment, the mice were euthanized. Following that, the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of the mice were promptly gathered in normal saline, homogenized, appropriately diluted, and the CFU count was determined through planar colony counting.\n\n## Bacterial burden determination\nThe number of D29 CFU was determined in liver, spleen, lung, kidney and heart homogenates [30]. To correct for the differences in organ weight, four times the weight (in milligrams) in microlitres of sterile saline was added. The organs were homogenized at 4\u00b0C with a tissue homogenizer, which was carefully cleaned and disinfected with 70% ethanol after each homogenization. Next, serial 5-fold dilutions were made of each sample in sterile saline and 20\u2009\u03bcL of each dilution was plated onto THA plates. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2, and CFU were counted overnight, taking into account the dilution factor.\n\n## Histological examination\nThe samples destined for histopathological analysis were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 12\u2009hours, then dehydrated through an ethanol gradient, and embedded in paraffin. Four-micrometre sections, once dewaxed, underwent haematoxylin staining for 5\u2009minutes, followed by a 5-minute eosin counterstain.\n\n## Metabolite concentration detection\nLevels of guanine, GTP, ppGpp, pppGpp, and 8-oxo Guanine (Chenglin, China) were determined using content assay kits. The strain was incubated in THB medium for 3\u2009h at 37\u00b0C to an OD600\u2009nm of 0.5, The strain was added with Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF(1/2 MIC,64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) at 37 \u00b0C for 6\u2009h. and the bacterial cultures were collected, washed, resuspended in PBS. Following the process of sonication and centrifugation of a 1\u2009mL sample to disrupt the cells, the resulting supernatant was retrieved. Added the corresponding standard sample and examined as per the kit\u2019s guidelines for identifying the levels of metabolites present in the bacterial culture. This analysis was conducted thrice to ensure accuracy.\n\n## Measurement of enzyme activity\nThe activity of GUK, PNP, GTP-PK, and (p)ppGppS were determined using content assay kits. The strain was incubated in THB medium for 3\u2009h at 37\u00b0C to an OD600\u2009nm of 0.5, The strain was added with Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (1/2 MIC,64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) at 37 \u00b0C for 6\u2009h. and the bacterial cultures were collected, washed, resuspended in PBS. After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and reached according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and absorbance at 450\u2009nm was measured using the microplate reader. The activity of the corresponding enzyme was calculated by creating a standard curve and substituting the absorbance value of the sample. The assays were repeated three times.\nThe SOD level was assessed by using colorimetric assay kits obtained from Nanjing JianCheng Bioengineering Institute, China. Essentially, bacterial cultures were gathered, rinsed, reconstituted in lysis buffer (from the assay kits), and then disrupted via sonication. Following centrifugation at 8000\u2009g for 10\u2009minutes, the resulting supernatant was moved to a fresh tube and processed as per the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. The enzyme\u2019s activity was determined through the establishment of a standard curve and the replacement of the sample\u2019s absorbance value.\n\n## Quantification of metabolism-related genes by RT-qPCR\nTo evaluate the expression of genes associated with bacterial resistance and metabolism, Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was employed [31]. The metabolism-related genes examined were gmk, DeoD, relA, and relQ, all part of the purine metabolic pathway. The primer sequences utilized can be found in Table S5 of the supplementary materials. Bacterial cultures were harvested via centrifugation. Total RNA extraction was carried out using Omega products from China, and cDNA synthesis was performed following the instructions provided by TaKaRa, also based in China. The relative expression levels were standardized utilizing the 16S rRNA gene as an internal control [32]. The experimental procedure involved initial incubation at 94\u00b0C for 10\u2009minutes, followed by 40 cycles of amplification at 94\u00b0C for 15\u2009seconds and 60\u00b0C for 60\u2009seconds. Each sample underwent two separate analyses, and the data on gene expression were obtained from three different biological samples. All tests were conducted three times to ensure accuracy.\n\n## Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) assays\nThe strain was grown at 37 \u00b0C for 10\u2009h. The bacterial cultures were exposed to Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (1/2 MIC,64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) for 8\u2009h. In addition, a control group of bacterial cultures without drugs was established. Subsequently, the cultures were rinsed with 10\u2009mm PBS and then preserved by immersing them in 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight. The preserved cultures were gradually dehydrated using ethanol ranging from 50 to 100%. Following the deposition of a 150 \u00c5 thick layer of metal, the samples were examined using an SEM (Hitachi SU8010, Japan).\n\n## NAD+/NADH and Bacterial respiration determination\nThe strain was collected and diluted into OD600\u2009nm\u2009=\u20090.5 in THB. Then, the strain was added with Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (1/2 MIC,64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) at 37 \u00b0C. After 6\u2009h incubation, cell pellets were washed with 0.01\u2009M PBS (pH\u2009=\u20097.2) and resuspended with 200\u2009\u00b5L precooled extraction buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4 \u00b0C, and the supernatant was measured using NAD+/NADH Assay Kit with WST-8 (Beyotime, China).\nThe effect of guanosine on bacterial respiration was monitored by the reduction of iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT). Bacteria was collected and diluted into OD600\u2009nm\u2009=\u20090.5 in THB. Then, the strain was added with Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (1/2 MIC,64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) at 37 \u00b0C. 1\u2009mm INT was added and the solution was incubated for 1\u2009h in the dark. Absorbance at 485\u2009nm was measured during 60\u2009min.\n\n## CEF accumulation analysis\nThe ELISA method was utilized to investigate the accumulation of antibiotics in bacteria. In summary, the bacteria\u2019s overnight culture was thinned into 100\u2009mL of fresh THB and cultivated until reaching OD600\u2009nm\u2009=\u20090.5 at 37 \u00b0C. The bacterial cells were harvested, adjusted to 1012 CFUs/mL with 10\u2009mm PBS for utilization. Subsequently, Guo, CEF (1/2 MIC, 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) were introduced to the samples, and they were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with agitation for 20\u2009minutes. After three washes with PBS, the bacterial precipitation was diluted in 500\u2009\u03bcL of water, and the bacterial cells were ruptured using a cell disrupter. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 13,000\u2009g for 2\u2009minutes, and the supernatant was retrieved. Subsequently, the presence of antibiotics in the bacteria was analyzed diligently following the guidelines outlined in the instruction manual of the CEF Residue Detection Kit.\n\n## Efflux pump assay\nBriefly, bacteria were grown at 37 \u00b0C to an OD600\u2009nm of 0.5. The bacteria were washed and resuspended with 10\u2009mm PBS, and EtBr with a final concentration of 5\u2009\u03bcM was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1\u2009h. The mixture was centrifuged at 5000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4 \u00b0C, and the precipitate was collected and resuspended in fresh PBS. Following this, the suspension was divided into black 96-well microtiter plates and then Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (at a concentration of 1/2 MIC, 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (at concentrations of 5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) or CCCP, a recognized efflux pump inhibitor, was included. Lastly, the efflux of EtBr was observed over a period of 1 hour at 5-minute intervals using the microplate reader (with excitation at 530\u2009nm and emission at 600\u2009nm).\n\n## Membrane fluidity assays\nBacteria with an OD600\u2009nm of 0.8 was obtained by shaking the culture at 37 \u00b0C. Bacteria was then stained with 10\u2009\u03bcM of Laurdan and incubated for 10\u2009min at 37 \u00b0C protected from light. The cells were promptly gathered utilizing EP tubes warmed in advance and cleansed four times with 10\u2009mm PBS buffer that had been prewarmed. Subsequently, the cells were reconstituted to an OD600\u2009nm of 0.8 using a wash buffer. Stained cells (400\u2009\u03bcL) were introduced to 400\u2009\u03bcL of washing buffer enriched with Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (1/2 MIC, 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for an hour with periodic shaking. Finally, the mixed buffer was dispensed into a 96-well black microtiter plate, and the fluorescence was measured using the microplate reader (excitation: 350\u2009nm, emission: 460\u2009nm and 500\u2009nm; Laurdan GP\u2009=\u2009(I460\u2009\u2212\u2009I500)/(I460\u2009+\u2009I500).\n\n## Cell membrane integrity assay\nBacteria were cultured to an OD600\u2009nm of 0.5 and washed 2\u20133 times with sterile PBS. Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (1/2 MIC,64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), and Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) were added respectively and co-incubated for 15\u2009min, then 10\u2009nM/L propidium iodide (PI) was added. the fluorescence intensity at excitation wavelength of 535\u2009nm and emission wavelength of 615\u2009nm was measured within 1\u2009h.\n\n## Membrane depolarization assays\nThe bacteria were rinsed and mixed with a solution of HEPES (5\u2009mm) and glucose (5\u2009mm) buffer at pH 7.2 to create a culture with a concentration of 0.5 OD600\u2009nm. Subsequently, 190\u2009\u03bcL of the suspension was deposited into a black 96-well plate, and 5\u2009\u03bcM of 3,3-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5), from Aladdin, D131515) was introduced gradually over a span of 10\u2009minutes. Following a 30-minute interval, a combination of Guo at a concentration of 5\u2009mm, CEF at half of the minimum inhibitory concentration at 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL, and a mixture of Guo and CEF at 5\u2009mm and 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively, was introduced. At the same time, the microplate reader\u2019s excitation and emission wavelengths were adjusted to 622\u2009nm and 670\u2009nm, sequentially, for the purpose of measuring the dissipative membrane potential.\n\n## Proton motive force (PMF) assays\nThe pH-sensitive fluorescent probe BCECF-AM was employed to assess the PMF. To start, the bacterial suspensions underwent rinsing with a HEPES and glucose buffer at a pH of 7.2. Subsequently, 20\u2009\u03bcM of BCECF-AM was introduced and allowed to incubate at 37 \u00b0C. After stabilization of the fluorescence, Guo at a concentration of 5\u2009mm, CEF at 1/2 MIC (64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or a combination of Guo and CEF at 5\u2009mm and 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively, were introduced. The microplate reader\u2019s excitation and emission wavelengths were adjusted to 488 and 535\u2009nm, correspondingly, to monitor alterations in fluorescence readings.\n\n## ATP determination\nThe ATP levels within the bacterial cells were measured using an Enhanced ATP Assay Kit. Bacterial strain D29, which had been cultured overnight at 37 \u00b0C with agitation at a speed of 200 revolutions per minute, was washed and then re-suspended to reach an optical density at 600\u2009nm of 0.5 using a 0.01\u2009mol/L phosphate-buffered saline solution at a pH of 7.4. Following treatment with Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (at half the minimum inhibitory concentration, 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or a combination of Guo and CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) for 1 hour, the bacterial cultures were centrifuged at a force of 12,000 times gravity at 4 \u00b0C for 5\u2009minutes. Bacteria were broken down using lysozyme, then spun at 8000 rpm for 10\u2009minutes to isolate the supernatant for measuring intracellular ATP levels. After adding the detection solution to a 96-well plate and letting it sit at room temperature for 5\u2009minutes, the supernatants were swiftly mixed in and the luminescence was gauged using an Infinite microplate reader. Total ATP levels in samples were calculated based on the standard curve of luminescence signals versus concentrations of ATP standard solution.\n\n## ROS determination\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) were identified using a DCFH-DA-based assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) [31]. The specimens were cultured with 10\u2009mm DCFH-DA, then rinsed with PBS. Following this, the cells underwent treatment with CEF (1/2 MIC,64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), either with or without 5\u2009mm Guo. Samples were collected at specified intervals and utilized to track fluorescence levels under excitation at 488\u2009nm and emission at 525\u2009nm.\n\n## TUNEL assay\nIn the TUNEL assay, cells were cultivated until reaching an OD600\u2009nm of 0.5. Subsequently, aliquots were subjected to various treatments: Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (1/2 MIC, 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or a combination of Guo and CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) for a duration of 4\u2009hours. The cells were then fixed and labelled using the one-step TUNEL apoptosis assay kit provided by Beyotime Biotechnology in China. Following the labelling reaction, the cells underwent three washes with PBS and were observed under a fluorescence microscope.\n\n## DAPI assay\nThe investigation of DNA damage involved the utilization of DAPI (Sigma, USA) staining. The cells were cultivated to an OD600\u2009nm of 0.5, and portions were subjected to treatment with Guo (5\u2009mm), CEF (1/2 MIC, 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL), or Guo\u2009+\u2009CEF (5\u2009mm +64\u2009\u03bcg/mL) for a duration of 4\u2009hours. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to 1\u2009mg/L DAPI in darkness for 10\u2009minutes and rinsed thrice with PBS. The cells were then examined under a fluorescence microscope.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nData was gathered for statistical examination, and the student\u2019s t-test was performed with SPSS version 26.0 software. Results were presented as means with standard deviations. Growth patterns were modelled utilizing GraphPad Prism 8. The thresholds for various levels of statistical significance were determined as follows: ns for p\u2009>\u20090.05,\u2009*\u2009for p\u2009<\u20090.05, ** for p\u2009<\u20090.01, and*** for p\u2009<\u20090.001.\n\n## Guo enhances the sensitivity of \nPurine metabolism is an important differential metabolic pathway in tylosin-resistant S. suis and tylosin-sensitive S. suis [31]. Guo is a significantly downregulated metabolite in the purine metabolism pathway. Exogenous Guo can improve the sensitive of S. suis to Tylosin (Figure S1), suggesting that Guo is highly likely to be an antibiotic adjuvant. We selected standard strain ATCC700794 and 7 clinical isolates of S. suis, including 119\u20131, M1\u20131, F2\u20134, D29, M11\u20132, G17\u20132 and D2 as test strains (Figure S2), and determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CEF against the bacteria. The results showed that the MICs of the 8 strains against CEF were 0.0625, 0.25, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively (Table 1). Then we selected three strains of S. suis with different degrees of resistance, M1\u20131, D29, and D2, for subsequent in vitro phenotyping tests.Table 1.MICs for Streptococcus suis in this study.strainsMICs of CEF on strains (\u03bcg/mL)intepretationS. suis ATCC 700,7940.0625SS. suis 119\u201310.25SS. suis M1\u2013116RS. suis F2\u2013464RS. suis D29128RS. suis M11\u20132256RS. suis G17\u20132512RS. suis D21024RMIC inflection point of CEF: S\u2009\u2264\u20092; I\u2009=\u20094; R\u2009\u2265\u20098. S, sensitive (active substance normally effective against microorganisms at the recommended dosage); I, intermediate (active substance may be effective against microorganisms at higher than the recommended dose); R, resistant (active substance not effective against microorganism in either recommended or higher dosage due to resistance mechanism).\nGuo had essentially no effect on bacterial growth by determining the effect of different concentrations of Guo on bacterial survival (Figure 1a). The graded inhibitory concentration index (FICI) of Guo in combination with CEF of different strains were determined (Figure 1c and Table S1). The FICI were 0.26 (M1\u20131), 0.16 (D29), and 0.26 (D2), and the combined inhibitory effect was synergistic, which indicated that Guo could enhance the antibacterial effect of CEF in vitro. The effect of 1/2MIC CEF combined with different concentrations of Guo on the survival rate of clinically isolated S. suis D29 was determined, and the results showed that 1/2MIC CEF combined with different concentrations of Guo could significantly inhibit the survival rate of the bacterium, but it was not in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1b). Therefore, 5\u2009mm Guo was selected to determine the time-killing curves and verify the joint antibacterial effect with 1/2 MIC CEF or 1/4 MIC CEF, and the results showed that 5\u2009mm Guo had a significant inhibitory effect in the early exponential phase when it was combined with 1/2 MIC CEF and 1/4 MIC CEF (Figure 1 d\u2013g",
