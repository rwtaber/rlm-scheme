  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nSince the 1940s, the widespread use of antimicrobial drugs has dramatically improved the management of bacterial infections. However, the prolonged use of antibiotics has gradually exacerbated the problem of bacterial resistance, which has become a major global public health threat [1]. In recent years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly warned that antibiotic resistance is one of the most severe challenges facing global health [2]. As resistant strains spread rapidly, many common infections have become increasingly challenging to treat, particularly those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, which severely limit therapeutic options [3]. Among the various resistant pathogens, Escherichia coli (E. coli) poses a severe challenge due to its increasing resistance. E. coli, a common commensal bacterium found in the human and animal intestines, has evolved into a multidrug-resistant strain mainly due to the overuse of antibiotics in medical and agricultural fields [4,5]. In recent years, resistance in E. coli to commonly used antibiotics such as \u03b2-lactams, quinolones, and aminoglycosides has steadily increased [6,7,8]. According to data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net), the resistance rate of E. coli has reached nearly 50% in some countries. In parts of Asia and Africa, the rate is even higher [9]. This trend not only negatively affects patient outcomes but also increases the complexity of clinical treatments.\nEven more concerning is the rapid emergence of colistin-resistant E. coli, which has become a global focal point of concern [7]. As one of the last-line defenses against Gram-negative bacteria, colistin has long been considered an effective treatment for infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains. However, the first report of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1 in China in 2015 raised global alarm [10]. The horizontal transfer of the mcr-1 gene via plasmids has significantly accelerated the spread of colistin resistance. The discovery of this gene marks a critical turning point in the fight against colistin-resistant E. coli, as its transmission has expanded beyond humans to animals and the environment, greatly complicating public health control efforts [11,12]. A study revealed that over 15% of 847 samples tested positive for mcr-1-carrying E. coli, and several human infection cases were reported [13]. This phenomenon indicates that colistin-resistant E. coli not only exists widely in animal husbandry but can also be transmitted to humans through the environment and the food chain, further exacerbating the global resistance crisis. Faced with this threat, restoring the clinical efficacy of colistin has become crucial. Restricting colistin use in agriculture and animal husbandry is an important measure to slow the spread of resistance genes [14]. In addition, in clinical settings, combination therapies, such as colistin combined with meropenem or tigecycline, have shown some efficacy in countering resistant strains [15]. Overall, the multidrug resistance of E. coli, especially colistin resistance associated with the mcr-1 gene, has become one of the core challenges in global antibiotic resistance. Thus, limiting the misuse of antibiotics and developing new antimicrobial therapies to restore colistin\u2019s clinical efficacy is critical in addressing the colistin resistance crisis.\nScreening FDA-approved drug libraries has become one of the most effective approaches to identifying potential antibiotic adjuvants [16]. The FDA drug library includes many drugs that have already undergone extensive clinical testing, with proven safety and efficacy profiles. High-throughput screening of this drug library allows for the rapid identification of molecules with potential adjuvant properties. This approach not only accelerates the clinical translation of drugs but also reduces concerns about drug toxicity and safety [17]. Several drugs initially used for cancer, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory treatments have been found to inhibit bacterial resistance mechanisms during screening, demonstrating excellent antibacterial effects when combined with antibiotics [16,18,19,20]. These studies indicate that antibiotic adjuvant development holds significant potential, particularly in addressing the growing threat of resistant bacteria. Therefore, screening for potential colistin adjuvants using the FDA-approved drug library has become an essential strategy for extending the clinical use of colistin and offers promising therapeutic options in combating resistant bacterial infections. Whole-cell inhibition-based high-throughput screening enables the rapid evaluation of thousands of compounds to identify adjuvants that can synergize with colistin to counteract resistant bacteria [21]. This approach not only accelerates the discovery of colistin adjuvants but also provides new therapeutic options for colistin in treating multidrug-resistant infections. In this context, the FDA-approved drug library was an essential resource for adjuvant screening. The library includes thousands of drugs that have been validated for safety and efficacy [17]. Screening these drugs can rapidly identify molecules capable of restoring colistin sensitivity.\nIn this study, we utilized the FDA-approved drug library for high-throughput whole-cell inhibition screening of colistin adjuvants. The results revealed that cinacalcet hydrochloride (CH), an FDA-approved drug, exhibited significant potential as a colistin adjuvant. CH was initially used to regulate calcium receptors without drug-induced liver injury concern [22,23]. CH enhanced colistin\u2019s bactericidal effect against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, restoring colistin sensitivity, particularly in combating mcr-1-positive strains, which made CH a powerful drug for restoring colistin sensitivity. CH combination with colistin offers a new therapeutic approach for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the FDA-approved drug library could serve as an essential source for discovering antibiotic adjuvants, providing a practical solution to the global antibiotic resistance crisis.\n\n## 2.1. High-Throughput Whole-Cell Inhibition Screening Identified Cinacalcet Hydrochloride as a Colistin Adjuvant\nHigh-throughput whole-cell antibacterial screening technology is a rapid and effective method for drug screening, offering significant advantages. This method can quickly identify candidate drugs with synergistic antibacterial effects from large compound libraries, saving time and costs while ensuring the clinical relevance of the screening results by detecting antibacterial activity at the whole-cell level [21]. Therefore, in this study, we used a high-throughput whole-cell antibacterial screening method to search for potential drugs that could synergize with colistin from 800 FDA-approved drugs. As shown in Figure 1A, among the 800 drugs initially screened, 43 drugs demonstrated significant antibacterial effects when combined with colistin (OD600 < 0.2). After excluding some conventional antibiotics and previously reported drugs, we randomly selected four drugs that exhibited antibacterial effects when combined with colistin and three drugs that did not, to test the feasibility of the screening method. As shown in Table 1, under consistent concentration conditions, the four effective drugs in the initial screening also restored colistin sensitivity in multidrug-resistant bacteria. In comparison, the three ineffective drugs did not, which demonstrated the reliability of the screening method used in this study. Finally, we selected cinacalcet hydrochloride (CH), which showed the best synergistic effect among the four drugs, for further study. The structural formula is shown in Figure 1B.\n\n## 2.2. Synergistic Antibacterial Effect of CH and COL on Multidrug-Resistant E. coli\nTo further evaluate the synergistic antibacterial effect of cinacalcet hydrochloride and colistin, we performed MIC tests on clinical MDR E. coli isolates. As shown in Table S1, these clinical isolates were all multidrug-resistant strains, and six of them were mcr-1-positive (Figure S1). Except for the MIC value of CH against the standard E. coli strain ATCC25922, which was 32 \u00b5g/mL, the MIC values of CH against the remaining clinical strains ranged from 64 to 256 \u00b5g/mL, and for some strains, the MIC value exceeded 256 \u00b5g/mL, indicating weak or no antibacterial activity of CH on its own (Table S1). Next, this study randomly selected three mcr-1-positive and three mcr-1-negative strains for checkerboard analysis to test the combined effect of CH and colistin E. The results showed that the combination of colistin E and cinacalcet hydrochloride exhibited synergy in all strains, with FICI values below 0.5.\nSpecifically, the FICI values for the three mcr-1-positive strains, E. coli 1704087, E. coli 16867, and E. coli 42, were 0.047, 0.094, and 0.063, respectively (Figure 2). Similarly, the FICI values for the three mcr-1 negative strains, E. coli 1351, E. coli 1347, and E. coli 1808106, were 0.078, 0.094, and 0.094, respectively (Figure 2). This confirmed the synergistic effect of CH and colistin E in both colistin-resistant and non-colistin-resistant strains. Overall, the data further demonstrated that CH not only restored colistin E sensitivity in colistin-resistant strains but also enhanced the antibacterial activity of colistin in colistin-sensitive strains.\n\n## 2.3. Bactericidal Effect of CH and COL on mcr-1-Positive MDR E. coli\nColistin, as a peptide antibiotic, has been used as a last line of defense in treating MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections. However, the emergence of mcr-1 has significantly reduced the effectiveness of colistin, limiting its clinical use in treating resistant infections [10]. Therefore, subsequent experiments focused on evaluating the bactericidal activity of CH and colistin in mcr-1-positive MDR E. coli. The growth curve of mcr-1-positive MDR E. coli 42 (Figure 3A) showed that bacterial OD600 values increased over time in both the control group and in groups treated with either colistin (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) or CH (8 \u03bcg/mL). However, bacterial growth was significantly inhibited when CH and colistin were used together. In the group treated with CH (8 \u03bcg/mL) and colistin (0.0625 \u03bcg/mL), OD600 values remained unchanged for the first 8 h but increased slightly afterward, although still lower than in the control and single-drug groups (Figure 3A). In the groups treated with CH (8 \u03bcg/mL) and colistin (0.5 \u03bcg/mL or 0.25 \u03bcg/mL), OD600 values remained nearly constant, indicating potent inhibition of bacterial growth (Figure 3A). Subsequently, time-kill curves were used to assess bacterial CFU counts over time (0\u20138 h) in different treatment combinations. Results showed that bacterial CFU counts remained high in the control group and groups treated with either colistin (0.5 \u03bcg/mL) or CH (8 \u03bcg/mL), indicating normal bacterial proliferation (Figure 3B). However, the combination treatment of CH and colistin significantly reduced bacterial CFU counts, with the most pronounced bactericidal effect observed in the groups treated with CH (8 \u03bcg/mL) and colistin (0.5 \u03bcg/mL), where CFU counts rapidly decreased to 102 CFU/mL within 8 h (Figure 3B). However, whether the bactericidal effect of the combination of CH and colistin improved with increasing CH concentration still required further experimental validation to explore the optimal ratio of the two agents. Overall, these data demonstrated the significant synergistic antibacterial effect of CH and colistin in mcr-1-positive MDR E. coli.\n\n## 2.4. The Effect of CH Combined with COL on Biofilm Formation and Eradication in mcr-1-Positive MDR E. coli\nBiofilm formation in E. coli is an important survival strategy in adverse environments. Biofilms not only allow bacteria to colonize host tissues but also enhance their resistance to antibiotics and the host immune system [24]. This study further evaluated the inhibitory and eradication effects of CH and colistin on bacterial biofilm in mcr-1-positive E. coli. In the biofilm inhibition assay, colistin (2 \u03bcg/mL) alone was able to reduce biofilm formation, but the effects were limited (Figure 4A). Biofilm mass in the colistin group was significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.01), while there was no significant difference between the CH group and the control (Figure 4A). However, when CH and colistin were used together, biofilm mass was significantly reduced and almost completely inhibited (p < 0.0001), indicating an apparent synergistic inhibitory effect (Figure 4A). In the biofilm eradication assay, colistin alone showed limited efficacy in clearing established biofilms, with the impact being weaker than the control (p < 0.05) (Figure 4B). However, the combination of CH and colistin significantly enhanced biofilm eradication, and the residual biofilm mass was markedly reduced compared to the control group (p < 0.001), demonstrating a strong synergistic clearing effect (Figure 4B). Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy images revealed the impact of different treatments on biofilm structure. The biofilms in the control group and those treated with either colistin or CH alone were thick and covered most of the visual field (Figure 4C). In contrast, after the combined treatment, the intensity of the green fluorescence signal from live bacteria was significantly reduced. The density and thickness of the biofilm were markedly decreased, indicating a substantial reduction in the number of live bacteria within the biofilm (Figure 4C). Both the data and imaging results consistently showed that the combination of colistin and CH had a significant effect on biofilm inhibition and eradication.\n\n## 2.5. CH and Colistin Combination Caused Bacterial Membrane Damage\nTo explore the mechanism underlying the synergistic antibacterial effect of CH and colistin, this study examined membrane permeability, intracellular and extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) changes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO) production in E. coli. N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) fluorescence was used to assess outer membrane permeability, as NPN enters cells and emits fluorescence only when the membrane is damaged. For the mcr-1-positive MDR E. coli 42, NPN fluorescence revealed no significant changes in outer membrane permeability when CH was used at concentrations of 8\u201332 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 5A). Similarly, colistin alone (0.125 \u03bcg/mL) did not significantly alter NPN fluorescence (Figure 5A). However, the combination of CH (32 \u03bcg/mL) and colistin (0.125 \u03bcg/mL) significantly increased NPN fluorescence, with the highest fluorescence observed, indicating a synergistic effect in disrupting the outer membrane (Figure 5A). Similarly, Propidium Iodide (PI) fluorescence was used to assess changes in inner membrane permeability. The combination of CH and colistin in MDR E. coli 42 also significantly increased PI fluorescence, indicating increased inner membrane permeability and further demonstrating that the bacterial membrane integrity was compromised (Figure 5A). In contrast, neither CH (8\u201316 \u03bcg/mL) nor colistin (0.125 \u03bcg/mL) alone had a significant effect on PI fluorescence (Figure 5A). However, when CH was used alone at 32 \u03bcg/mL, a significant increase in PI fluorescence was observed (Figure 5A). To further explore the effect of CH when used alone, we examined its impact on the membrane of the standard E. coli strain ATCC25922. As shown in Figure 5B, NPN fluorescence revealed that CH started to affect the outer membrane at a concentration of 16 \u03bcg/mL. In contrast, PI fluorescence showed that CH affected the inner membrane at 8 \u03bcg/mL, indicating that CH alone could increase membrane permeability. Additionally, ATP leakage assays were performed to further assess the impact of the CH and colistin combination on bacterial membrane integrity. In both E. coli 42 and E. coli ATCC25922, the combination of CH and colistin resulted in the highest levels of extracellular ATP (p < 0.0001), consistent with increased membrane permeability. Meanwhile, the lowest levels of intracellular ATP were observed in the combination treatment group (p < 0.0001) (Figure 5C). Furthermore, ROS assays revealed that the combination of CH and colistin significantly increased ROS production in both E. coli 42 and E. coli ATCC25922, with fluorescence signals reaching their highest values (p < 0.0001) (Figure S2A,B). However, when measuring NO production, no significant changes were observed, suggesting that the combination of CH and colistin does not affect NO levels under the experimental conditions, and the mechanism may not be related to nitrogen stress (Figure S2C,D). These data suggested that the combination of CH and colistin induced strong oxidative stress and disrupted the bacterial membrane structure, ultimately leading to bacterial death.\n\n## 2.6. Safety Evaluation of CH and COL Combination Therapy\nThe safety of colistin use is significantly limited by its nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, especially at high doses or with prolonged use, which reduces its therapeutic efficacy [25]. To assess whether CH affected the toxicity of colistin, we analyzed the hemolysis and cytotoxicity of colistin in the presence of CH. The hemolysis assay of the drug combination showed that as the concentration of colistin increased, the hemolysis rate of red blood cells treated with the drug combination (red, 4 \u03bcg/mL) remained at low levels, almost close to 0%, compared to red blood cells untreated with CH (blue, 0 \u03bcg/mL) (Figure 6A). This indicates that the addition of CH did not increase the hemolytic effect of colistin. Figure 6B shows the effect of colistin alone and in combination with CH on the viability of J774.A1 macrophage cells. As the concentration of colistin increased, cell viability significantly decreased. At a colistin concentration of 2.5 mg/mL, the viability of cells dropped to about 20%, while cells in the presence of CH dropped to close to 80%, with this difference being statistically significant (****, p < 0.0001). At the highest concentration (5 mg/mL), cell viability in all treatment groups dropped to nearly 0%, indicating high toxicity of colistin at this concentration, causing almost complete cell death. However, adding CH did not increase the toxicity of colistin towards eukaryotic cells. These data indicated the safety of combining CH with colistin.\n\n## 2.7. Protective Effect of CH and COL Combination Therapy in Animal Models of mcr-1-Positive Bacterial Infection\nTo further understand the therapeutic potential of combining CH with colistin in treating mcr-1-positive bacterial infections, animal experiments were conducted using animal models infected with mcr-1-positive E. coli 42. In the Galleria mellonella larva bacterial infection model, the appearance of larvae in different treatment groups was observed after infection with 10\u2076 CFU of bacteria, and their survival was recorded. The larvae in the control group and single-drug treatment groups appeared dull, showing severe lesions and damage, whereas the larvae in the CH + COL group (2 + 2 mg/kg) exhibited significantly less infection damage (Figure 7A). In the survival statistics, all larvae in the control group died within 2 days post-infection, while those in the CH group all died within 3 days. The survival rate in the COL group was also low, with only 20% of larvae surviving (Figure 7A). In contrast, the survival rate in the CH + COL group significantly increased, with about 70% of the larvae still alive on day 4 (Figure 7A), demonstrating a significant protective effect of the combination therapy in the wax moth model. Similarly, in the mouse acute lethal sepsis model, all mice in the control group and single-drug treatment groups died within 3 days of infection (Figure 7B). However, the CH + COL groups with two different doses (2 + 2 mg/kg and 10 + 2 mg/kg) improved the survival rate of the infected mice, increasing survival to 20% and 60%, respectively (Figure 7B). Next, a sublethal dose of 1 \u00d7 108 bacteria was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of CH and colistin in infected mice. After 12 h of treatment, the bacterial load in the organs, tissue pathology, and blood levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured. Compared to the untreated group, both the colistin and combination groups showed a significant reduction in bacterial load in the liver, with an average decrease of 0.38 and 1.81 log units, respectively (Figure 7C). In the spleen, although there was no statistically significant difference between the combination group and the control group, the combination group had the most significant reduction in bacterial load compared to the other groups (Figure 7C). In the serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, the CH + COL group (10 + 1 mg/kg) had significantly lower levels than the control group, with the combination group exhibiting the lowest levels of inflammatory cytokines, indicating that the combination therapy effectively suppressed the release of inflammatory factors (Figure 7D). Finally, in the pathological examination of lung tissue from the different groups, the control group and single-drug treatment groups showed severe lung tissue damage, including significant hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 7E). In contrast, the CH + COL group (10 + 1 mg/kg) displayed relatively intact lung tissue structure, reduced inflammatory infiltration, and significantly improved pathology (Figure 7E). These experiments demonstrated that the effect of combination therapy was significantly better than using colistin or CH alone, suggesting that this combination strategy held potential clinical application value for treating infections caused by mcr-1-positive bacteria.\n\n## 3. Discussion\nThe discovery of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-1, particularly its widespread dissemination in E. coli, has severely compromised colistin\u2019s clinical efficacy [10]. Exploring novel antimicrobial strategies to restore colistin\u2019s clinical effectiveness has become a key focus in infection treatment research. This study aimed to utilize a high-throughput screening method to identify drugs that could restore colistin\u2019s antibacterial activity, focusing on the combination of CH and colistin against mcr-1-positive multidrug-resistant E. coli. Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, the research found that the combination of CH and colistin exhibited a significant synergistic effect in mcr-1-positive strains. This not only provides a new therapeutic strategy for restoring colistin\u2019s antibacterial efficacy but also offers novel insights and approaches for combating the growing crisis of multidrug resistance.\nSeveral studies have explored the use of combination therapies to enhance colistin\u2019s antibacterial effects and overcome resistance. Tac\u00e3o et al. (2017) demonstrated that the combination of colistin and meropenem showed significant synergy against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, particularly in inhibiting mcr-1-positive strains [26]. Similarly, Zhou et al. (2020) further confirmed that combining colistin with tigecycline enhanced its antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria [27]. In contrast, this study innovatively introduced the FDA-approved compound CH as a potential adjuvant for colistin. The results showed that the combination of CH and colistin exhibited significant synergy in mcr-1-positive E. coli. Notably, unlike antibiotics such as meropenem and tigecycline, CH did not have direct antibacterial activity [22]. In MIC tests against multidrug-resistant E. coli, CH had MIC values ranging from 64 to 256 \u00b5g/mL, indicating weak or no antibacterial effect when used alone. However, when combined with colistin, its synergistic effect significantly enhanced colistin\u2019s antibacterial activity. This finding was more valuable than existing antibiotic combination strategies, as CH, a non-antibiotic drug [22,28], can reduce the required antibiotic dosage, thus minimizing the risk of resistance development. Similarly, the FDA-approved non-antibiotic drug melatonin has likewise proven to be a promising colistin adjuvant against mcr-1-positive Gram-negative pathogens [20]. This study is the first to demonstrate the advantages of CH in combination therapy, showing that it not only enhances colistin\u2019s antibacterial potency but also allows for a reduced colistin dosage and exhibits high safety. This also suggests that non-antibiotic drugs hold significant potential in restoring the efficacy of traditional antibiotics.\nThe combination of colistin and CH demonstrated significant synergistic antibacterial effects both in vitro and in vivo, which aligned with findings from Wang et al. regarding enhanced antibiotic efficacy through combination therapy [29,30]. Although compared to the FICI index, there was little difference in the effectiveness of CH in combination with colistin against colistin-resistant and susceptible strains. However, it seemed that the combination of CH and colistin was more effective against colistin-resistant strains than colistin-sensitive strains from the heat map displayed by the checkerboard method. This also differed from some reports in the references [31,32,33]. Here, we hypothesize that other mechanisms of action still exist for the synergistic antimicrobial action of CH and colistin, which need to be further explored. Additionally, this study found that the combination of colistin and CH not only inhibited biofilm formation but also significantly eradicated pre-formed biofilms, offering new possibilities for treating biofilm-associated infections. Previous studies have shown the potential of antibiotic combination strategies in treating biofilm infections [34]. The results of this study further support this notion and provide evidence for a novel drug combination. To investigate the mechanism of synergy between colistin and CH, this study further analyzed their effects on bacterial membrane permeability, intracellular and extracellular ATP levels, and ROS production. The combination of CH and colistin significantly increased ROS production in bacteria, suggesting that oxidative stress plays a key role in their bactericidal mechanism. This finding is consistent with the study by Kohanski et al. (2007), which highlighted the critical role of oxidative stress in bacterial death [35]. However, NO production did not show significant changes under the experimental conditions, suggesting that the combination had a limited effect on bacterial nitrogen stress responses, providing directions for future studies on other bacterial stress responses.\nThe clinical use of colistin is limited by its nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity [36]. CH is an orally active, allosteric agonist of Ca receptor (CaR) and is used for cardiovascular disease treatment and parathyroid hyperplasia [22,28]. This study initially evaluated the safety of the CH and colistin combination in cell-based experiments, finding that the combination did not increase hemolysis of red blood cells or significantly increase macrophage cytotoxicity. On the contrary, the addition of CH reduced colistin\u2019s cytotoxicity in some cases, suggesting that CH may have the potential to mitigate colistin\u2019s toxicity. This finding offers a new approach to reducing the adverse effects of colistin in future clinical applications. Furthermore, the results from animal experiments support the clinical potential of combination therapy, demonstrating the potential clinical value of this combination strategy. This was also evident in previous studies reporting that combination therapy showed great therapeutic potential, whether the treatment was administered intraperitoneally or by gavage [31,32,37]. Despite the significant findings, there are limitations to this study. The research primarily focused on in vitro experiments and animal models, and the safety and efficacy of the CH and colistin combination have yet to be validated in larger clinical trials. Additionally, the study did not explore the potential of CH and colistin in other resistant bacterial strains. Future studies could expand to other multidrug-resistant pathogens to investigate the broader antibacterial applicability of this combination.\n\n## 4.1. Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Drugs\nE. coli ATCC25922 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Clinical isolates of E. coli (1240, 1351, 17039, 1347, 1808106, 19097, 17039, 1244, 1704086, and 42) were isolated from porcine clinical samples and identified and stored by our laboratory.
