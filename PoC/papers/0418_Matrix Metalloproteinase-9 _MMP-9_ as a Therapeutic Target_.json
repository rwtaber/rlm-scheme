  "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that plays a central role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, angiogenesis, immune cell trafficking, and cytokine activation. Dysregulated MMP-9 activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse conditions, including atherosclerosis, aneurysm formation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, neurodegeneration, and malignancy. Although broad-spectrum synthetic MMP inhibitors were initially developed as therapeutic agents, clinical trials failed due to lack of selectivity, poor tolerability, and impairment with physiological tissue repair. This outcome has shifted attention toward indirect pharmacological modulation of MMP-9 using drugs that are already approved for other indications. In this paper, we review the evidence supporting MMP-9 modulation by established therapeutics and adjunctive strategies. Cardiometabolic agents such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), metformin, and pioglitazone reduce MMP-9 expression and enzymatic activity, contributing to vascular protection, improved insulin sensitivity, and attenuation of aneurysm progression. Anti-inflammatory and respiratory drugs, including glucocorticoids, phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, montelukast, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), suppress MMP-9-driven airway inflammation and pathological tissue remodeling in asthma, COPD, and acute lung injury. Tetracycline derivatives, particularly sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline, directly inhibit MMP-9 activity and are clinically validated in the treatment of periodontal disease and vascular remodeling. Hormone-related therapies such as rapamycin, estradiol, and tamoxifen exert tissue- and disease-specific effects on MMP-9 within endocrine and oncologic pathways. In parallel, nutritional interventions-most notably omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant vitamins-provide adjunctive strategies for mitigating MMP-9 activity in chronic inflammatory states. Taken together, these findings position MMP-9 as a modifiable and clinically relevant therapeutic target. The systematic integration of approved pharmacologic agents with lifestyle and nutritional interventions into disease-specific treatment paradigms may facilitate safer, context-specific modulation of MMP-9 activity and unveil novel opportunities for therapeutic repurposing.",

  "full_text": "## Structural and Functional Overview of MMP-9 in the ECM\nMatrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), or gelatinase B, is a multi-domain zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidase whose structural organization directly determines its biochemical versatility and tight regulatory control. The N-terminal pro-domain contains the conserved cysteine-switch motif (PRCGVPD) in which a cysteine residue coordinates the catalytic zinc ion to maintain zymogen latency until proteolytic removal of the pro-peptide enables activation [1]. Crystallographic studies of the catalytic domain reveal that the active-site zinc is coordinated by three histidine residues (His401, His405, His411) with an essential Glu402 in the human enzyme. The catalytic domain also harbors a second structural zinc and multiple (at least five) calcium ions which stabilize the overall structural conformation and promote substrate recognition. Unique among the gelatinase subgroup, MMP-9 contains three fibronectin type II (FnII) repeats embedded within its catalytic domain; these modules form a collagen/gelatin-binding exosite that greatly enhances binding affinity for denatured collagen, elastin, and basement-membrane components and thereby increase proteolytic efficiency of large macromolecular substrates. A flexible O-glycosylated linker (hinge region) connects to the C-terminal hemopexin-like (PEX) domain, a ~\u2009200-residue four-bladed \u03b2-propeller structure that coordinates substrate specificity, homodimerization and natural inhibition via TIMP-1 docking [2,3]. Post-translational modifications (for example N-glycosylation at Asn38 and Asn120) further modulate secretion, stability and pericellular localization rather than catalytic rate per se. Collectively, this modular architecture couples precise enzymatic activation control with strategic substrate engagement and localization, positioning MMP-9 as a central effector of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cytokine and growth-factor release, barrier disruption and cell-migration dynamics. These structure-to-function relationships support both its essential physiological roles in development, angiogenesis and tissue repair and its pathological nature to drive maladaptive remodeling, chronic inflammation and metastatic dissemination when dysregulated [4,5].\nRecent evidence further expands the concept of dual role of MMP-9 in health and disease [6,7,8]: Elevated serum MMP-9 levels are strongly associated with severe outcomes in acute inflammatory syndromes such as COVID-19 (with the significant weighted mean difference ~246 ng/mL in severe versus non-severe cases), indicating that MMP-9 upregulation parallels systemic proteolytic burden and acute tissue injury [9]. In chronic lung disease, patients with COPD display significantly higher serum MMP-9 and elevated MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios, which correlate negatively with lung-function parameters such as FEV1 and FEV1/FVC, underlying the role of MMP-9 in airway remodeling and functional decline [10]. In the vascular biology, a 2024 Mendelian-randomization analysis has implicated MMP-9 expression as causally linked to thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm risk, thereby linking proteolytic imbalance to structural vascular failure [11]. In fibrotic disorders, MMP-9 is pivotal player in progressing fibrosis across organs, not only by degrading ECM but also by releasing profibrotic mediators and enabling fibroblast migration, thereby converting repair into maladaptive scarring [12]. Taken together, these findings clarify our understanding of MMP-9\u2019s pathologic significance: it is not just a marker of matrix turnover, but a mechanistic effector in acute injury, chronic remodeling, barrier compromise, and progressive organ dysfunction.\n\n## 1.2. The Role of MMP-9 Angiogenesis and Vascular Remodeling\nAngiogenic regulation represents another critical dimension of MMP-9 function. Through proteolytic degradation of basement membranes and interstitial ECM components, MMP-9 releases matrix-sequestered growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), thereby amplifying local proangiogenic signaling and sustaining tumor vascularization and progression [13]. Experimental evidence demonstrates that MMP-9 deficiency compromises angiogenic responses, whereas its overexpression enhances neovascularization under both physiological and pathological conditions. Beyond mobilizing angiogenic growth factors, MMP-9 also generates bioactive ECM fragments, such as endostatin, that can exert tissue-dependent pro- or anti-angiogenic effects. This dualistic activity reflects the tightly controlled regulation of MMP-9 during angiogenesis, where transient activation facilitates tissue repair, while persistent overexpression drives pathological vascular remodeling in cancer, retinopathy, and chronic inflammatory disorders [14].\n\n## 1.3. MMP-9 in Leukocyte Trafficking and Immune Regulation\nImmune cell transmigration critically depends on the proteolytic activity of MMP-9. During inflammation, leukocytes must breach the basement membrane and interstitial ECM; by cleaving type IV collagen, laminin, and other basal membrane components, MMP-9 forms localized biotracks that facilitate neutrophil and macrophage extravasation [15]. Beyond degrading structural barriers, MMP-9 shapes the inflammatory milieu by processing chemokines such as CXCL8/interleukin-8 (IL-8) and cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), thereby enhancing leukocyte recruitment and amplifying inflammatory signaling [16]. Experimental studies reveal that MMP-9-deficient mice display markedly reduced neutrophil infiltration into inflamed tissues, underscoring its non-redundant role in innate immunity. However, while MMP-9 activity is indispensable for effective host defense, its excessive or sustained expression drives chronic inflammatory pathology by perpetuating leukocyte infiltration and tissue injury, as seen in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic pulmonary disorders [17]. Thus, MMP-9 functions as both a gatekeeper, enabling leukocyte passage across extracellular barriers, and an amplifier, intensifying immune cell trafficking: outcomes governed by the magnitude and temporal regulation of its activity.\n\n## 1.4. Cytokine and Chemokine Processing by MMP-9\nBeyond structural remodeling of the ECM, MMP-9 exerts critical immunomodulatory functions through the proteolytic processing of cytokines and chemokines. By cleaving and modifying these signaling mediators, MMP-9 alters their bioavailability, receptor affinity, and downstream biological effects [18,19]. For instance, proteolytic activation of pro-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (pro-TNF-\u03b1) enhances its pro-inflammatory potency, whereas MMP-9-mediated truncation of IL-8/CXCL8 generates N-terminally clipped isoforms with increased neutrophil chemotactic activity. Similarly, MMP-9 processing of chemokines such as CXCL5 and CXCL12 can either amplify or attenuate leukocyte recruitment, depending on the cellular and tissue microenvironment [20,21]. These post-translational modifications constitute an additional regulatory layer of immune control that cannot be achieved through transcriptional regulation alone. By proteolytically regulating cytokine and chemokine activity, MMP-9 functions as a molecular modulator, calibrating both the amplitude and duration of inflammatory cascades. When this regulation is lost, the balance shifts toward pathological inflammation, as seen in autoimmune diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sepsis\u2014conditions in which excessive chemokine activation drives excessive leukocyte infiltration and collateral tissue damage [22]. Conversely, insufficient MMP-9 activity can impair inflammatory resolution and impair tissue repair. This bidirectional role underscores why emerging therapeutic strategies increasingly emphasize state-specific modulation of MMP-9 activity rather than indiscriminate inhibition [23].\n\n## 1.5. Growth Factor Activation and Fibrotic Remodeling Mediated by MMP-9\nA central mechanism by which MMP-9 governs tissue responses beyond ECM remodeling involves the proteolytic activation of growth factors such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), VEGF, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which are normally sequestered within the ECM in latent or binding-protein-associated forms [24]. Through cleavage of matrix scaffolds and carrier proteins, MMP-9 releases these immobilized factors into the pericellular milieu, increasing their bioavailability and receptor engagement. This activity promotes fibroblast activation, myofibroblast differentiation, and matrix protein deposition\u2014hallmarks of fibrotic remodeling in the lung, kidney, and cardiovascular system [25]. In vascular tissues, MMP-9-mediated release of VEGF and PDGF stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation and vessel wall remodeling\u2014responses that are beneficial during repair but pathogenic in aneurysm expansion and atherosclerotic plaque destabilization [26,27]. Within the tumor microenvironment, MMP-9-dependent release of matrix-bound growth factors amplifies proangiogenic signaling, activates stromal fibroblasts, and drives epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby promoting neovascularization, invasive growth, and metastatic dissemination [28]. Collectively, these findings identify MMP-9 as a pivotal regulator of growth factor bioavailability, linking extracellular proteolysis to fibrotic, vascular, and neoplastic remodeling [23,24,25,26,27,28,29].\n\n## 1.6. MMP-9 as a Biomarker and Therapeutic Target in Neurological Disease\nDisruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is a hallmark of numerous acute and chronic neurological disorders, with MMP-9 acting as a central effector. By proteolytically degrading tight junction proteins, including claudin-5, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), MMP-9 compromises endothelial integrity and induces pathological increases in paracellular permeability [30]. This enzymatic activity primes the unregulated influx of plasma proteins, leukocytes, and neurotoxic molecules into the brain parenchyma, amplifying neuroinflammation and vasogenic edema. In experimental models of ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis, early surges in MMP-9 correlate closely with BBB breakdown and worsened neurological outcomes [31]. Beyond junctional degradation, MMP-9 destabilizes the neurovascular interface by cleaving basement membrane components and releasing matrix-bound mediators that sustain endothelial dysfunction [26]. Elevated MMP-9 levels in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma are consistently associated with hemorrhagic transformation following thrombolytic therapy in stroke, highlighting its dual significance as both a mechanistic driver of vascular injury and a clinically relevant biomarker [32]. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, persistent MMP-9 activity induces low-grade BBB leakage, facilitating accumulation of inflammatory mediators and neurotoxic proteins that exacerbate neuronal damage and accelerate disease progression [33]. Importantly, experimental inhibition of MMP-9\u2014through tetracyclines, statins, or genetic deletion\u2014reduces BBB permeability, limits cerebral edema, and improves survival in animal models, emphasizing its therapeutic relevance. However, because transient BBB permeability may also facilitate immunosurveillance and repair, state-specific modulation rather than non-selective inhibition of MMP-9 is increasingly recognized as the most promising therapeutic approach [34,35].\n\n## 1.7. MMP-9 in Tumor Progression and Metastasis\nMMP-9 has been extensively studied in oncology, representing one of the most comprehensively investigated areas of its biology. MMP-9 promotes cancer progression through basement-membrane degradation, induction of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, and growth-factor-driven angiogenesis, collectively enabling invasion, dissemination, and metastatic expansion. Experimental models consistently show that MMP-9 overexpression accelerates tumor progression, whereas genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition suppresses invasion and reduces metastatic burden [36]. Clinically, elevated MMP-9 levels, whether in tumor tissue or circulation, correlate with poor prognosis, increased metastatic potential, and therapeutic resistance across malignancies including breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers [37]. Because MMP-9 activity integrates ECM remodeling, growth-factor activation, and immune modulation, its role in malignancy is inherently multifaceted and disease-specific. This functional complexity underlies why MMP-9 remains a compelling yet technically challenging therapeutic target in cancer biology [37,38].\n\n## 1.8. MMP-9 in Fibrosis and Chronic Inflammation\nFibrosis and chronic inflammation exemplify disease momentum in which sustained MMP-9 activity transitions from adaptive to pathogenic. Under physiological conditions, MMP-9 facilitates matrix turnover during wound healing and resolution of acute injury [39]. Persistent upregulation, often driven by ongoing immune activation or oxidative/metabolic stress, disrupts the equilibrium between matrix degradation and deposition. In pulmonary fibrosis, elevated MMP-9 fosters aberrant fibroblast activation and disordered alveolar remodeling, correlating with disease progression and loss of lung function [40]. In rheumatoid arthritis, excessive MMP-9 released from synovial fibroblasts and infiltrating neutrophils accelerates cartilage erosion and promotes progressive joint destruction. Within the cardiovascular system, chronic MMP-9 activity compromises vascular integrity by weakening extracellular scaffolds and inducing fibro-inflammatory remodeling of vessel walls. This process increases atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and contributes to maladaptive left-ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction [41,42]. Moreover, in chronic disease states, MMP-9 generates bioactive ECM fragments\u2014matrikines\u2014that perpetuate inflammation and fibrosis through reciprocal immune activation. Whereas transient MMP-9 activity supports effective tissue repair, its persistent overexpression establishes a self-reinforcing cycle of inflammation and maladaptive remodeling that culminates in progressive organ dysfunction. This functional duality underscores the therapeutic potential of selective, state-specific modulation of MMP-9 aimed at suppressing chronic activity while preserving its reparative functions [2] (Figure 1).\n\n## 1.9. Additional Mechanistic Links to MMP-9 Function: PON1, Endothelial Function, and Hyperhomocysteinemia\nParaoxonase-1 (PON1), an HDL-bound lactonase with potent anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activity, acts upstream of signaling pathways that transcriptionally control MMP-9 [43]; when PON1 activity decreases (either due to HDL dysfunction during inflammation or reduced PON1 secretion), redox tone and pro-inflammatory signaling increase, enhancing NF-\u03baB/AP-1\u2013dependent MMP-9 transcription and tipping tissues toward matrix injury and barrier failure [44]. Mechanistically, recent reviews and experimental studies show that PON1 mitigates oxidized-lipid stress and suppresses innate immune activation in monocyte-macrophage and endothelial compartment-functions tightly linked to limiting NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity, the canonical drivers of the MMP-9 promoter. Thus, reduced PON1 is expected to de-inhibit MMP-9 expression and gelatinolysis in inflamed vascular beds and tissues. Consistent with this axis, human cohort data in untreated familial hypercholesterolemia demonstrate network correlations among PON1 arylesterase activity, MMP-9, and inflammatory mediators (sCD40L, S1P), positioning PON1 within an HDL-inflammation-protease module relevant to endothelial dysfunction. In parallel, disease pathologies characterized by mTOR-driven suppression of PON1 glycosylation/secretion show immune dysregulation that would be permissive for protease induction, reinforcing the plausibility that PON1 loss removes a brake on MMP-9-mediated ECM remodeling [45]. Finally, multiple recent studies confirm that NF-\u03baB/AP-1 signaling directly controls MMP-9 transcription under inflammatory stimuli (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, hyperglycemia), providing a clear mechanistic approach through which reduced PON1 activity can propagate to MMP-9 overexpression and disease progression [46,47,48]. Together, these lines of evidence support a model in which PON1 preserves HDL\u2019s anti-inflammatory competence and restrains MMP-9; when PON1 is low or dysfunctional, the ensuing oxidative/inflammatory milieu unlocks MMP-9 transcriptional programs, accelerating matrix degradation, barrier leak, and chronic tissue injury.\nMMP-9 links inflammatory signaling to endothelial dysfunction by targeting all three structural tiers that maintain barrier homeostasis, namely: glycocalyx, tight junctions, and basement membrane. At the luminal interface, MMP-9-mediated proteolysis accelerates endothelial glycocalyx degradation, impairing mechanosensory and anti-thromboinflammatory functions while exposing underlying adhesion molecules that promote leukocyte\u2013endothelial interactions; in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, circulating MMP-9 levels correlated with markers of glycocalyx degradation and organ injury, and mechanistic study identified MMP-9 as a mediator of eGLX shedding in vitro and in vivo [49]. At intercellular junctions, MMP-9 directly compromises tight-junction complexes (e.g., claudin-5, occludin, ZO-1), increasing paracellular permeability and promoting blood\u2013tissue barrier disruption; in the cerebral endothelium, VEGF-MMP-9 signaling compromises tight junctions and disrupts transport systems, and selective MMP-9 blockade attenuates blood\u2013brain barrier breakdown in stroke models [50]. At the abluminal surface, MMP-9 degrades basement-membrane scaffolds (collagen IV, laminin), debilitating endothelial anchorage and facilitating leukocyte diapedesis, edema, and capillary leak\u2014core features of endothelial dysfunction, which were summarized across recent reviews [51]. Clinically, symptoms associated with acute vascular stress show consistent MMP-9 and markers of barrier injury elevation: during cardiopulmonary bypass, perioperative peaks in serum MMP-9 paralleled shedding of glycocalyx components, implicating protease-driven barrier compromise [52]. Upstream, canonical inflammatory pathways (TNF-\u03b1, ROS, macrophage-derived mediators) induce MMP-9 via NF-\u03baB/AP-1 and related pathways, establishing a feed-forward loop in which proteolysis amplifies leukocyte recruitment and oxidative stress, further depressing nitric-oxide bioavailability and vascular reactivity\u2014a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction [53,54,55]. Together, these data position MMP-9 not as a bystander marker but as an executable node that integrates inflammatory activation with structural barrier impairment; then also rationalize therapeutic strategies that pair endothelial-protective agents with precise MMP-9 inhibition to restore vascular integrity in inflammatory and ischemic disease states.\nElevated homocysteine (Hcy) exerts a pro-inflammatory and pro-remodeling stimulus that converges on MMP-9 upregulation and activation, thereby bridging metabolic dysregulation and ECM perturbation in inflammatory disease states. Mechanistically, Hcy induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers a pertussis-toxin sensitive G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) cascade, initiating intracellular Ca2+ fluxes, protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation which then leads to phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 MAPK axis in endothelial and other vascular cells; this pathway culminates in enhanced MMP-9 transcription, zymogen activation and gelatinolytic activity [56,57]. Once released, MMP-9 degrades basement-membrane and interstitial ECM components, disrupts endothelial and epithelial barrier integrity (e.g., increased paracellular permeability), and liberates ECM-sequestered cytokines and chemokines, thereby amplifying leukocyte infiltration, vascular leak and chronic inflammatory signaling. In conditions of hyper-homocysteinaemia (HHcy), such as in diabetes, vascular disease or certain inflammatory disorders, Hcy-driven MMP-9 activity promotes a feed-forward loop: ECM disruption strengthens inflammatory cell activity, inflammation sustains Hcy-mediated cell stress and MMP-9 induction, and barrier damage accelerates organ dysfunction. For example, in retinal endothelial cells Hcy increased MMP-9 expression and permeability changes consistent with microvascular injury [58]. Although direct clinical cohort studies remain relatively limited, elevated serum Hcy correlates with higher MMP-9 levels in human inflammatory conditions (e.g., epilepsy, vascular aneurysm) suggesting translational relevance [59]. Taken together, this mechanistic axis of Hcy-ERK1/2/PKC-MMP-9-ECM barrier disruption offers a plausible biochemical pathway linking metabolic perturbation to matrix remodeling and inflammatory disease progression.\nIn summary, the biological impact of MMP-9 is profoundly state/tissue-dependent, differing sharply between acute and chronic settings. During acute injury or infection, transient MMP-9 release from neutrophils and macrophages facilitates leukocyte recruitment, pathogen clearance, and re-epithelialization, thereby accelerating tissue repair [60]. In wound healing, timely MMP-9 activity supports keratinocyte migration and angiogenic remodeling\u2014processes essential for restoration of barrier integrity. In contrast, persistent MMP-9 expression beyond the acute phase converts reparative proteolysis into pathology [61]. Chronic MMP-9 activity promotes aneurysm expansion by degrading elastin and weakening vascular walls, while in neurodegenerative diseases, sustained proteolysis disrupts the blood\u2013brain barrier and exacerbates neuronal injury. This dichotomy underscores the need for therapeutic strategies focused on temporal precision rather than non-selective inhibition.\nThe present review synthesizes current evidence on how clinically approved drugs and investigational agents modulate MMP-9 expression and activity, aiming to point out therapeutic opportunities for state-specific regulation across inflammatory, fibrotic, vascular, and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n## 2. Druggability and Translational Potential of MMP-9\nGiven its central role in coordinating inflammation and ECM remodeling, dysregulated MMP-9 activity directly contributes to tissue injury and disease progression, making it a rational and tractable therapeutic target. Because MMP-9 is secreted and functions in the extracellular milieu, it is inherently more \u201cdruggable\u201d than intracellular kinases or transcription factors. Its catalytic pocket and auxiliary domains are physically accessible to diverse therapeutic modalities\u2014including small-molecule zinc chelators, domain-selective inhibitors, engineered tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (MMPs), and monoclonal antibodies\u2014and its enzymatic activity can be monitored in biofluids such as plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to guide dosing and response. This extracellular localization also permits localized delivery (e.g., topical, inhaled, or intralesional), minimizing systemic exposure and off-target toxicities: a principle increasingly recognized across extracellular protease biology and reinforced for MMP-9 in recent translational analyses [62,63,64]. Elevated MMP-9 concentrations in circulation or within diseased tissues consistently correlate with greater disease severity, poorer prognosis, and adverse clinical outcomes, reinforcing its dual value as both a biomarker and a therapeutic anchor. Collectively, these correlations provide clinical validation that MMP-9 modulation is not only mechanistically plausible but also poised to exert tangible impact on disease trajectories [65,66].\n\n## 2.1. Lessons from Broad-Spectrum Metalloproteinase Inhibition\nBuilding on this rationale, early therapeutic programs aimed to directly suppress MMP-9 catalytic activity through broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibition\u2014an approach that showed preclinical promise but ultimately proved very limited in the clinic. First-generation hydroxamate inhibitors, including batimastat (BB-94) and marimastat (BB-2516), advanced to Phase II/III oncology trials and exploratory studies in arthritis but yielded minimal survival or clinical benefit [67]. Their development was further devastated by a dose-limiting musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS) characterized by arthralgia, myalgia, stiffness, tendinopathy, and contracture, typically emerging after 1 to 3 months of therapy and resolving upon dose reduction or discontinuation. Randomized trials of marimastat in pancreatic cancer failed to demonstrate efficacy versus gemcitabine, alone or in combination, while frequently reporting MSS-related adverse events. Subsequent analyses implicated on-target and off-target inhibition of multiple MMP isoforms as the principal cause of these toxicities and the broader clinical failure of non-selective agents. These experiences catalyzed a paradigm shift toward isoform- and domain-selective MMP inhibition strategies designed to preserve efficacy while improving tolerability [68,69].\n\n## 2.2. Toward Selectivity and Temporal Precision\nMMP-9 is not uniformly deleterious. As stated before, during acute injury and early repair, regulated gelatinase activity supports ECM remodeling, angiogenesis, leukocyte trafficking, and re-epithelialization. Broad or prolonged inhibition at these stages can disrupt normal healing and worsen outcomes. This context dependence, reiterated in recent wound-healing and inflammatory-disease literature, underscores that effective interventions must be phase-specific: for example, transient suppression during chronic overexpression or pathologic remodeling, but not during early reparative windows [70,71]. Foundational clinical pharmacology revealed key developability gaps. Batimastat exhibited poor oral bioavailability and solubility, necessitating parenteral administration with local tolerability issues. Marimastat, while orally available, demonstrated variable systemic exposure and dose-limiting musculoskeletal toxicity, constraining efficacious dosing in oncology and arthritis trials. Together, these pharmacokinetic and toxicity liabilities narrowed the therapeutic index and yielded neutral or unfavorable risk\u2013benefit outcomes [72].\nIn sub-summary, the triad of non-selective target engagement, biological phase mismatch with MMP-9 reparative roles, and suboptimal pharmacokinetic/toxicity profiles explains the underperformance of early broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitors. These insights redirected the field toward precision inhibition: emphasizing isoform and domain selectivity, exosite binding, and antibody or TIMP-mimetic designs, coupled with case-dependent dosing and improved deliverability (local, topical, inhaled, or depot formulations) to restrain pathological MMP-9 activity while preserving its physiological functions.\n\n## MMP-9 as a Target for Precision Modulation\nGiven the clinical limitations of broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibition, current strategies increasingly focus on indirect modulation of MMP-9 through repurposed or pleiotropic agents that attenuate its expression or activity without abolishing physiological signaling. Compounds such as statins, tetracyclines (e.g., sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs; e.g., losartan), macrolides (e.g., azithromycin or clarithromycin), glucocorticoids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, and select polyphenols converge on upstream regulatory nodes\u2014including NF-\u03baB, AP-1, MAPK/ERK, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, and oxidative-stress signaling\u2014to suppress MMP-9 transcription, limit neutrophil degranulation, enhance tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase expression, and reduce protease release from macrophages and endothelial cells. This signal-specific attenuation preserves MMP-9 transient, reparative roles in early injury while dampening the chronic proteolytic tone that drives vascular leak, barrier failure, and maladaptive remodeling. From a translational standpoint, these agents offer favorable safety profiles, oral bioavailability, and dosing flexibility, enabling phase-specific and combination approaches: for example, pairing anti-inflammatory pathway control with domain-selective MMP-9 inhibition to enhance therapeutic precision and expand the druggable landscape [73,74].\nThis emerging therapeutic paradigm reframes MMP-9 not as a target to silence, but as one to recalibrate. The prevailing consensus emphasizes context-specific, partial modulation\u2014suppressing the chronic, tissue-damaging proteolytic tone while preserving the transient physiological functions required for repair, angiogenesis, and immune resolution. This precision-inhibition concept has redirected drug-development efforts toward agents that precisely adjust MMP-9 indirectly, acting through upstream regulatory pathways rather than direct catalytic blockade. Within this framework, repurposed pharmacologic classes, including statins, tetracyclines, ARBs, and macrolides, have gained renewed interest for their capacity to attenuate MMP-9 expression or release in disease-specific conditions while maintaining favorable safety margins. The following sections summarize how these agent classes achieve such modulation, detailing their mechanistic pathways, supporting evidence, and therapeutic implications across vascular, inflammatory, and fibrotic pathologies.\n\n## 4.1. Statins: Indirect Modulators of MMP-9 via Mevalonate Pathway Interference\nBeyond their canonical lipid-lowering activity via inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, statins (e.g., atorvastatin, simva",
