  "abstract": "At present, anti-virulence drugs are being considered as potential therapeutic alternatives and/or adjuvants to currently failing antibiotics. These drugs do not kill bacteria but inhibit virulence factors essential for establishing infection and pathogenesis through targeting non-essential metabolic pathways reducing the selective pressure to develop resistance. We investigated the effect of naturally isolated plant compounds on the repression of the quorum sensing (QS) system which is linked to virulence/pathogenicity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results show that trans-cinnamaldehyde (CA) and salicylic acid (SA) significantly inhibit expression of QS regulatory and virulence genes in P. aeruginosa PAO1 at sub-inhibitory levels without any bactericidal effect. CA effectively downregulated both the las and rhl QS systems with lasI and lasR levels inhibited by 13- and 7-fold respectively compared to 3- and 2-fold reductions with SA treatment, during the stationary growth phase. The QS inhibitors (QSI) also reduced the production of extracellular virulence factors with CA reducing protease, elastase and pyocyanin by 65%, 22% and 32%, respectively. The QSIs significantly reduced biofilm formation and concomitantly with repressed rhamnolipid gene expression, only trace amount of extracellular rhamnolipids were detected. The QSIs did not completely inhibit virulence factor expression and production but their administration significantly lowered the virulence phenotypes at both the transcriptional and extracellular levels. This study shows the significant inhibitory effect of natural plant-derived compounds on the repression of QS systems in P. aeruginosa.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nA review commissioned by the UK government in 2014 (https://amr-review.org/) predicted that there will be more deaths in the world due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) than cancer by the year 2050. Antibiotic usage creates an evolutionary stress response in the bacterial population that over time leads to the emergence of resistant strains. Extensive use of antibiotics coupled with the diminished pipeline of new antibiotics has seen a rapid evolution of resistance that has culminated in the development of multi-drug-resistant pathogens that are extremely difficult to treat.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, is prevalent in immunocompromised patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These bacteria are notorious biofilm producers. The biofilm provides a stratified environment with the core being more anoxic with low bacterial growth and metabolic rates. These metabolically inactive biofilm cells are resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (Anwar and Costerton 1990; Werner et al. 2004) ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and tobramycin (Brown et al. 1988). The biofilm layer also acts as a diffusion barrier reducing the rate of antibiotic penetration, preventing sufficient accumulation of antibiotics and allowing time for expression of resistance genes (Jefferson et al. 2005). In CF, P. aeruginosa forms biofilms and readily adapts to the lung environment eventually leading to prolonged inflammation and chronic lung infections that are very difficult to treat using conventional antibiotic methods. In addition, the presence of inducible (MexXY) and constitutive (MexAB-OprM) efflux pumps and the poor permeability of the outer membrane also contribute to the reduced susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to a broad range of antibiotics (Aghazadeh et al. 2014, L\u00f3pez-Causap\u00e9 et al. 2017). Effective treatment of P. aeruginosa is therefore becoming increasingly challenging with the bacterium showing resistance to even the third and the fourth generations of carbapenems and cephalosporins (Luna et al. 2013; Patel et al. 2014). Therefore, it has become critical to find alternative therapies to successfully clear P. aeruginosa infections.\nP. aeruginosa produces a variety of virulence factors, in a coordinated system, that are reported to enable host colonisation and adaptation (Valderrey et al. 2010; Gellatly and Hancock 2013; Sousa and Pereira 2014). These virulence factors include the production of biofilm, pyocyanin, elastase and rhamnolipid and are under the control of a cell density-dependent signalling regulation known as quorum sensing (QS) (Stover et al. 2000; Lee and Zhang 2014; Sousa and Pereira 2014) The canonical QS system in P. aeruginosa includes the las and the rhl systems both consisting of LuxI type synthases (LasI and RhlI) which produce specific acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). At sufficiently high bacterial concentrations, these AHL molecules then bind to the LuxR type receptors (LasR and RhlR) to form transcriptional activation complexes which regulate the transcription of various genes involved with virulence of P. aeruginosa (Papenfort and Bassler 2016).\nInterfering with this QS system through application of QS inhibitors (QSI) is a novel therapeutic target that has shown to effectively reduce virulence in opportunistic pathogens. The disruption of QS communication can be achieved through the enzymatic degradation of AHL molecules by lactonases, acylases and oxidoreductases or by using small structural molecules that inhibit the QS signal molecule from binding to its cognate regulatory protein (Morohoshi et al. 2009; Kalia 2013; Kisch et al. 2014; Gupta et al. 2015). A synthetic derivative of a furanone, compound C30 (C30F), has been shown to supress bacterial QS in mice lung models through interference with AHL production (Wu et al. 2004) and through attenuation of QS-regulated production of virulence factors (Hentzer et al. 2003). In the recent past, a range of plant compounds have shown to be effective as anti-QS and anti-biofilm agents (Musthafa et al. 2010; Jayelakshmi et al. 2016; Ouyang et al. 2016; Luo et al. 2017). Kim et al. (2015), using an in silico approach, predicted that natural gingerol could bind to the QS regulator LasR protein. They then demonstrated, using standard assays, a decrease in production of several virulence factors and biofilm formation following exposure to gingerol, consistent with interference of the binding of the cognate signal molecule, 3-oxo-C12-HSL, to LasR. Moreover, access to crystal structure of LasI (Gould et al. 2004) and LasR (Bottomley et al. 2007) along with the availability of computer-aided programs like structure-based virtual screening (SB-VS) and molecular docking have been useful in identifying more compounds with potential anti-QS abilities.\nA SB-VS experiment unlocked six drugs with LasR structural similarity including salicylic acid (SA), nifuroxazide and chlorzoxazone (Yang et al. 2009). These compounds were able to significantly inhibit QS gene expression and phenotypes in P. aeruginosa. In another study, molecular docking results showed that a plant compound, trans-cinnamaldehyde (CA), was able to interact with the LasI substrate binding sites by forming hydrophobic and \u03c0-\u03c0 bonds with phenylalanine-27 and 105, tryptophan-33 and a hydrogen bond with arginine-30 in the LasI synthase (Chang et al. 2014). Since QS is related to several virulence mechanisms in P. aeruginosa, therefore the ability of compounds like SA and CA to interfere with the QS system can open the possibility of utilising these as effective anti-QS agents for controlling the pathogenic phenotypes of P. aeruginosa.\nThe QS system allows bacteria to adapt to changing environmental conditions at the population level, with the adaptation mediated at the transcriptional level via regulated expression of the QS genes in response to metabolic and environmental stimuli (Wagner et al. 2003; Scott and Hwa 2011). Understanding the transcriptional expression of the QS genes is therefore essential for understanding the physiology of the cell under QS inhibitory conditions. The current information on the ability of CA and SA to reduce QS activity in P. aeruginosa is very limited and has been mostly acquired through crude estimations of virulence proteins or by using high throughput microarray analysis for identifying changes to gene expression (Prithiviraj et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2009). Therefore, in this study, we have used a very robust and MIQE (minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments) compliant reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay, a gold standard for low-medium throughput quantitative expression analysis, to study the changes in transcriptomic profiles when P. aeruginosa is subjected to CA and SA treatments at sub-inhibitory concentrations. To correlate the effects of the gene expression on the phenotypic profiles following QSI treatment, the QS-regulated virulence factors rhamnolipid, elastase, protease and pyocyanin were estimated.\n\n## Bacterial strains and media\nThe fully sequenced and widely reported laboratory strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 (ATCC 15692) was used in the study. Overnight cultures were prepared from \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C frozen culture stocks in a nutrient-rich LB broth at 37\u00a0\u00b0C under shaking conditions at 180\u00a0rpm. This culture was subsequently used to inoculate proteose-peptone-glucose-ammonium-salts (PPGAS) medium (Zhang and Miller 1992). The bacteria were cultivated in PPGAS medium at 1/5th MIC levels of 2.27\u00a0mM CA and 3.62\u00a0mM SA in either single or combination treatments. A positive control for QS was included using 10\u00a0\u03bcM C30F (Skindersoe et al. 2008). All experiments were carried out in biological triplicates. The experimental compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, UK, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Minimum inhibitory concentration determination\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the test inhibitors against P. aeruginosa PAO1 was determined using the resazurin microtiter plate assay (Elshikh et al. 2016) which used the redox indicator resazurin that changed colour from blue to pink in the presence of viable cells. The MIC was determined as the concentration at which there was no colour change following 4\u00a0h incubation of the overnight cells with 0.015% resazurin.\n\n## RNA isolation and purity assessment\nThe cell pellets were collected from different growth phase cultures by spinning them at 13,000\u00d7g for 2\u20133\u00a0min at room temperature and the RNA extracted using JetGene RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were lysed with occasional vortexing in a buffer solution with 1\u00d7 TE buffer, 15\u00a0mg/ml lysozyme and 20\u00a0mg/ml proteinase K (Promega). The samples were then transferred to a 2-ml Lysing Matrix A tube (MP Biomedicals) with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol containing RLT buffer (provided in the kit) for enhanced lysis. The contents in the lysing matrix tubes were then homogenised using the FastPrep\u2122 FP 200 cell disrupter at speed 5.5 for 30\u00a0s. A double DNA-digestion treatment was done to ensure that the RNA was free of any genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination. The RNA isolated was quantified using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer with A260/A280 ratio of 1.8\u20132.1 being considered as pure. The integrity of the samples was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis for presence of two sharp distinct bands representing 23S and 16S rRNA. The integrity was further verified by analysing the samples in an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer where RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values greater than 8 were observed for all samples. The RIN is based on a numbering system from 1 to 10 with 1 being the most degraded and 10 being the most intact. The RNA samples were aliquoted and stored at \u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n## Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction\nFirst-strand cDNA was synthesised using Superscript\u2122 Reverse Transcriptase II (Invitrogen). Each reaction mix contained DNase-treated RNA (500\u00a0ng), 20\u2013250\u00a0ng random primers (Promega), 10\u00a0mM dNTPs and RNase free water to make to the reaction volume 15.6\u00a0\u03bcl. The reactions were heated at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min before adding 5\u00d7 strand buffer, 0.1\u00a0M DTT and RNase inhibitor (RNAse out\u2122 Invitrogen) in final concentrations of 1\u00d7, 10\u00a0\u03bcM and 40\u00a0units, respectively. The reactions were incubated at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0min before adding Superscript\u2122 II Reverse Transcriptase (200\u00a0units final concentration) (Invitrogen). The RT reactions were carried out at a series of temperature starting with 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min, 42\u00a0\u00b0C for 50\u00a0min and 70\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min. The first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed for all the biological triplicates from each time point. A negative reaction without reverse transcriptase was included in every run. All cDNA samples were stored at \u2212\u200920\u00a0\u00b0C prior to use.\nThe cDNA synthesised was then used as a template for real-time PCR amplification using the ROCHE LightCycler LC480 system with a SYBR-Green probe. Since PCR efficiency is highly dependent on primer specificity, therefore a qPCR calibration curve was generated from each primer set using PAO1 gDNA. Only those primers which gave a calibration curve with a slope value between \u2212\u20093.1 and \u2212\u20093.6 that translated into amplification efficiencies of 90\u2013110% were used for PCR quantification. The binding specificity of these primers were also validated post-amplification by generating a melt curve for each primer set with the presence of a single sharp peak eliminating the chances of any non-specific binding.\nThe qPCR 10\u00a0\u03bcl reaction mix each contained 2\u00d7 SYBR Green master mix (1\u00d7), forward and reverse primers (1\u00a0\u03bcM), cDNA template and molecular grade water. Negative controls in form of \u2013RT (no reverse transcriptase) and no template control NTC (no DNA template added) were included to rule out any contamination during the preparation process. A positive control in the form of gDNA was also included. The cut-off values for residual gDNA amplification and NTC were set at greater than 35 and 40\u00a0cycles, respectively. The cycling parameters were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min, 40\u201350\u00a0cycles of denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s, annealing at 59\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s, extension at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0s.\n\n## Reference gene validation\nA total of six candidate genes (gyrB, proC, cysG, rpoD, rpoB and 16S) were analysed under inhibitory conditions to assess for the most stable and reliable reference genes for this study. The stability of the six candidate genes were validated under inhibitory conditions using three independent software packages geNorm (Vandesompele et al. 2002), NormFinder (Andersen et al. 2004) and BestKeeper (Pfaffl et al. 2004). The geNorm algorithm measures the stability of the genes based on pairwise variation between one candidate gene and the other genes and was calculated using the online available tool RefFinder (Fu et al. 2013). The NormFinder model considers the intra- and inter-group variation to calculate the stability of the genes using a R-based software excel package (MOMA, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark). The BestKeeper is a free excel-based tool that correlated the coefficient of the candidate gene with a BestKeeper Index to generate the most stable gene. The genes rpoD and proC were identified as most stable for use as reference genes in this study by the three algorithms.\n\n## Relative gene expression data analysis\nSystem (LC480 software, version 2)-generated analysis was performed on the real-time PCR data. The threshold values (Cq) from each of the qPCR run were extracted from the LC480 system using the second derivative maximum method (Rasmussen 2001). Data analysis was performed by taking the arithmetic mean of the Cq values of the technical replicates and transferring it into log values to generate the relative quantities (RQ). The RQ values of the target genes were then divided by geometric mean of reference gene RQs (rpoD and proC) to give normalised relative quantity value (NRQ). The NRQ value was then divided by the experimental calibration which in the experiment was relative expression at early log (6-h) and was set to 1. The output was the calibration normalised ratio (CNRQ) which was used in extrapolating information on the expression profile of the target genes.\n\n## Production of virulence factors\nAn overnight PAO1 culture was used to inoculate PPGAS medium and incubated for 24\u00a0h under continuous shaking at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected, and filter sterilised for use in the following assays:\n\n## Protease\nThe amount of LasA protease produced by PAO1 following incubation with and without the inhibitors were estimated by adding 0.1\u00a0ml culture supernatant to a reaction mixture containing 0.8% azocasein in 500\u00a0\u03bcl of 50\u00a0mM K2HPO4 (pH\u00a07) and incubating at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.5\u00a0ml of 1.5\u00a0M HCl and then keeping it on ice for 30\u00a0min. The precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (10,000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min). NaOH (1\u00a0N) was added to the supernatant in equal ratios and the concentration of acid soluble azopeptides measured spectrophotometrically at 440\u00a0nm.\n\n## Elastase\nThe LasB elastase production was measured by adding 1\u00a0ml of the culture supernatant to a 2-ml reaction buffer (100\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, 1\u00a0mM CaCl2) containing the substrate elastin-Congo red and incubating for 3\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with shaking at 180\u00a0rpm. The reaction was terminated by adding 2\u00a0ml of 0.7\u00a0M sodium phosphate buffer (pH\u00a06) and placing it on ice for 15\u00a0min. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 495\u00a0nm.\n\n## Pyocyanin\nThe pyocyanin concentration was estimated by adding 7.5\u00a0ml filtered supernatant to 4.5\u00a0ml of chloroform and vortexed until the colour changed to greenish blue. The samples were centrifuged (10,000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min) and 3\u00a0ml of the resulting blue coloured liquid was transferred to a new tube containing 1.5\u00a0ml of 0.2\u00a0M HCl and shaken until the blue colour turned to pink. The pink layer was transferred to a cuvette and the absorbance measured at 520\u00a0nm. The concentration was calculated in \u03bcg/ml by multiplying the absorbance by factor 17.072 (Essar et al. 1990).\n\n## Rhamnolipid extraction and purification\nThe extraction of rhamnolipid was performed following the method of Smyth et al. (2010). The culture supernatant (50\u00a0ml) from PAO1 grown in PPGAS medium for 24\u00a0h was acidified to pH\u00a02 and extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The organic solvent containing rhamnolipid was dried with anhydrous MgSO4 to remove residual water. Rhamnolipid was isolated from the ethyl acetate solvent in the form of yellow gummy residue after removing the organic solvent in a rotary evaporator. The rhamnolipid crude extract was then purified using solid phase extraction by running the samples through Strata SI-1 Silica (55\u00a0\u03bcM, 70A) Giga tubes (Phenomenex). After conditioning and removing the impurities from the column with chloroform, rhamnolipids were eluted using chloroform and methanol in ratios of 5:0.3, 5:0.5 and 1:1.\n\n## Rhamnolipid separation and analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry\nAnalysis of the extracted rhamnolipid mixture was performed using a LCQ\u2122 quadrupole ion trap with a negative electrospray ionisation (ESI) interface connected to a Thermo HPLC Spectra system. A reverse phase C18 column with 5\u00a0\u03bcm particles was used to separate the rhamnolipids. The parameters included desolvation gas at 65\u00a0units and source temperature 250\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0\u03bcl injection volume and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl/min flow rate. Two mobile phases were used: HPLC grade water (A) and acetonitrile (B). The rhamnolipid congeners were resolved in a linear gradient mobile phase starting with 70%A:30%B to 30%A:70%B over 50\u00a0min and then back to 70%A:30%B for 55\u00a0min with a final hold of 5\u00a0min. Tandem mass spectrometry was carried out using ESI in a negative mode using collision-induced dissociation (CID) at 35% peak within the MS range of 50\u2013800\u00a0m/z.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nAll statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad prism v5.\n\n## Growth phase-dependent expression of QS genes\nThe effect of the QSIs on the QS system of the fully sequenced laboratory strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Stover et al. 2000) was investigated by studying the transcriptional expression of the QS synthase and regulatory genes. Both lasR/lasI and rhlR/rhlI systems were expressed in a cell density-dependent manner with expression levels increasing upon entering the stationary phases of growth (Fig.\u00a01b). Maximum expression levels for all genes were detected in the mid-late stationary phase corresponding with highest cell density. In both las and rhl systems, the autoinducer synthase genes (lasI and rhlI) were expressed earlier and at much higher relative concentrations in comparison to their cognate regulatory protein genes (lasR and rhlR). At high concentrations, LasR and RhlR bind to their cognate N-acyl homoserine autoinducer molecules; the bound complex is then a transcriptional regulator of several genes in P. aeruginosa.Fig. 1Las and rhl QS regulatory genes in P. aeruginosa PAO1 are differentially expressed in a cell density-dependent manner. a Growth of P. aeruginosa in phosphate-limited media (PPGAS). b Transcriptional expression of QS regulatory genes lasR, lasI, rhlR and rhlI. Expression levels were quantified by RT-qPCR, relative mRNA levels for target genes were normalised to the geometric mean of two reference genes (rpoD and proC) and values plotted are the mean calibrator normalised ratios to log phase (6\u00a0h). Vertical bars represent S.D. \u00b1 (n\u2009=\u20093). Data was analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test (**p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001)\nThe QS system regulates productions of most of the P. aeruginosa virulence factors including the low molecular weight glycolipids rhamnolipids that are under the direct regulation of the RhlR-RhlI system. The rhamnolipid biosynthetic genes display a differential expression profile where rhlA and rhlB are expressed earlier relative to rhlC, which is only maximally expressed after significant rhlAB expression (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013c). The products of rhlAB are responsible for the first step in rhamnolipid biosynthesis, which produce mono-rhamnolipids. Mono-rhamnolipids are in turn the substrate for the rhlC gene product to produce di-rhamnolipids. The differential sequential expression pattern observed for the rhamnosyltransferases from this data is suggestive of a coordinated regulation based on the substrate availability.Fig. 2QS-regulated virulence-associated genes are highly expressed in stationary phase in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Relative transcript levels of virulence-associated rhamnolipid biosynthetic genes arhlA,brhlB, crhlC and exoprotease dlasA and elastase elasB. Relative mRNA levels for target genes were normalised to the geometric mean of two reference genes (rpoD and proC) and values plotted are the mean calibrator normalised ratios to log phase (6\u00a0h). Vertical bars represent S.D. \u00b1 (n\u2009=\u20093). Data was analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test (*p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001)\nThe other virulence-associated genes responsible for the production of the exoprotease LasA, and elastase LasB, were also transcriptionally expressed in a cell density-dependent manner with maximum expression observed in mid-late stationary phase (Fig.\u00a02d\u2013e). The las-regulated virulence genes lasA and lasB were shown to be significantly upregulated during the mid-late stationary phase with expression levels >\u2009300-fold relative to log phase levels (p\u2009<\u20090.001).\n\n## Quorum sensing inhibitors effectively downregulate the QS regulatory system\nSelectively interfering with QS systems is a novel strategy targeted at disarming virulent opportunistic pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. In Gram-negative bacteria, QS is typically mediated by acyl-HSLs and rational analogues have been designed to specifically target these systems. Several phenolic compounds have been be shown to effectively disrupt QS systems in Gram-negative bacteria (Hossain et al. 2017). In this part of the study, we investigated the anti-QS abilities of naturally isolated plant compounds CA, SA and a synthetic furanone compound, C30F, reported to attenuate virulence in P. aeruginosa (Fig.\u00a03a) (Hentzer et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2009; Chang et al. 2014). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the test compounds CA and SA was determined as 11.35\u00a0mM and 18.1\u00a0mM, respectively. The use of the quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) at the sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/5th MIC) did not affect the growth phenotype of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (Fig.\u00a03b). CA treatment resulted in a longer lag phase but reached similar optical densities to untreated PAO1 within 6\u00a0h of incubation. Since QS genes were significantly expressed in the stationary phase (Fig.\u00a01b), we tested the effect of the QSIs on the expression of QS-associated regulatory and virulence genes during mid to late stationary phase of growth, when the cell density was at its highest.Fig. 3Quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) significantly reduce expression of las and rhl QS systems in P. aeruginosa. a Molecular structure of the natural QSIs used in this study, salicylic acid (SA), trans-cinnamaldehyde (CA) and positive control furanone C30 (C30F). b Growth of P. aeruginosa with QSIs at sub-MIC concentrations (SA 3.62\u00a0mM, CA 2.27\u00a0mM and C30F 10\u00a0\u03bcM). c Relative expression of QS regulatory genes lasR, lasI, rhlR and rhlI with combinations of QSI treatments. Relative mRNA levels for target genes were normalised to the geometric mean of two reference genes (rpoD and proC). Vertical bars represent S.D. \u00b1 (n\u2009=\u20093). Data was analysed using two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-tests (**p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001)\nCA at sub-inhibitory levels (2.27\u00a0mM) significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) reduced the expression of the QS transcriptional regulatory genes lasR and rhlR (Fig.\u00a03c). CA caused a 7-fold reduction (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in lasR gene expression while the difference between the untreated and treated cells was even higher in the LasR-controlled rhlR expression with a reduction of 19-fold being observed. CA also effected a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) reduction in the AHL synthase gene expressions during the stationary phase of growth. The downregulation in the rhlI synthase gene following treatment was 6-fold while in lasI synthase, it was 13-fold during the late stationary phase.\nThe second inhibitor tested was the plant hormonal compound SA at sub-inhibitory concentration of 3.62\u00a0mM. This also caused inhibition in QS gene expressions but unlike CA, the overall reductions were lower (Fig.\u00a03c). The compound seemed to have a greater inhibitory effect on the las QS circuit unlike CA which effectively repressed both las and rhl QS synthase and regulatory genes. The downregulation in QS transcriptional regulatory genes lasR and rhlR due to SA treatment was 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively. The transcript levels of the lasI synthase gene were three times lower following SA treatment, while there was no significant reduction in expression of the rhlI synthase gene in the stationary phase. The behaviour of the lasR and rhlR regulatory genes determines the expression of virulence-related genes associated with the QS mechanisms in P. aeruginosa; therefore, these results suggest that SA would not produce a very high downregulation in QS-regulated virulence gene expressions in comparison to CA.\nAlthough CA and SA when used alone did show reduction in most QS gene transcripts but when used in combination (PAO1 + CA + SA) the results were inconclusive (Fig.\u00a03c). The combination treatment influenced the lasI synthase expression where it reduced the transcript level by 5-fold. A similar reduction (3-fold) was also observed in the transcriptional regulator rhlR expression. However, the combination treatment did not exert any significant effect on the expression levels of the lasR and rhlI genes. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of CA and SA on the QS gene transcriptions were compromised when used in combination.\nThe positive control C30F produced an expected inhibitory effect on the rhl circuit of P. aeruginosa during the mid-late stationary phase when used at a concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a03c). The rhlR transcript level was reduced 5-fold while the synthase gene rhlI was repressed by 2-fold. The compound did not produce any significant inhibition on the transcription levels of the lasRI genes.\n\n## Trans-cinnamaldehyde significantly reduces expression of QS-regulated virulence factors\nAfter investigating the effect of the experimental inhibitors on the QS master genes\u2014lasRI and rhlRI, the study focused on investigating the inhibitory effects on the las and rhl QS-regulated set of virulence genes. The target genes selected were las-controlled lasA protease and lasB elastase and rhl-regulated genes rhlA, rhlB and rhlC associated with rhamnolipid production (Fig.\u00a04a). The target gene expression was normalised using validated reference genes, rpoD and proC, across all culture conditions.Fig. 4Trans-cinnamaldehyde (CA) significantly reduces gene expression of virulence-associated genes in P. aeruginosa PAO1. a The schematic representation of the genetic location of las and rhl QS systems in P. aeruginosa.

Gene expression was quantified at 24\u00a0h for both treated and untreated cells, relative mRNA levels for target genes were normalised to the geometric mean of two reference genes (rpoD and proC). Vertical bars represent S.D. \u00b1 (n\u2009=\u20093). Data was analysed using two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-tests (*p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, ***p\u2009<\u20090.001)\nThe significant inhibition in lasRI expressions in P. aeruginosa PAO1 when subjected to CA as seen before affected the mRNA transcript levels of the lasA and lasB genes (Fig.\u00a04b). The relative expression data showed a 19-fold (p\u2009<\u20090.001) reduction in lasA gene expression while lasB showed a 7-fold (p\u2009<\u20090.001) reduction when compared to the untreated cells during the mid-late stationary growth phase. The compound was also effective in highly repressing the expression of the rhamnolipid synthesis rhlABC genes during stationary phase (Fig.\u00a04b). The reduction in transcript level of rhlA was observed as greater than 100-fold (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A significantly high downregulation was also observed in rhlB (p\u2009<\u20090.05) expression while a 2-fold reduction (p\u2009<\u20090.05) was observed in rhlC expression.\nThe ability of SA to repress the las QS genes lasI and lasR (Fig.\u00a03c) consequently influenced the virulence gene expressions of lasA and lasB. The transcript levels of lasA and lasB were reduced by 4-fold (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and 2-fold (p\u2009<\u20090.01) respectively when treated with 3.62\u00a0mM SA (Fig.\u00a04c). It can be hypothesised that the inability of SA to produce an inhibitory effect on rhlI synthase gene expression (Fig.\u00a03c) meant there were enough signal molecules to drive the expression of the rhlABC genes. Although a 3-fold (p\u2009<\u20090.001) reduction was observed in rhlA gene expression, partly due to the reduced expression of the rhlR regulatory gene, the overall inhibitory effect seemed small as insignificant reductions in rhlB and rhlC gene expressions were observed with SA at the concentration tested in this experiment (Fig.\u00a04c).\nThe downregulation in the lasI synthase gene when treated with both 2.27\u00a0mM CA and 3.62\u00a0mM SA did not correlate in a mRNA reduction of the las-regulated virulence genes lasA and lasB (Fig.\u00a04d). However, the ability of the combination treatment to repress the QS regulatory rhlR gene caused a significant downregulation (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in the rhlAB genes. The combination treatment exerted a 4-",
