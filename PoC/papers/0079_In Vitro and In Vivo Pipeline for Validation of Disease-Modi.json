  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) affects approximately 2.6 million people in Europe and the USA annually, resulting in chronic disabilities in more than 40% of TBI patients [1,2]. TBI triggers a cascade of parallel and sequential molecular changes in the injured brain that underlie the evolution of post-TBI secondary pathologies, including apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress [3,4]. Various approaches targeting different secondary pathologies have been tested in proof-of-concept preclinical trials, with over 100 demonstrating some positive effect on post-TBI outcome [5,6,7,8,9]. Translation of preclinical findings to the clinic has been inefficient, however and recovery-enhancing treatments for TBI are still lacking in clinical practice.\nThe majority of drug-discovery studies for TBI have used a hypothesis-driven \u201csingle target/single drug approach.\u201d Non-hypothesis driven in silico approaches, however, were recently demonstrated to present a viable strategy in drug discovery for complex brain diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy [10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. The in silico network approach applies molecular omics of tissue pathology in drug discovery, allowing for unbiased identification of pharmacotherapies that target more than one disease-activated molecular network [17,18,19,20,21]. These studies have screened large compound libraries, such as the Connectivity Map (CMap) and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) [11,22], to identify not only novel compounds but also compounds that can be repurposed to hasten clinical implementation.\nOur previous in silico studies revealed desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin, sirolimus and trimipramine as modulators of chronic post-TBI transcriptomics [22,23]. Using in silico analysis, however, it is difficult to determine whether the modulation of gene expression results in favourable or unfavourable cellular and functional outcomes. Therefore, we developed a stepwise in vitro and in vivo pipeline to systematically screen in silico-predicted TBI treatments using monitoring biomarkers for neuroinflammation, nitric oxide \u2013mediated neurotoxicity and neuronal survival. In vivo data were collected using common data elements and stored in a RedCAP database [24]. Based on go/no-go decisions at each step, the disease-modifying effects of clomipramine, which is rapidly metabolized to its active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, were tested in an in vivo proof-of-concept trial in a rat lateral fluid-percussion model of TBI. The data show the usefulness of the pipeline and emphasizes the need for systematic monitoring of both therapeutic effects and adverse events.\n\n## 2. Results\nThe screening pipeline is outlined in Figure 1.\nSelection of in silico discovered compounds to validation. Our earlier in silico analysis identified antidepressants, anti-cancer drugs and bioactive compounds as modifiers of post-TBI transcriptomics changes [22,23]. Four of these compounds were chosen for the present in vitro and in vivo validation based on their connectivity score in LINCS analysis effect on TBI-related gene networks and availability in the markets. LINCS connectivity score indicates the magnitude of alterations induced by the compound on post-TBI transcriptomics.\nDesmethylclomipramine, an active metabolite of antidepressant clomipramine antidepressant, up-regulates Nfe2l2, which promotes anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective proteins [25,26,27]. Ionomycin also upregulated Nfe2l2 [28]. Trimipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, modulates Tp73, a transcription factor regulating apoptotic functions [29,30,31]. Sirolimus improves functional recovery and attenuates epileptogenesis after TBI [9,32]. Moreover, desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin and sirolimus have a high LINCS connectivity score and are available on the market.\n\n## 2.1. In Silico Screening of Compounds that Modify TBI-Induced Gene Expression at Both Acute and Chronic Time Points\nTo predict the therapeutic time window of in vivo treatment, we assessed whether the compounds modifying TBI signature (TBI-sig) at 3 months post-TBI would also modify the TBI-sig at the earlier 32-h time-point. As summarized in Table 1, desmethylclomipramine and ionomycin had a positive concordance value with both the acute and chronic TBI-sig. Trimipramine had a positive concordance value with the acute but not with the chronic, TBI-sig. Sirolimus showed no concordance value with the acute TBI-sig and a negative concordance with the chronic TBI-sig.\n\n## 2.2. Desmethylclomipramine, Ionomycin, Trimipramine and Sirolimus Inhibit TNF\u03b1 and Nitrite Production in Cortical Neuron-BV2 Microglia Co-Culture\nOn the basis of the concordance value and its positivity/negativity alone, it is difficult to predict whether a compound will have favourable or unfavourable effects on post-TBI recovery. Therefore, we next investigated whether the four candidate treatments revealed by the iLINCS analysis exhibited anti-inflammatory (reduction in tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) production), anti-oxidant [reduction in nitrite (NO2\u2212) levels], and/or neuroprotective (neuronal cell survival) properties in in vitro neuronal-microglial co-cultures.\n\n## 2.2.1. TNF\u03b1 Secretion\nThe Mann-Whitney U-test revealed that a 48-h exposure of cell cultures to the treatments affected TNF\u03b1 concentrations in the cell culture media. The TNF\u03b1 concentration was decreased by desmethylclomipramine (1 \u00b5M: p = 4.45 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 8.25 \u00d7 10\u22124), ionomycin (1 \u00b5m: p = 2.71 \u00d7 10\u22126, 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 2.72 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 0.01 \u00b5M: p = 5.11 \u00d7 10\u22124), trimipramine (10 \u00b5M: p = 5.44 \u00d7 10\u22126, 1 \u00b5M: p = 5.17 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 4.60 \u00d7 10\u22123) and sirolimus (1 \u00b5M: p = 3.26 \u00d7 10\u22125, 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 5.17 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 0.01 \u00b5M: p = 5.11 \u00d7 10\u22124) compared with untreated controls (Figure 2A, Table S1). The effects of desmethylclomipramine and ionomycin were dose-dependent (0.1 \u00b5M being more effective than 0.01 \u00b5M in both, p < 0.05).\n\n## 2.2.2. Nitrite Levels\nThe Mann-Whitney U-test indicated that 48-h exposure of cell cultures to the treatments affected the nitrite (NO2\u2212) concentrations in the cell culture media. The nitrite concentration was decreased by desmethylclomipramine (1 \u00b5M: p = 5.95 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 2.64 \u00d7 10\u22123), ionomycin (1 \u00b5M: p = 6.76\u00d710\u22125, 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 1.60 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 0.01 \u00b5M: p = 5.12 \u00d7 10\u22124), trimipramine (10 \u00b5M: p = 4.70 \u00d7 10\u22125, 1 \u00b5M: p = 7.63 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 2.16 \u00d7 10\u22122) and sirolimus (1 \u00b5M: p = 1.59 \u00d7 10\u22127, 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 2.39 \u00d7 10\u22127 and 0.01 \u00b5M: p = 1.80 \u00d7 10\u22123 ) compared with untreated controls (Figure 2B, Table S1). The effects of desmethylclomipramine and sirolimus were dose-dependent (0.1 \u00b5M being more effective than 0.01 \u00b5M in both, p < 0.05).\n\n## 2.2.3. Neuronal Viability\nThe Mann-Whitney U-test revealed increased neuronal viability (p < 0.05) following treatment with sirolimus (1 \u00b5M: p = 4.46 \u00d7 10\u22124, 0.1 \u00b5M: p = 1.12 \u00d7 10\u22122) but desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin or trimipramine, compared with untreated controls (Figure 2C, Table S1).\nThese data showed that sirolimus had a favourable effect on all three outcome measures. Desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin and trimipramine reduced neuroinflammation and nitrite production but did not modify neuronal survival.\n\n## 2.3.1. Target Gene Expression after TBI In Vivo\nFirst, we verified that the TBI-sig genes predicted to be targeted by candidate treatments in silico were regulated by TBI in vivo with a focus on neuroinflammation (cytokines) and neurotoxicity (nitric oxide [NO] production). As summarized in Table 2, lateral fluid-percussion injury (FPI) induced an upregulation of the Nrf2 target genes Hmox1 and Nqo1 in the perilesional cortex at 32 h and at 3 months post-TBI. Gclm expression was upregulated only at 32 h and Nfe2l2 was upregulated only at 3 months post-TBI. Nitric oxide synthase gene Nos2 was downregulated at 32 h and upregulated at 3 months post-TBI.\nTo confirm the co-occurrence of neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation in vivo, we investigated the expression levels of the inflammatory genes in the same samples. Of 12 cytokines, 10 had altered gene expression in the perilesional cortex at 32 h post-TBI, including upregulation of Il1b and ll6 and downregulation of Il1a, Il2, Il4, Il5, Il10, Il12a, Il-13, Csf2 and Ifng. Expression of and Tnf was not altered. Three months post-TBI, none of the 12 cytokines showed altered gene expression in the perilesional cortex (Table 2). These data indicated that neurotoxicity and cytokine responses co-occurred during the acute phase. Note that the plasma levels of the corresponding proteins were investigated in the acute post-TBI phase in vivo as predictive biomarkers for a therapeutic response (see below).\nEffect of candidate treatments on target gene expression in BV2 microglia cultures under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions. We then assessed whether the candidate treatments modulated target gene expression under inflammatory (cf. acute TBI tissue) and non-inflammatory (cf. chronic TBI tissue) conditions in vitro. We were particularly interested in the expression of the Nfe2l2 transcription factor and its activation, which our previous in silico analysis predicted to be regulated by desmethylclomipramine and ionomycin [23] and which we validated in vivo (see Section 4.3). Moreover, increased expression or availability of Nrf2 is neuroprotective and improves post-injury recovery [33,34,35].\n\n## 2.3.2. Inflammatory Condition\nDesmethylclomipramine upregulated Nfe2l2 gene expression (p = 1.87 \u00d7 10\u22122) in BV2 microglial cultures under lipopolysaccharide/interferon gamma (LPS/IFN\u03b3)-induced inflammation (Table 3). It did not change the expression of the Nrf2 target genes, Gclm (p = 7.70 \u00d7 10\u22121), Nqo1 (p = 7.85 \u00d7 10\u22121) and Hmox1 (p = 6.64 \u00d7 10\u22121) (Table 3).\nIonomycin had no effect on Nfe2l2 (p = 7.87 \u00d7 10\u22121) or its target genes Gclm (p = 1.04 \u00d7 10\u22121 ) and Hmox1 (p = 1.54 \u00d7 10\u22121) under inflammatory conditions but upregulated Nqo1 (p = 8.72 \u00d7 10\u22123) (Table 3).\n\n## 2.3.3. Non-inflammatory Condition\nDesmethylclomipramine upregulated Nfe2l2 gene expression (p = 3.83 \u00d7 10\u22122) in BV2 microglial cultures under non-inflammatory conditions (Table 3). It did not change the expression of the Nfe2l2 target genes Gclm (p = 7.83 \u00d7 10\u22121), Hmox1 (p = 3.99 \u00d7 10\u22121) and Nqo1 (p = 1.09 \u00d7 10\u22121) (Table 3).\nIonomycin did not change expression of Nfe2l2 (p = 1.65 \u00d7 10\u22121), Gclm (p = 4.52 \u00d7 10\u22121), Hmox1 (p = 6.58 \u00d7 10\u22122) or Nqo1 (p = 8.88 \u00d7 10\u22122) (Table 3) under non-inflammatory conditions.\nTo summarize, desmethylclomipramine was selected for further testing as it exhibited both anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and regulated target gene expression in vitro. In particular, desmethylclomipramine also upregulated Nfe2l2 gene expression under inflammatory conditions. Moreover, clomipramine, which is rapidly metabolized to desmethylclomipramine, passes through the blood-brain barrier and is water soluble [36,37], allowing it to be chronically administered via osmotic mini-pumps to achieve stable therapeutic tissue levels.\n\n## 2.4. Scoring of Candidate Compounds to Proceed to In Vivo Proof-of-Concept Validation\nThe properties of the four candidate compounds were scored to make a Go/No-go decision to proceed to an in vivo proof-of-concept validation trial. The compound properties included in the scoring were (a) in silico-predicted therapeutic time window, (b) pharmacokinetics (blood brain barrier penetration and water solubility), (c) effect on monitoring biomarkers (anti-inflammatory, nitric oxide-mediated neurotoxicity and neuroprotective) in the co-culture and (d) target engagement under inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. Using this scoring system, desmethylclomipramine scored 1.775 points and ionomycin scored 0.2625 points (Table 4).\n\n## 2.5.1. Acute Mortality, Impact Pressure, Post-impact Apnoea and Acute Post-impact Seizure-like Behaviour\nThe acute (<48 h) post-TBI mortality was 13.3%. The impact pressure did not differ between the Vehicle-TBI (3.29 \u00b1 0.13 atm, range 3.08\u20133.48 atm) and Clomi-TBI (3.33 \u00b1 0.08 atm, range 3.21\u20133.50 atm) groups (p = 6.78 \u00d7 10\u22121). The duration of post-impact apnoea did not differ between the groups [22.7 \u00b1 10.3 s (range 15\u201345 s) versus 32.7 \u00b1 9.6 s (range 20\u201345 s), p = 2.08 \u00d7 10\u22121, respectively]. Also, duration of acute post-impact seizure-like behaviour was comparable [11 vs. 15.6 s, (range 11.0\u201340.0 s) versus 8.2 \u00b1 14.2 (range 0.0\u201335.0 s), p = 5.40 \u00d7 10\u22121].\n\n## 2.5.2. Pathological Outcome\nVisual analysis of thionin-stained sections revealed that the location of the cortical lesion was comparable between the Vehicle-TBI and Clomi-TBI groups. Moreover, in both groups the progression of lesion extent was largely variable (Figure S1).\n\n## 2.5.3. Composite Neuroscore\nThe linear mixed effect model indicated a significant main effect of treatment on the composite neuroscore (p = 5.40 \u00d7 10\u22123). Compared with the Vehicle-TBI group, the estimated effect of Clomi-TBI treatment on the neuroscore was \u22122.2 points (p = 5.40 \u00d7 10\u22123). Thus, performance in the neuroscore test was impaired in the Clomi-TBI group between 7\u201328 days post-TBI (Figure 3A).\n\n## 2.5.4. Beam-walking\nThe linear mixed effect model did not indicate any significant main effect on beam-walking (p = 4.27 \u00d7 10\u22121). Thus, clomipramine treatment did not affect performance in the beam-walking test after TBI (Figure 3B).\n\n## Morris Water-maze\nThe Cox proportional hazards model did not reveal any treatment effect on the latencies in the acquisition phase (p = 5.35 \u00d7 10\u22121), indicating that clomipramine treatment did not affect spatial learning (Table S2). The Kruskal-Wallis test detected no difference between the treatment groups in the probe trial latency at 3 days (p = 5.71 \u00d7 10\u22121) or 5 days (p = 2.50 \u00d7 10\u22121), indicating that clomipramine did not affect spatial memory. Swimming speed did not differ between the Vehicle-TBI and Clomi-TBI groups (p > 0.05).\n\n## 2.7.1. Body Weight\nThe linear mixed effects model indicated a significant interaction between body weight and duration of clomipramine treatment (p = 3.12 \u00d7 10\u22126) compared with the Vehicle-TBI group. Model estimate of clomipramine treatment on body weight was \u22125.1 g at 6 days (p = 2.77 \u00d7 10\u22123), \u22127.9 g at 7 days (p = 2.10 \u00d7 10\u22124), \u221210.8 g at 9 days (p = 3.00 \u00d7 10\u22125), \u221216.5 g at 11 days (p = 1.50 \u00d7 10\u22127) and \u221215.5 g at 14 days after TBI (p = 4.82 \u00d7 10\u22126), indicating reduced post-TBI weight gain (Figure 3C). During the post-treatment period, model estimates of the clomipramine effect were non-significant (17 days; p = 9.74 \u00d7 10\u22122, 21 days; p = 1.40 \u00d7 10\u22121), indicating that the body weight of Clomi-TBI animals caught up to that of the Vehicle-TBI animals.\n\n## 2.7.2. Rectal Temperature\nThe linear mixed effects model revealed no treatment effect on rectal temperature (p = 2.73 \u00d7 10\u22121), indicating that clomipramine treatment did not affect rectal temperature compared with vehicle treatment (Figure 3D).\n\n## 2.7.3. General Health\nPearson\u2019s Chi-squared test detected no difference in the number of health problems (p > 0.05) between the Vehicle-TBI and Clomi-TBI groups during the treatment (3\u201314 days) or post-treatment (15\u201328 days) periods.\n\n## 2.8.1. Plasma Cytokine Response to Injury and Clomipramine\nThe linear mixed effects model revealed no overall treatment effect on any of the plasma cytokines analysed (GM-CSF, IFNy, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13 or TNF\u03b1), indicating that clomipramine treatment did not modify post-TBI cytokine plasma concentrations. A model analysing the association between the cytokine concentrations and post-TBI day indicated a significant time-dependent variation (p < 0.05) in IFNy, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13 and TNF\u03b1 concentrations. Model estimates indicated that the cytokine concentrations were elevated at 7 days and 14 days post-TBI compared with those at 28 days post-TBI in both the Vehicle-TBI and Clomi-TBI groups (Table S3).\nInterestingly, the more severe the impairment before drug initiation, that is, the lower the neuroscore at 2 days, the higher the cytokine levels at 7 days in the Vehicle-TBI group. No association was found between the neuroscore at 2 days and the cytokine levels at 7 days in the Clomi-TBI group. The effect was detected for all plasma cytokines measured. Moreover, the better the recovery, that is, the better the performance in the neuroscore and/or beam-walking tests at 7 d, the higher the cytokine levels at 14 and 28 days in the Clomi-TBI group (Table S4). Even though we found some correlations between the functional performance and plasma cytokine levels, there were no group differences in individual cytokines. Therefore, we next compared the plasma cytokine patterns between the treatment groups using machine learning.\n\n## 2.8.2. Machine Learning Separated Clomipramine- and Saline-treated Animals at 28 days post-TBI\nFurther analysis applying machine learning (ML), using gradient boosted trees as a classifier, differentiated the Vehicle-TBI and Clomi-TBI groups by all cytokines at 28 days post-TBI (AUC 0.79) (Figure 4A,C). The mean concentration of all cytokines was higher in the Clomi-TBI group than in the Vehicle-TBI group (Figure 4A, Table S3), indicating that clomipramine delayed the decline of plasma cytokine levels. As found above using a linear mixed model, ML did not separate the Vehicle-TBI and Clomi-TBI groups based on plasma cytokine levels at 7 days (AUC 0.39) or 14 days (AUC 0.62) post-TBI.\nML analysis separated the Vehicle-TBI and Clomi-TBI groups by all features (AUC 0.81) (Figure 4B), indicating a clomipramine treatment effect on the outcome measures. As found above using the linear mixed model, ML analysis separated the Vehicle-TBI and Clomi-TBI groups by body weight (AUC 0.80) (Figure 4C).\n\n## 3. Discussion\nOur previous in silico analysis predicted desmethylclomipramine, ionomycin, trimipramine and sirolimus (rapamycin) as candidate treatments for modulation of post-TBI gene expression based on their interaction with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant gene networks [22,23]. However, the net effect of the compounds on post-injury functional outcome in vivo is difficult to predict based on in silico analysis only. Also, anticipation of adverse events based on in silico data is a challenge. Adverse events can, however, negligible effect on the overall outcome both in animal models and humans. Therefore, our objective was to develop a pipeline for validation of in silico predictions in vitro and assessment of their favourable as well as unfavourable disease-modifying effects on post-TBI outcome in an in vivo proof-of-concept preclinical trial.\n\n## 3.1. In Silico Analysis Predicted a Wide Therapeutic Time-Window for Desmethylclomipramine and Ionomycin\nWe first explored the time window of transcriptomics regulation for each of the four candidate compounds. iLINCS analysis revealed that desmethylclomipramine modulated TBI-induced gene expression at both 32 h and 3 months post-TBI, suggesting a wide therapeutic time-window. There are no prior predictions on the functional effects of transcriptomics regulation by desmethylclomipramine. Our literature review, however, suggested that transcriptomics regulation by desmethylclomipramine could be beneficial, as the effect of its parent drug clomipramine on gene expression in MCF7 cultures was comparable to that of compound F05, which promoted axonal regeneration in a rat optic nerve crush model [38,39].\nOf the other three compounds, ionomycin also modulated TBI-induced gene expression at both the 32-h and 3-month time-points, trimipramine had an acute effect and sirolimus demonstrated an effect at only the chronic time-point. We found no prior in silico studies on target gene networks for ionomycin or trimipramine. Also, in silico analyses of sirolimus-induced transcriptomics changes in neuronal tissues are sparse. One study using Connectivity Map (CMap) analysis reported a connection between the transcriptomic profile of sirolimus and \u201cpro-oligodendrogenic,\u201d predicting an effect on gene networks promoting oligodendrogenesis [40].\nIn conclusion, in silico analysis suggested that desmethylclomipramine and ionomycin would modulate TBI-induced transcriptomics changes at both acute and chronic post-TBI time periods. The little information available on the functional consequences of the transcriptomics modulation suggested a favourable outcome.\n\n## 3.2. In Vitro Analysis Revealed that Desmethylclomipramine, Ionomycin, Trimipramine and Sirolimus Reduce Neuroinflammation and Nitric Oxide\u2014Mediated Neurotoxicity\nBased on in silico analysis only, it is difficult to predict whether the positive or negative concordance score revealed by the iLINCS analysis is associated with positive or negative effects on post-TBI secondary pathologies. Therefore, we performed an in vitro analysis to assess the treatment effects on neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, which are the major components of post-TBI secondary tissue damage [4]. As monitoring biomarkers, we used TNF\u03b1 for neuroinflammation, nitrite for nitric oxide \u2013mediated neurotoxicity and MAP2 for neurodegeneration in neuron-BV2 microglia co-cultures stressed by LPS/IFN\u03b3-induced inflammation [41].\nDesmethylclomipramine reduced TNF\u03b1 levels by 12%\u201326%, an effect that was dose-dependent at 0.01\u20130.1 \u03bcM concentrations. It also reduced NO2\u2212 levels by 27% at 0.1\u20131 \u03bcM concentrations. Neuronal viability, however, was not affected. In a PubMed search, we were unable to identify any prior studies investigating the biologic effects of desmethylclomipramine in neuronal cell culture models. Clomipramine, the parent drug of desmethylclomipramine, however, reportedly decreased TNF\u03b1 and nitric oxide production at 10\u201320 \u00b5M concentrations in LPS-activated mouse BV2-microglia culture [42]. Clomipramine also showed a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect on FeSO4-mediated neurotoxicity in human primary neuronal cultures at concentrations from 0.1\u201310 \u00b5M [43]. It also improved neuronal viability in LPS-activated mouse BV2-microglia cultures at concentrations of 10\u201320 \u00b5M [42]. Taken together, at concentrations comparable to those of therapeutic antidepressant plasma, both clomipramine (rat 0.1\u20130.5 \u00b5M; human 0.3\u20131.1 \u00b5M) and desmethylclomipramine (rat 0.16\u20131.3 \u00b5M; human 0.2\u20131.8 \u00b5M) reduced neuroinflammation, nitrite formation and neurodegeneration in cell culture models [37,44,45,46,47].\nIonomycin dose-dependently reduced TNF\u03b1 levels by 29%\u201344% at concentrations of 0.01\u20131 \u00b5M. It also reduced NO2\u2212 levels by 17% at concentrations of 0.01\u20131 \u00b5M. Neuronal viability, however, was not affected in vitro in neuron BV2-microglia co-culture. Hutter-Paier et al. (2000) [48] reported reduced neuronal viability of primary cortical neurons isolated from chick embryos at ionomycin concentrations comparable to those used in our study, suggesting a cell-type specificity of the effect. Ionomycin has not been administered in vivo and thus there is no information on its blood-brain barrier permeability or therapeutic concentrations.\nTrimipramine reduced TNF\u03b1 production by 30% and NO2\u2212 by 15% at concentrations of 0.1\u201310 \u00b5M, which are comparable to its therapeutic antidepressant plasma concentration in humans (0.2\u20130.6 \u00b5M; Regenthal et al., 1999) [49]. Like desmethylclomipramine and ionomycin, trimipramine did not affect neuronal viability in the co-culture model. Trimipramine at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M was found to reduce iron neurotoxicity in human primary neuronal cultures [43].\nSirolimus reduced TNF\u03b1 levels by 39% at concentrations of 0.01\u20131 \u00b5M. It also reduced NO2\u2212 levels by 10%\u201322% and the effect was dose-dependent at concentrations of 0.01\u20130.1 \u03bcM. Interestingly, sirolimus counteracted the increased nitric oxide production in rat primary microglia culture at concentrations of 0.5\u20135 nM when inflammation was activated by a mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) [50]. No effect was detected at the concentrations used in the present study (0.1\u20131.0 nM) [50]. Unlike other compounds tested, sirolimus increased neuronal viability by 35%\u201347% at concentrations of 0.1\u20131 \u00b5M. Consistent with the anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective effects detected in vitro, intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg sirolimus at 4 h after weight-drop\u2013induced TBI in mice was neuroprotective and reduced the inflammatory response and microglia activation when assessed at 3 days post-injury [9]. Interestingly, the immunosuppressive plasma concentrations of sirolimus (0.01\u20130.2 \u00b5M) used to prevent rejection of organ transplants in pre-clinical and clinical studies correspond to those used in the present and previous in vitro studies [51].\nTaken together, all four compounds exhibited favourable in vitro effects on neuroinflammation and nitrite formation. In addition, sirolimus was neuroprotective.\n\n## 3.3. Target Expression and Target Engagement\nNext, we analysed the in vivo cortical post-TBI transcriptomics data at 32 h and 3 months to pinpoint gene expression changes that could be used as indicators of target gene engagement by test treatments. Positive concordance scores in our previous in silico and gene network analyses predicted that both desmethylclomipramine and ionomycin (but not trimipramine or sirolimus) would upregulate the expression of Nfe2l2 [23], suggesting a mechanistic role for the Nrf2 transcription factor in their treatment effects. The present transcriptomics analysis showed a 51% chronic upregulation of Nfe2l2 in the perilesional cortex after TBI. Importantly, Nrf2 promotes the expression of genes encoding anti-oxidant proteins [52], particularly Hmox1 and Nqo1, which were acutely upregulated after TBI by 726% and 134% and chronically upregulated by 227% and 156%, respectively. Further, it is well known that activation or increased levels of Nrf2 favourably modify post-injury tissue pathology and functional recovery in brain injury models, including chemoconvulsant-induced status epilepticus [33,34,53], TBI [54,55] and stroke [56,57,58]. Therefore, we selected Nfe2l2 and Nrf2 target genes as indicators of target engagement for desmethylclomipramine and ionomycin treatments in vitro.\nIn vitro analysis of target engagement indicated that desmethylclomipramine indeed upregulated Nfe2l2 gene expression by 115%\u2013121% already after 16-h incubation in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. Although desmethylclomipramine did not regulate the expression of Nrf2 target genes, we would expect the desmethylclomipramine-induced augmented Nfe2l2 expression to have favourable in vivo effects.\nWe found no major ionomycin effect of target gene expression in a 16-h incubation paradigm.\nTaken together, compared with ionomycin, desmethylclomipramine showed target engagement under both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.\n\n## 3.4. Go/No-Go Analysis for Selection of a Compound for In Vivo Testing\nSelection of the compound for the in vivo phase was based on weighted scoring, taking into account: (a) in silico-predicted wide therapeutic time window; and (b) pharmacokinetic properties of the compound, particularly the blood-brain barrier penetration and water solubility of the compound, enabling subcutaneous minipump administration to achieve stable plasma/brain concentrations; (c) anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and neuroprotective properties; and (d) target gene network engagement. Higher the score, better the expected in vivo performance. Of the four test compounds, desmethylclomipramine had the highest score. Depression is a common co-morbidity after TBI and is treated with antidepressants, including tricyclic antidepressants such as clomipramine [59,60]. To date, however, almost no data is available on the disease-modifying effects of post-TBI antidepressant treatments.\nDesmethylclomipramine is an active metabolite of the antidepressant clomipramine in rodents and primates and crosses the blood-brain barrier [37,45,46]. It is water soluble and its therapeutic plasma and brain concentrations are established [36,37,46]. Data on its adverse events are also reported [61]. Importantly, these adverse events do not include effects on blood pressure or intracerebral pressure, which would be detrimental considering future clinical use. Our in silico analysis predicted a wide therapeutic window for desmethylclomipramine. In vitro analysis indicated a reduction in neuroinflammation and nitric oxide \u2013mediated neurotoxicity. Upregulation of Nfe2l2 in inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions indicated target gene network engagement. Importantly, Nfe2l2 encodes the Nrf2 transcription factor and its activation or upregulation has favourable effects on different types of brain injuries; therefore, it could favourably modify post-TBI outcome [54,55,57,58].\nIonomycin was excluded from further in vivo validation as it did not show regulation of Nfe2l2 in the target engagement analysis. Some previous data, however, suggested that it reduced neuronal survival in some cell culture models [48] and its pharmacokinetics and blood-brain barrier permeability are unknown. It is soluble in chloroform and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (10 mg/mL), which limits its administration via osmotic minipump. Trimipramine and sirolimus were withdrawn from the in vivo phase due to the narrow therapeutic time window for their effect on post-TBI gene expression predicted by in silico analysis.\n\n## 3.5. In Vivo Assessment Failed to Demonstrate Favorable Disease-Modifying Effects of Clomipramine on TBI Functional Outcome and Plasma Cytokines\nTo assess the post-TBI therapeutic properties of clomipramine, we induced lateral FPI in rats and initiated clomipramine treatment via subcutaneous minipumps to ensure a stable therapeutic concentration. As expected, clomipramine slowed down the post-injury weight gain of the TBI animals, which is a well-kn",
