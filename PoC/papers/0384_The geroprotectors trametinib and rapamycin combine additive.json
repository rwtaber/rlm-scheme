We show here that trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes and that its combination with rapamycin was additive.

  "full_text": "## Main\nThe insulin\u2013IGF\u2013mTORC1\u2013Ras nutrient-sensing network is highly conserved in evolution and is implicated in the etiology of many age-related diseases1,2. Genetic inhibition of multiple nodes within the network can improve health during aging and extend lifespan in laboratory model organisms3. Growing evidence indicates a pro-aging role of the network in humans1,4. There is, therefore, potential to repurpose existing drugs with targets in this signaling network as geroprotectors to improve human health during aging5.\nInhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin (sirolimus), a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug used mainly for immunosuppression after organ transplantation6, robustly extends lifespan in multiple model organisms7,8, including mice, where rapamycin administration later in life at 600\u2009days of age increases median and maximal lifespan in both sexes9. Rapamycin also ameliorates aging-related morbidities, including cardiac dysfunction10 and impaired immune responses11. Administration of mTOR inhibitors to older human subjects led to enhanced immune response to influenza vaccine and reduced infection rate, with briefer and lower dosing than used clinically and minimal side effects12. Some of the geroprotective effects of rapamycin may, therefore, be conserved in humans.\nReduced signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) node of the nutrient-sensing network can extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila13,14 and has been viewed as the primary route mediating the anti-aging effects of reduced upstream insulin/IGF signaling. However, Ras signaling plays a role in aging in yeast15, whereas, in Drosophila, the Ras\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway is as important a mediator as the PI3K pathway of the upstream effects of insulin/IGF signaling on lifespan16. Indirect inhibition of Ras in mice is associated with increased lifespan and enhanced motor function in old age17. Inhibition of the Ras pathway may, therefore, have an evolutionarily conserved, geroprotective effect.\nRas hyperactivation is highly oncogenic, with a third of human cancers presenting with a Ras mutation12. There has, therefore, been an intense search for small-molecule inhibitors of the Ras pathway. Trametinib (also known as Mekinist), an FDA-approved drug for treatment of melanomas, is a highly specific inhibitor of MEKs18. Oral administration of trametinib increases Drosophila lifespan, even when started later in life16. To examine whether the geroprotective effect of trametinib is conserved in mice, we orally dosed female and male mice and assessed their aging phenotypes.\nThere is extensive crosstalk among the branches of the insulin\u2013IGF\u2013mTORC1\u2013Ras network. Simultaneous inhibition of different nodes within the network, by combined drug treatments, could, therefore, be more effective than suppression of single nodes, by prevention of compensatory responses. Combinatorial drug treatments could also inhibit specific targets more strongly or induce a wider range of protective effects, because different nodes in the network have many non-overlapping targets. Indeed, joint inhibition of mTOR, MEK and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) by rapamycin, trametinib and lithium, respectively, resulted in additive increases in Drosophila lifespan, both with both double and triple treatment combinations, the latter inducing a 48% median lifespan extension19. Such combinatorial drug treatment could exert similar benefits in mammalian aging.\nIn the present study, we investigated whether administration of trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend lifespan and improve health at old age in mice. We orally treated male and female mice with trametinib or rapamycin or with both drugs at the same doses as in the single-drug treatments. We assessed their survival, fitness, brain metabolism and organismal health. Administration of trametinib or rapamycin alone significantly increased male and female lifespan, whereas the combination produced an additive increase in both sexes. Additionally, combined treatment significantly reduced liver tumors in both sexes and spleen tumors in male mice and alleviated the age-related increased glucose uptake in the brain. Combination treatment also markedly reduced age-related inflammation in brain, kidney, spleen and muscle, with reduced levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib also is, thus, geroprotective in mice, and its combination with rapamycin is even more so.\n\n## Dose range for oral administration of trametinib in mice\nTo determine the dose range of trametinib that efficiently inhibited Ras/Mek/Erk signaling without adverse effects on health, young, C3B6F1 hybrid, wild-type male and female mice were fed with 0.29\u2009mg, 0.58\u2009mg, 1.44\u2009mg, 2.88\u2009mg or 11.52\u2009mg of trametinib per kg of diet for 4\u2009weeks (Fig. 1a), and their plasma levels of trametinib (Fig. 1b,c), Ras\u2013Mek\u2013Erk pathway activity (Fig. 1d,e), body weight (Fig. 1f,g) and spleen weight (Fig. 1h,i and Extended Data Fig. 1) were measured. Trametinib in plasma increased with dietary concentrations and was significantly higher in female mice than in male mice (Fig. 1b,c). Inhibition of MEK activity measured by western blot of liver samples using phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) as read-out (Fig. 1d,e) showed that Erk1/2 phosphorylation was unaffected at 0.29mg\u2009kg\u22121 and 0.58\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 trametinib and reduced at concentrations of 1.44\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 trametinib and higher in both sexes, although low sample number and high variability meant that only 11.52\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 in female mice resulted in a significant reduction. Decreased Ras\u2013Mek\u2013Erk pathway activity upon trametinib treatment was also observed in kidney, spleen and muscle tissue (Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c). pERK1/2 levels were significantly reduced in kidney and spleen tissue of female mice treated with 1.44\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 trametinib (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b) with a non-significant trend in female (Extended Data Fig. 1c) and male (Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c) muscle. Treatment with 11.52\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 trametinib strongly reduced pERK1/2 levels in all tested tissues in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c). Thus, short-term treatment with trametinib led to a dose-dependent downregulation of Ras\u2013Mek\u2013Erk pathway activity in several tissues. Trametinib did not significantly affect water uptake (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). Trametinib can cause body weight loss, liver lesions and necrosis and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels indicative of liver dysfunction. There was no significant effect of any dose of trametinib on plasma levels of AST (Extended Data Fig. 1f,g) or ALP (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i). At doses of 0.29\u20132.88\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, trametinib also did not affect body weight (Fig. 1f,g) or spleen size (Fig. 1h,i). In contrast, animals fed with 11.52\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 trametinib failed to gain body weight in the 4-week measurement period (Fig. 1f,g), with a trend for increased spleen weight in both sexes (Fig. 1h,i). In summary, dietary trametinib concentrations of 1.44\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 and higher were sufficient to inhibit Ras/Mek/Erk signaling, whereas only the highest dose of 11.52\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 trametinib induced adverse effects on mouse health. We, therefore, used 1.44\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 in all subsequent experiments.Fig. 1Doses of trametinib that inhibit Ras/MEK/Erk signaling in vivo in mice without detrimental side effects.a, Schematic outline of the trametinib pre-test experiment.

Trametinib treatment caused a significant lifespan extension in both sexes: in female mice with a median lifespan extension of 7.2% (P\u2009=\u20090.0248, log-rank test) (Fig. 2b) and no significant effect on maximum lifespan (P\u2009=\u20090.474, Wang\u2013Allison test) and in male mice with an increase in median lifespan of 10.2% (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, log-rank test) (Fig. 2c) and maximum lifespan of 15.8% (P\u2009=\u20090.014, Wang\u2013Allison test). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed no significant interaction between sex and trametinib treatment (P\u2009=\u20090.1793), showing that trametinib increased survival of male and female mice to a similar extent.Fig. 2Trametinib alone extends lifespan and acts additively with rapamycin to do so.a, Schematic overview of trametinib and rapamycin treatment. b,c, Survival of female (b) and male (c) mice. Trametinib significantly increased survival in both sexes. Combined treatment significantly increased lifespan compared to the individual drug treatments (log-rank test).

For survival data of the individual cohorts, see Extended Data Fig. 2a\u2013f. Lifespan studies of control and drug-treated animals were performed at the same time within the cohorts. M, months.Source data\nIn Drosophila, trametinib and rapamycin combine additively to extend lifespan19. We measured the survival of mice on diets containing only rapamycin (42\u2009mg\u2009kg\u20131), the dose so far inducing the largest increase in longevity20, or both rapamycin (42\u2009mg\u2009kg\u20131) and trametinib (1.44\u2009mg\u2009kg\u20131). Rapamycin was fed in alternate weeks (Fig. 2a), which improves metabolic health parameters11,21 and extends lifespan to a similar degree as continuous treatment22. As previously shown22, intermittent rapamycin treatment extended lifespan in both sexes to a similar extent (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, log-rank test; P\u2009=\u20090.2481 for the sex\u2013drug interaction, Cox proportional hazard) with an increase in median and maximum lifespan of 17.4% and 16.5%, respectively, in female mice (Fig. 2b) and 16.6% and 18.3%, respectively, in male mice (Fig. 2c). In contrast to the single treatments, combined treatment with rapamycin and trametinib increased survival more in female mice than in male mice (sex\u2013treatment interaction P\u2009=\u20090.0218, Cox proportional hazard) and caused a larger increase compared to the single treatment (Fig. 2b,c) in both sexes, with median and maximum lifespan increased by 34.9% and 32.4%, respectively, in female mice (Fig. 2b) and by 27.4% and 26.1%, respectively, in male mice (log-rank test; see Fig. 2b,c for the corresponding P values). In female mice, the hazard ratio of trametinib alone compared to control (P\u2009=\u20090.0383) was 0.6926 (0.4886\u20130.9804) and 0.4478 (0.3002\u20130.6641) in the presence of rapamycin (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Rapamycin alone had a hazard ratio of 0.3284 (0.2243\u20130.4784) compared to controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and 0.2123 (0.1380\u20130.3234) in the presence of trametinib (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). In male mice, trametinib alone had a hazard ratio of 0.5257 (0.3845\u20130.7169) versus controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and 0.5814 (0.4127\u20130.8154) in the presence of rapamycin (P\u2009=\u20090.0017). Rapamycin on its own had a hazard ratio of 0.4623 (0.3376\u20130.6316) compared to controls (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) and 0.5113 (0.3611\u20130.7208) in the presence of trametinib (P\u2009=\u20090.0001). There was, thus, no indication of a positive or negative interaction between drug treatments in either sex.\nIn summary, treating mice with either trametinib or rapamycin extended lifespan in both sexes, with lifespan further extended by combined treatment in an additive manner.\n\n## Effects of trametinib and rapamycin on mouse health\nWe measured health parameters, including body weight (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), heart function (Extended Data Fig. 3c\u2013f), anxiety behavior (Extended Data Fig. 3g\u2013j), endurance (Extended Data Fig. 3k,l), motor coordination (Extended Data Fig. 3m,n) and memory (Extended Data Fig. 3o,p), at middle age (12\u2009months) and old age (20\u201322\u2009months). In addition, we used metabolic cages to measure body weight (Extended Data Fig. 4a), fat and lean mass (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c), water and food uptake (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g) at 16\u2009months of age. Consistent with the pre-test, 1.44\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 trametinib had no effect on body weight (Extended Data Figs. 3a,b and 4a). In contrast, both rapamycin and combined drug treatment decreased body weight in female mice at 20\u2009months (Extended Data Figs. 3a and 4a) and in male mice at 12, 16 and 20\u2009months (Extended Data Figs. 3b and 4a). Combined treatment induced a significant increase in fat content (Extended Data Fig. 4b) and a decrease in lean mass (Extended Data Fig. 4c) in female mice but not male mice. Lean mass was lower in female mice treated with trametinib (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The drug treatments did not affect water or food uptake (Extended Data Fig. 4d,e). Heart rate of both sexes declined with age, and, in male mice, both rapamycin and trametinib attenuated the decline, with a similar non-significant trend in female mice (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). QT interval, a read-out for left ventricular hypertrophy, increased with age, and rapamycin decreased QT interval in female mice, and both rapamycin and combined treatment prevented the age-related increase in male mice (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). The drug treatments did not affect center occupancy in the open field (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h), forced running endurance on a treadmill (Extended Data Fig. 3k,l) or motor coordination in a rotarod assay (Extended Data Fig. 3m,n). Rapamycin-treated female mice performed slightly worse in the Y-maze (Extended Data Fig. 3o). Rapamycin-treated and combination-treated male mice showed increased global speed in the Y-maze (Extended Data Fig. 3p) with a similar trend for the combined drug treatment in the open field (Extended Data Fig. 3i), suggesting a higher motivation to move at old age. RER was not significantly altered by drug treatment in 16-month-old female mice (Extended Data Fig. 4f,g), whereas all three drug treatments significantly reduced RER during the night (Extended Data Fig. 4g), indicating a slight shift toward mixed carbohydrate and lipid utilization.\nChronic rapamycin treatment negatively affects glucose homeostasis and can lead to hyperglycemia. To assess the effect of trametinib, we measured glucose levels in plasma of 24-month-old animals. Both male and female mice treated with rapamycin showed significantly increased plasma glucose levels (Extended Data Fig. 4h). In contrast, plasma glucose levels of trametinib-treated animals did not differ significantly from controls (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Combination-treated mice had plasma glucose levels similar to rapamycin-treated animals, indicating that trametinib did not further exacerbate the effect of rapamycin. Thus, in contrast to rapamycin, trametinib extends lifespan without causing hyperglycemia. In human patients, trametinib treatment can result in increased plasma levels of ALT and ALP, indicative of reduced liver function. In contrast, treating mice chronically with 1.44\u2009mg of trametinib did not change plasma levels of AST and ALT in 24-month-old animals (Extended Data Fig. 4i), consistent with the results from young animals (Extended Data Fig. 1f\u2013i). Prolonged treatment with this dose of trametinib, therefore, did not affect liver function in mice.\nIn summary, rapamycin treatment alone or in combination with trametinib reduced body weight in both sexes and attenuated the decline in heart function with age. Both rapamycin and trametinib attenuated the age-related decline in heart rate in male mice; rapamycin decreased QT interval in both sexes; and combined treatment prevented the age-related increase in male mice. Rapamycin-treated and combination-treated female mice moved more at late age, and all drug treatments reduced nighttime RER in male mice. Rapamycin, but not trametinib, treatment caused hyperglycemia in old animals.\n\n## Combined drug treatment delays tumor growth\nTrametinib and rapamycin are cancer chemotherapeutics. To address whether their lifespan-extending effects were associated with their anti-cancer function, we performed a cross-sectional histopathological analysis at 24\u2009months of age, complemented by a macropathological assessment of overall tumor load postmortem, to assess any delay in tumor formation. Untreated mice predominantly developed tumors in the liver (Fig. 3a\u2013d), spleen (Fig. 3e\u2013h) and kidney (Fig. 3i,j). Liver tumors were most prevalent, with approximately 50% of female mice (Fig. 3a) and 70% of male mice (Fig. 3b) with tumors at 24\u2009months of age. No significant differences in liver tumors were detected with either trametinib or rapamycin treatment at 24\u2009months (Fig. 3a,b) or postmortem (Fig. 3c,d). However, combination treatment significantly reduced liver tumor numbers in both sexes at 24\u2009months of age (Fig. 3a,b) and in male mice postmortem (Fig. 3d), with a similar trend in female mice (Fig. 3c). Twenty-five percent of female mice and 20% of male mice had tumors in the spleen (Fig. 3e,f), and 15% of female mice and 5% of male mice showed kidney tumors (Fig. 3i,j) at 24\u2009months of age. Neither trametinib nor rapamycin reduced tumor formation in the spleen (Fig. 3e,f) or the kidney (Fig. 3i,j). The combination treatment significantly reduced spleen tumor formation at 24\u2009months of age in male mice (Fig. 3f), with a similar trend in female mice (Fig. 3e). Although we did not detect any tumors in the kidney upon combined treatment, this tumor type was so rare in controls that the effect was not significant. In summary, only the combination of rapamycin and trametinib caused significant effects on tumor load, and this was more obvious in the cross-sectional analysis\u2014for example, compare spleen pathology in male mice at 24\u2009months and postmortem (Fig. 3f versus Fig. 3g), which may indicate a delay in tumor formation rather than reduced overall lifetime tumor load. To further investigate, we performed a longitudinal analysis, measuring tumor formation in vivo by 18F fluodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) coupled with computed tomography (CT)23 in the same animals at 12, 18 and 24\u2009months of age (Fig. 3k). Because the capacity for the PET/CT measurement was limited, we restricted our analysis to control, trametinib-treated and combination-treated female mice. Tumors were identified as hypermetabolic regions, first in 24-month-old animals and then traced back in the same animals at 18\u2009months and 12\u2009months of age. Tumors were detected in several organs, including liver and uterus, but could only be reliably quantified in the spleen (Fig. 3g). Tumor occurrence increased with age in control animals, and, consistent with the histopathological analysis (Fig. 3e), trametinib did not affect spleen tumors at 12, 18 or 24\u2009months (Fig. 3k). In contrast, combination-treated animals showed lower spleen tumors at all three ages, with no significant increase with age. Combined drug treatment, thus, delayed tumor formation, but, due to the missing single rapamycin treatment, the effect may have been entirely attributable to rapamycin.Fig. 3Trametinib and rapamycin combined treatment delays tumor formation and overall tumor load.Cross-sectional histopathological analysis of tumor levels in liver (a,b), spleen (e,f) and kidney (i,j) samples of 24-month-old female mice (a,e,i) and male mice (b,f,j). Combined drug treatment significantly reduced liver tumors in both sexes at 24\u2009months and spleen tumors in male mice, with a similar trend for reduced tumor load in female spleen and male and female kidney (e,f). The absence of liver tumors was scored with 0, and the presence of low, moderate, high and very high severity tumors was scored with 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The absence or presence of spleen and kidney tumors was scored with 0 or 1, respectively. Liver tumor data for rapamycin and control animals were previously published22. Postmortem macropathology analysis of liver (c,d) and spleen (g,h) of animals from the lifespan and phenotyping cohort. k, Longitudinal analysis of spleen tumor progression via 18F-FDG PET/CT measurements in the same female animals at 12, 18 and 24\u2009months of age. Although tumor load increased from 12\u2009months to 24\u2009months in control and trametinib-treated mice, combination-treated animals showed no increase. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m. 18F-FDG uptake of rapamycin/trametinib versus control at 24\u2009months P\u2009=\u20090.08.

Numbers in brackets indicate the number of scored tissues per treatment.\n\n## Combined drug treatment attenuates age-related brain glucose uptake\nBrain glucose uptake increases during mouse aging24 and may be linked to impaired cognitive function25. We, therefore, used the 18F-FDG PET/CT longitudinal data to address whether trametinib and combined drug treatment attenuated age-related increase in glucose uptake (Fig. 4a\u2013g). 18F-FDG uptake increased with age in control female mice across the whole brain (Fig. 4a,e), consistent with a previous study24. 18F-FDG uptake increased significantly between 12\u2009months and 24\u2009months in the striatum and cerebellum but not the cortex (Fig. 4a,e). Uptake in trametinib-treated female mice showed a significant increase across the whole brain and in the striatum, cerebellum and cortex between 12\u2009months and 18\u2009months of age (Fig. 4b,f), with no further increase between 18\u2009months and 24\u2009months. Combined drug treatment prevented the age-related increase in glucose uptake both across the whole brain and in the striatum, cortex and cerebellum (Fig. 4c,g), confirmed by two-way ANOVA analysis (P\u2009<\u20090.05 interaction between age and drug treatment; Fig. 4d). Direct comparisons of uptake between 12\u2009months and 24\u2009months (Fig. 4f\u2013h) showed that trametinib treatment induced an intermediate phenotype between control and combination-treated animals with an increase in glucose uptake, whereas there was no change in the double drug-treated mice. Trametinib treatment, thus, ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake but only completely blocked it when combined with rapamycin.Fig. 4Combined treatment with trametinib and rapamycin counteracts the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake.Longitudinal 18F-FDG PET/CT measurements of age-related changes in differential glucose uptake in the female mouse brain. a\u2013c, Images show differential regional glucose uptake across the mouse brain between 24-month-old and 12-month-old control (a), trametinib-treated (b) and rapamcin/trametinib-treated (c) female mice. Color code represents the P value for the indicated voxels in a paired Student\u2019s t-test comparing 24-month-old to 12-month-old animals. Increase in glucose uptake is shown in red/yellow, decrease in blue color. d, Two-way ANOVA analysis highlights brain regions that showed a significant interaction between age and drug treatment in differential glucose uptake. A lighter green color indicates a higher significance in the two-way ANOVA analysis. e,f, Longitudional quantification of glucose uptake in whole brain, striatum, cerebellum and cortex at 12, 18 and 24\u2009months of age in control (e), trametinib-treated (f) and rapamycin/trametinib-treated (g) mice. Glucose uptake significantly increased with age in striatum and cerebellum of control animals but not in combination-treated animals. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m. h,i, Images show differential glucose uptake in the brain of 24-month-old trametinib versus control (h) and combination versus control (i) mice. j\u2013m, Quantification of differential glucose uptake between 12-month-old and 24-month-old whole brain (j), striatum (k), cerebellum (l) and cortex (m). Decrease in glucose uptake is indicated in blue color. Age-related differences in glucose uptake between 12\u2009months and 24\u2009months were significantly lower in combination-treated animals compared to controls. A similar but milder effect was also observed in trametinib-treated animals, which was only significant in the cerebellum. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test.

Microglia are the primary immune cells of the brain, and their increased activity is associated with age-related brain inflammation accompanied by synapse loss and late-onset neurodegeneration27. Microglia act in concert with astrocytes to resolve inflammation, and astrocyte-dependent Tgf\u03b2 secretion can inhibit microglia activation28. Aging disrupts this interplay, leading to exacerbated inflammation in both an autonomous and an astrocyte-dependent manner29. Because Ras/MEK/Erk signaling has been implicated in microglial activation27, we assessed whether drug treatment reduced activation of microglia and astrocyte density by performing immunohistological stainings of brain sections using antibodies against Iba-1 and Gfap for activated microglia and astrocyte density, respectively (Fig. 5a\u2013e), in brains of 24-month-old female control (Fig. 5b), rapamycin-treated (Fig. 5c), trametinib-treated (Fig. 5d) and rapamycin/trametinib-treated (Fig. 5e) mice. We also stained brains of 6-month-old control mice (Fig. 5a). Activated microglial and astrocyte density significantly increased in the striatum (Fig. 5f,g), hippocampus (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) and cortex (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d) but not the cerebellum (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f) of 24-month-old compared to 6-month-old controls, indicating increased brain inflammation at older age. Combined drug treatment significantly reduced the density of activated microglia and astrocytes in the striatum of 24-month-old mice (Fig. 5f,g), with a similar trend in the cortex (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d) but no significant effects in the hippocampus (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b) or the cerebellum (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f). Compared to the combined treatment, single treatment with rapamycin or trametinib did not significantly reduce the number of activated microglia in the striatum (Fig. 5f). Thus, rapamycin and trametinib had only mild effects, but the combination of both drugs significantly reduced age-related brain inflammation in specific regions. Notably, 18F-FDG uptake was increased in the cerebellum, suggesting mechanisms other than inflammation.Fig. 5Combination treatment attenuates age-related microglia activation and astrocyte density in the striatum.a\u2013e, Representative confocal composite images of immunohistochemical stainings of the striatum region in 6-month-old young controls (a) and 24-month-old controls (b) and 24-month-old rapamycin-treated (c), 24-month-old trametinib-treated (d) and 24-month-old rapamycin/trametinib-treated (e) female mice. Nuclei were stained with DAPI, astrocytes with GFAP and activated microglia with Iba-1. f,g, Quantification of microglia density (DAPI/Iba-1+ cells) (f) and astrocyte density (DAPI/GFAP+ cells) (g) per mouse striatum of young and old control animals and old drug-treated animals. Microglia and astrocyte density significantly increased with age in the striatum of control animals. Combination treatment significantly reduced microglia and astrocyte density in the striatum compared to old controls. One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test. 10\u201315 confocal images per brain region were averaged per sample. Numbers in brackets indicate the number of brain regions of individual animals analyzed per treatment. Data are presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009s.e.m.\nAs Ras/MEK/Erk signaling has been implicated in microglia activation27, we assessed whether trametinib crossed the blood\u2013brain barrier. Trametinib levels were measured in the brains of the animals used for the pre-test (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h). At dietary concentrations of 0.29\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121 and 0.58\u2009mg\u2009kg\u22121, trametinib was not detected in the brain (Extended Data Fig. 5g,h).
