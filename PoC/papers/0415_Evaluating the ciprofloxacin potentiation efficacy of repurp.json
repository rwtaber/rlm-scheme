  "title": "Evaluating the ciprofloxacin potentiation efficacy of repurposed drug flupentixol through efflux pump inhibition of pathogenic bacteria.",
  "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance concerning burdens is increasing day by day. Efflux pump upregulation is one of the mechanisms through which bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. To overcome this escalating problem in healthcare, repurposing existing drugs as efflux pump inhibitors in combination with antibiotics can help mitigate the growing resistance issue worldwide. In our study, we investigated the efflux pump inhibiting capability of the repurposed drug flupentixol in combination with different classes of antibiotics. In vitro combination susceptibility testing (disk diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration-MIC), in vivo shigellosis mouse model, and in silico study (molecular docking and simulation) were investigated. Ciprofloxacin-flupentixol yield promising in vitro results against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25,923, and Shigella boydii AL 17,313. The clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin-flupentixol was evaluated in the shigellosis mouse model. Clinical parameters, including percentage changes in body weight, total white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), were evaluated. In vivo findings supported the use of this combination in reducing the body's inflammatory state. Molecular docking and simulation study targeted the efflux pump proteins NorA (PDB ID: 7LO8), MexA Protein (PDB ID: 6IOK), and AcrB (PDB ID: 4CDI), to investigate the efflux pump inhibiting capability of flupentixol. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of the protein-flupentixol complex over 100 ns, supporting that flupentixol synergizes with ciprofloxacin by inhibiting the NorA efflux pump.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntimicrobial Resistance (AMR) has become a global nightmare in healthcare settings1. An estimated amount of 4\u00b795 million deaths was statistically reported to be linked with bacterial AMR in the year 2019, where 1\u00b727 million deaths were accounted for direct AMR. Each of the six multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli, was individually responsible for approximately 250,000 AMR-related deaths, collectively accounting for 929,000 of the 1.27 million total fatalities2. These pathogens, especially Gram-negative bacteria, exhibit resistance in part through overexpressed efflux pumps that actively extrude antibiotics3. Efflux pumps are bacterial membrane-bound proteins responsible for transporting toxins out of bacterial cells. Upregulation of these proteins leads to a multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial phenotype, as they extrude large amounts of antibiotics from different classes and also influence biofilm formation. Among the efflux pump superfamilies, the chromosomally encoded resistance nodulation division (RND) family is the most prevalent in Gram-negative bacteria and plays a direct role in MDR4\u20136. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has become a global burden, particularly in clinical settings such as intensive care units (ICUs), leading to increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs7.\nEfflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) offer a potential therapeutic strategy to restore the efficacy of obsolete antibiotics when used in combination. Although many EPIs have been identified, most have become clinically irrelevant due to off-target toxicity and unpredictable pharmacokinetic profiles8. Evaluating existing clinically approved drugs represents a potential strategy to overcome this issue. Since their pharmacokinetic profiles and toxicities are well characterized, these drugs can be directly assessed in preclinical and clinical studies with lower associated risks and costs9. Auranofin, a drug used for rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrated notable antimicrobial activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and exhibited additive effects when combined with existing antibiotics, along with strong post-antibiotic effects and the ability to reduce inflammatory cytokines10.\nOur research aims to identify a potential nonantibiotic that can act as an adjuvant by inhibiting the efflux pump, thereby enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics when administered in combination. The antipsychotic drug flupentixol contains antimicrobial activity and augments the activity of antibiotics11,12. We selected the antipsychotic drug flupentixol for in vitro, in vivo, and in silico studies to investigate its antimicrobial activity and efflux pump inhibiting capability, which could potentiate the efficacy of conventional antibiotics.\n\n## Chemicals\nAnalytical-grade reagents were acquired from Sigma Aldrich, USA. Antibiotics such as erythromycin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, penicillin, azithromycin, oxytetracycline, and non-antibiotic flupentixol were collected from Square Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Bangladesh. Gentamicin and chloramphenicol were collected from Incepta Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Bangladesh.\n\n## Bacterial strains\nThe experiment utilized three bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Shigella boydii AL 17313, all of which were obtained from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDRB).\n\n## Experimental animal\nFor shigellosis mouse model study, Swiss Albino mice weighing 25\u201330 g were collected from Jahangirnagar University, Savar, Dhaka. One week was allotted for the mice to adapt to the new environment. All the mice were kept in polypropylene cages at Animal House, Department of Pharmacy, University of Rajshahi. The house temperature was always controlled and kept at (24 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) with regular (12/12) light/dark cycle periods. Humidity was maintained between 60 and 70%. The mice were sacrificed in the current study by following13 in a two-step process as per the approved guideline. Initially, the mice were concentrated to unconscious through inhaled anesthetic agent (Isoflurane) exposure. Subsequently, they were killed by cervical dislocation while the animals were fully unconscious. Isoflurane was administrated by drop method in a container with a tightly fitted lid.\n\n## Ethical statement\nThe authors declare that all methods were conducted with relevant guidelines and regulations. The authors complied with the ARRIVE guidelines. The study was performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the Institutional Animal, Medical Ethics and Biosecurity Committee of the Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, which approved the experiment protocol (Memo No:09(17)/320/IAMEBBC/IBSc).\n\n## Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test\nBacteria were inoculated on Mueller-Hinton agar plates utilizing a previously cleaned and sterile cotton swab. Whatman filter paper disks (6 mm) were sterilized and infused with samples at a concentration of 20 \u00b5g/10\u00b5l and 20 \u00b5g/10\u00b5l/disk. After infusion, the disks were dried and placed on the agar plate. These Mueller\u2013Hinton agar plates were previously prepared and stored at 4 \u00b0C in sealed plastic bags to maintain sterility. Then, all the agar plates were placed inside an incubator for an incubation period of 24 h at 37 \u00b0C temperature. At last, the diameter of the transparent area around the disk was measured as a zone of inhibition14. The following procedure was performed three consecutive times to ensure the reproducibility of the findings.\n\n## Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)\nAs stated in CLSI guidelines, a standard broth microdilution method incorporating resazurin dye was performed to evaluate the visible growth of bacteria and determine the minimum inhibitory concentration. Each well in column 1 of the 96-well microtiter plate received 200 \u00b5l of sterile Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB), whereas columns 2\u201312 received 100 \u00b5l of MHB. Medications were dissolved in MHB, and a serial two-fold dilution was performed from column 1 to column 10 using a multichannel pipette. As a consequence, the concentration achieved for Oxytetracycline, with its combinations with flupentixol, ranged from 1024 to 2 \u00b5g/ml. Ciprofloxacin and its combination resulted in concentrations spanning from 64 to 0.03125 \u00b5g/ml, and so forth. Column 11 was used as a positive control to assess bacterial growth, and column 12 was used as a negative control to determine the sterility of the media. 50 \u00b5l of OD600 adjusted bacteria were added to each well except column 12. The 1:100 diluted inoculum achieved the final 5 \u00d7 105 CFU/ml concentration, prepared and distributed within 15 min. The 96-well microtiter plates were then incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. After the period, 50 \u00b5l Resazurin dye (0.015%) was further added to each well and again incubated for 2\u20134 h at 37 \u00b0C. The minimum inhibitory concentration is the lowest concentrated well, containing the unchanged blue resazurin15,16. The following procedure was performed three consecutive times to ensure the reproducibility of the findings.\n\n## In vivo test\nTo investigate the biological efficacy of the combination drug in a shigellosis model, Swiss Albino mice were taken and subdivided into four groups, as demonstrated in Table\u00a01. Each group contained four mice. They were kept acclimated for 1 week to adjust to the animal house environment. During this period, they were given a regular diet and drinking water. An overnight culture of S. boydii AL 17313 (4.8\u20135\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 CFU) in normal saline was used to infect the rodent groups except group 1. After a 3-day incubation period, Swiss Albino mice developed shigellosis. The mice received treatment for three consecutive days, on days 4, 5, and 6.\nTable 1Illustrates the treatment conditions (dose, and route of administration) that different mice groups received.Group no.Treatment methodGroup 1Control group (Normal saline treatment\u2009+\u2009regular diet) for 6 daysGroup 2Diseased group (S. boydii AL 17313 treated normal saline\u2009+\u2009regular diet) for 6 daysGroup 3Standard group: ciprofloxacin (40\u00a0mg/kg of bw)17 - intraperitoneal treatment for once a day\u2009+\u2009regular diet for 6 daysGroup 4Combination 1: ciprofloxacin (40\u00a0mg/kg of bw)\u2009+\u2009flupentixol (15\u00a0\u00b5g/kg of bw)18 - intraperitoneal treatment for once a day\u2009+\u2009regular diet for 6 days\n\n## Body weight monitoring\nBody weight changes of the Swiss Albino mice were measured using a 4-digit weighing machine on days 1, 3, and 7 before sacrifice. Body weight changes of the control group were compared with diseased group while body weight changes of the treatment groups were compared with standard group.\n\n## Hematological analysis\nThe protocol carried out for WBC counting and quantitative CRP measurement was performed by an automated veterinary hematology counter pocH-100iV Diff\u2122 (Sysmex\u00ae-Roche) and an ELISA from USCN (China) respectively specified in the protocols19,20.\n\n## ESR test\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test reflects the body\u2019s chronic inflammation and chronic infection. The modified Westergren method is used for determining ESR, where blood is anticoagulated with EDTA diluted in saline at a 4:1 ratio and then transferred to a colorless Westergren pipette scaled in millimeters. Then, they were mounted vertically in a rack and allowed to stand for 1 h. The sedimented value, measured in millimeters, is represented as the ESR value21.\n\n## Protein preparation and energy minimization\nThree efflux pump proteins named NorA (PDB ID: 7LO8) from S. aureus, MexA (PDB ID: 6IOK) from P. aeruginosa and AcrB (PDB ID: 4CDI) from E. coli that pumped out antimicrobial agents from bacteria and play a key role in antimicrobial resistance were selected from the Protein Data Bank22. The target proteins were prepared by Discovery Studio Visualizer v20.1.0.19.29.5 which involved removing hetero atoms, and other irrelevant substances. Energy minimization was performed by Swiss PDB viewer v4.1.0 using the GROMOS force field23. The ligand molecule flupentixol was retrieved from PubChem and selected as a ligand.\n\n## Molecular docking study\nMolecular docking studies were performed for three efflux pump proteins with flupentixol as a ligand. Blind rigid docking protocol with an exhaustiveness parameter of 8 was employed in this study. Protein molecules were loaded into PyRx software (v0.8) with Autodock Wizard24 and converted into macromolecules. Then, the ligand molecule was loaded and underwent energy minimization using the MMFF94 (Merck Molecular Force Field) method combined with the steepest descent algorithm, followed by converting them to PDBQT format. The specific grid box dimensions for each protein target were: for 7LO8, center: X = 138.0259, Y = 136.3518, Z = 156.998 and dimensions (\u00c5): X = 50.7636, Y = 53.9019, Z = 58.9182, for 6IOK, center: X = 176.0447, Y = 174.7145, Z = 82.7964 and dimensions (\u00c5): X = 77.6347, Y = 72.0862, Z = 135.7007 and for 4CDI, center: X = 13.5084, Y = 62.769, Z = 60.7602 and dimensions (\u00c5): X = 97.0252, Y = 63.2477, Z = 132.8974. Finally, the complexes with the lower RMSD and binding energy were considered for further analysis.\n\n## Molecular dynamics simulation\nMolecular dynamics simulations were run by YASARA dynamics software (v19.12.4), in which AMBER14 force field were utilized25. The complexes to be run underwent several preparatory procedures, such as eliminating artifacts, optimizing energy, and refining hydrogen bonds. The solvation process utilized a TIP3P water model (density: 0.997 g/L, at 25 \u00b0C and 1 atm) within a cubic simulation cell, under periodic boundary conditions that replicate physiological conditions, including a temperature of 310 K, pH 7.4, and a 0.9% NaCl concentration26. Initial energy minimization was achieved through simulated annealing, applying the steepest descent algorithm over 5000 iterations. Long-range electrostatic interactions were accurately calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm (cutoff radius: 8.0 \u00c5), and a time step of 1.25 fs was employed27. The trajectory data were recorded every 250 ps, and simulations were run for 100 ns under constant pressure conditions, controlled by the Berendsen thermostat28.\n\n## RMSD\nTo analyze the deviation of the structural component of the protein receptor complex, Root Mean Square Deviation is calculated. This process includes a relative change in the atomic positions compared with the reference standard by implementing the equation29.\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:RMSD\\:=\\:\\sqrt{\\left\\{\\frac{1}{N}{\\sum\\:}_{i=1}^{N}{\\left({r}_{i\\left(t\\right)}-{r}_{i\\left(0\\right)}\\right)}^{2}\\right\\}}$$\\end{document}\nWhere, N: Total number of atoms considered, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{r}_{i\\left(t\\right)}$$\\end{document}: Position of \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:i$$\\end{document}-th atom at time \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:t$$\\end{document}, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{r}_{i\\left(0\\right)}$$\\end{document}: Position vector of the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:i$$\\end{document}-the in the reference structure (e.g., initial structure).\n\n## Radius of gyration\nThe radius of gyration (Rg) is a measure of the spatial distribution of atoms around the molecule\u2019s center of mass, reflecting its compactness and conformational state. It is calculated as the root mean square distance of each atom from the center of mass, weighted by their masses, using the equation30.\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{R}_{g}=\\:\\sqrt{\\frac{{\\sum\\:}_{i=1}^{N}{m}_{i\\left({r}_{i}-\\:{r}_{cm}\\right)}^{2}}{{\\sum\\:}_{i=1}^{N}{m}_{i}}}$$\\end{document}\nWhere, mi = Mass of the ith atom, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{r}_{i}$$\\end{document} = Position of the ith atom, rcm = is the center of mass of the molecule.\nThe radius of gyration is commonly used in molecular dynamics to assess structural compactness and conformational changes of macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.\n\n## SASA\nThe solvent accessible surface area measures the area of a protein molecule that comes into direct contact with water. This matrix provides aspects to study protein folding and unfolding. Several methods are available to estimate solvent accessible surface area, including the Z-layer integration method, intersection method, the Shrake and Rupley algorithm, the linear combinations of pairwise overlaps (LCPO) method, power diagram method, and artificial neural network (ANN)31. The YASARA software package uses the rolling ball proposed by A. Shrake and J. Rupley that places a probe sphere of 1.4 \u00c5 in different positions of the protein, representing a solvent molecule. The spherical surface of each is shielded with 92 equally placed probes, and the total area of exposed and overlapped spheres is measured, and the total accessible surface area is calculated32,33.\n\n## Hydrogen bonds\nProteins in a biological environment are enveloped by water molecules that form a dynamic network through hydrogen bonds protein and the solvent itself. Studies reveal that 85% of protein-ligand complexes involve at least one water molecule bridging the ligand and protein34. The ubiquitous nature of water to accept and donate H-bonds plays a crucial role in protein folding and protein ligand interaction. Bulk water can hinder reversible biological processes, with enthalpy-entropy compensation taking place during hydrogen bond formation. Additionally, hydrogen bonds contribute to ligand binding affinity by driving protein-bound water molecules into the surrounding solvent35. For ligand binding to occur, these water molecules need to be rearranged or displaced36. Docking studies traditionally ignored ordered water molecules, concentrating on desolvated binding sites. In contrast, dynamic simulation studies incorporate explicit water molecules, improving accuracy as these molecules frequently act as essential pharmacophoric components, and their deliberate displacement significantly impacts the chemical diversity of potential inhibitors34.\n\n## Statistical data analysis\nStatistical data analysis was executed using GraphPad Prism software (v10.1.2). Statistically significant P-values were estimated using Two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test between different groups for percentage of body weight changes, total white blood cell (WBC) count, CRP level, and ESR test. Statistical power analysis was performed using G*Power software (v3.1.9.7), where achieved power was computed based on effect size (Cohen\u2019s d), sample size, and significance level (\u03b1)37.\n\n## Results\nDrug repurposing involves developing new indications or clinical uses for a drug typically used for different disease conditions. It has gained popularity in the pharmaceutical industry due to the availability of cheaper and faster drug discovery options compared to de novo drug development9. We investigated the antimicrobial activity of flupentixol and its additive effects on existing antibiotics. Consequently, we first performed a disk diffusion test to determine the zone of inhibition of the investigated drugs (antibiotics and non-antibiotics) alone and in combination against three bacterial species. Then, we performed their minimum inhibitory concentration, followed by their biological activity in a shigellosis mouse model. An in silico approach demonstrates the interaction of flupentixol with several efflux pump proteins.\n\n## Disk diffusion test\nTable\u00a02 presents the zones of inhibition observed for flupentixol alone and in combination with selected antibiotics against three pathogenic microorganisms. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Shigella boydii AL 17313, flupentixol demonstrated mean antibacterial activity of 12.67\u2009\u00b1\u20091.15\u00a0mm, 15.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58\u00a0mm, and 13.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58\u00a0mm, respectively. In case of combination drugs against P. aeruginosa ATCC9027, Cip\u2009+\u2009Flu and Gen\u2009+\u2009Flu showed a prominent increase in zone of inhibition compared to other combinations. For S. aureus ATCC 25923, synergism was seen for the Cip\u2009+\u2009Flu combination.

For P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, a significant reduction in the MIC was observed with the Cip\u2009+\u2009Flu and Gen\u2009+\u2009Flu combinations, corresponding to an average three-fold and two-fold decrease, respectively. For S. aureus ATCC 25,923, the Oxy\u2009+\u2009Flu, Cip\u2009+\u2009Flu, and Gen\u2009+\u2009Flu combinations were effective in reducing the MIC values. For S. boydii AL 17,313, the Oxy\u2009+\u2009Flu and Cip\u2009+\u2009Flu combinations resulted in a significant reduction in MIC values, decreasing from 64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0\u00b5g/mL to 26.67\u2009\u00b1\u20097.27\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for Oxy\u2009+\u2009Flu, and from 2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0\u00b5g/mL to 0.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for Cip\u2009+\u2009Flu.\nTable 3Demonstrated the MIC of flupentixol alone and in combination with different classes of antibiotics against two gram-negative and one gram-positive pathogen.DrugsP. aeruginosa ATCC9027S. aureus ATCC 25923S. boydii AL 17313Flu53.33\u2009\u00b1\u200915.0732\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0164\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Oxy106.67\u2009\u00b1\u200929.4426.67\u2009\u00b1\u20097.2764\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Oxy\u2009+\u2009Flu128\u2009\u00b1\u20090.011.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8726.67\u2009\u00b1\u20097.27Dox16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.013.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9410.67\u2009\u00b1\u20093.77Dox\u2009+\u2009Flu10.67\u2009\u00b1\u20093.771.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.475.33\u2009\u00b1\u20091.89Chl170.67\u2009\u00b1\u200959.253.33\u2009\u00b1\u200914.14256\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Chl\u2009+\u2009Flu128\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0142.67\u2009\u00b1\u200914.14170.67\u2009\u00b1\u200959.2Pen G213.33\u2009\u00b1\u200959.232\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01256\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Pen G\u2009+\u2009Flu106.67\u2009\u00b1\u200929.4424\u2009\u00b1\u200911.31128\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Ery512\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01128\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01213.33\u2009\u00b1\u200959.2Ery\u2009+\u2009Flu256\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0153.33\u2009\u00b1\u200914.14128\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Cip3.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.941.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.472\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Cip\u2009+\u2009Flu0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.010.0625\u2009\u00b1\u20090.010.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Gen64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0185.33\u2009\u00b1\u200929.4413.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.77Gen\u2009+\u2009Flu16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0113.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7764\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01Here, Flu: Flupentixol, Oxy: Oxytetracycline, Dox: Doxycycline, Chl: Chloramphenicol, Pen G: Penicillin G, Ery: Erythromycin, Cip: Ciprofloxacin, Gen: Gentamicin.\n\n## Outcome of ciprofloxacin and its combinations on body weight\nBody weights were measured for each group on the first, third, and seventh days; the percentage of body weight change was calculated and is demonstrated in Fig.\u00a01a. Shigellosis induced by S. boydii AL 17313 had a significant effect on the body weight of mice. The percentage of body weight change in the control group exhibited a gradual increase, whereas the diseased group showed a significant reduction. The difference between the control and diseased groups was statistically significant on day 3 (P\u2009<\u20090.01, d\u2009=\u20093.24, power\u2009=\u200976%) and on day 7 (P\u2009<\u20090.0001, d\u2009=\u20097.94, power\u2009=\u200982%). Treatment groups, including ciprofloxacin alone and in combination with flupentixol, demonstrated weight recovery. There was no statistically significant difference on day 3; however, significance was observed on day 7 (P\u2009<\u20090.01, d = \u2013 2.46, power\u2009=\u200948%).\n\n## Outcome of ciprofloxacin and its combinations on total WBC count\nHematological parameters, such as total WBC count, provide insight into the immune response to antigens and the body\u2019s inflammatory state38. Total WBC counts were determined and compared among groups to find out the curative effect of the treatment groups. In comparison to the control and diseased groups, the total WBC count was significantly elevated in the diseased group (P < 0.0001, d = 10.1, power = 97%), suggesting a heightened inflammatory response caused by shigellosis. As shown in Table 4; Fig. 1b, the ciprofloxacin treatment group had a higher WBC count than the combination treatment group (Cip + Flu), with the difference being statistically significant. This indicates that the combination treatment is more effective (P < 0.05, d = 2.57, power = 85%) in restoring the WBC count to normal levels than ciprofloxacin alone.\n\n## Outcome of ciprofloxacin and its combinations on CRP levels\nCRP levels were also determined to evaluate the treatment group\u2019s capability to alleviate it. Elevated CRP levels represented increased inflammatory cytokines in the body39. As shown in Table 4; Fig. 1c, CRP levels were significantly higher in the diseased group compared to the control group (P < 0.0001, d = \u2013 10.22, power = 97%). The combination group had a better alleviation capacity, although the difference was not statistically significant.\n\n## Outcome of ciprofloxacin and its combinations on ESR\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test is a diagnostic test that specifies inflammatory conditions within the body arising from several diseases, infections, and tumors. An elevated ESR level indicates the presence of specific inflammatory cytokines and disease progression39. The ESR level determined for every group is summarized in Table 4; Fig. 1d. In comparison between the control group and the diseased group, elevated levels of ESR indicate a higher inflammatory state associated with shigellosis (P < 0.0001, d = -8.43, power = 87%). Treatment groups alleviated inflammatory states at different levels. However, higher ESR levels were found in the ciprofloxacin group compared to the combination group Cip + Flu, indicating that the combination group has a greater capability to reduce the body\u2019s inflammatory condition compared to ciprofloxacin alone, which is statistically significant for Cip + Flu (P < 0.01, d = 3.74, power = 88%).\nTable 4Presents the effects of various experimental groups, including the control group, diseased group, and treatment groups, on white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in mice.GroupTotal WBC count (thousand/mm3)CRP/mlESR level (mm/hr)Control group7.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.711.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6411.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52Diseased group12.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1521.82\u2009\u00b1\u20092.6719.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2Ciprofloxacin8.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1511.36\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2413\u2009\u00b1\u20090.577Cip\u2009+\u2009Flu7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.538.89\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2510.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75Cip: Ciprofloxacin; flu: Flupentixol\nFig. 1Outcomes of ciprofloxacin and its combination with flupentixol on (a) percentage of body weight changes, (b) total WBC count, (c) CRP level, and (d) ESR level.

NorA protein is a multidrug-resistant efflux pump from Staphylococcus aureus that expels a broad range of antibiotics, such as quinolones and fluoroquinolones, from the bacterial cell. Structurally, NorA belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) efflux pump41. The other two efflux pump proteins, MexA (PDB ID: 6IOK) and AcrB (PDB ID: 4CDI), originated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027 and Escherichia coli, and belong to the efflux pump superfamily named the Resistance Nodulation Division (RND)42,43. Flupentixol is an antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class that acts primarily by blocking the dopamine D2 receptor in the brain. A study proposed that the NorA efflux pump inhibitory effect may underlie the synergistic activity of flupentixol against multidrug-resistant S. aureus44. To assess the efflux pump inhibitory potential, a docking study was carried out on these three efflux pumps belonging to two superfamilies.\nThe results of the molecular docking study targeting efflux pump proteins are presented in Table 5 and (Fig. 2a\u2013c), with flupentixol as the test ligand and ciprofloxacin as the reference ligand. Key residues of the NorA protein (PDB ID: 7LO8) protein involved in modulating its function include Phe16, Phe140, Phe303, Phe306, Arg98, Glu222, Asp307, and Arg31045. As shown in Table 5, the 7LO8 + flupentixol complex displayed a binding affinity of \u2212 8.4 kcal/mol, whereas the control complex 7LO8 + ciprofloxacin exhibited \u2212 8.1 kcal/mol. Both ligands interacted with overlapping key residues of NorA, as shown in Fig. 2a: flupentixol bound to Gln51, Asn340, Phe16, and Phe140, whereas ciprofloxacin interacted with Gln51, Phe16, Ile136, Phe140, Thr336, and Thr113. Flupentixol formed two hydrogen bonds with Gln51 and Asn340 in 7LO8, while ciprofloxacin formed a single hydrogen bond with Gln51. A higher hydrogen bond count correlates with greater complex stability, suggesting potential inhibition of efflux pumps. Hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of protein\u2013ligand complexes46. For 6IOK, as shown in Fig. 2b, flupentixol and ciprofloxacin displayed comparable binding affinities of \u2212 7.98 Kcal/mol and \u2212 7.9 Kcal/mol, respectively. For AcrB (PDB ID: 4CDI), as illustrated in Fig. 2c, 4CDI bound to Flupentixol exhibited a slightly lower binding affinity (-7.25 Kcal/mol) compared to the control complex, 4CDI + Ciprofloxacin (\u2212 7.5 Kcal/mol).
