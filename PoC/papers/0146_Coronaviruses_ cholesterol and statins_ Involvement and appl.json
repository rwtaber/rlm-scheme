  "abstract": "The infectious power of coronaviruses is dependent on cholesterol present in the membranes of their target cells. Indeed, the virus enters the infected cell either by fusion or by endocytosis, in both cases involving cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains. These membrane domains can be disorganized in-vitro by various cholesterol-altering agents, including statins that inhibit cell cholesterol biosynthesis. As a consequence, numerous cell physiology processes, such as signaling cascades, can be compromised. Also, some examples of anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects of statins have been observed for infectious agents known to be cholesterol dependent. In-vivo, besides their widely-reported hypocholesterolemic effect, statins display various pleiotropic effects mediated, at least partially, by perturbation of membrane microdomains as a consequence of the alteration of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. It should thus be worth considering a high, but clinically well-tolerated, dose of statin to treat Covid-19 patients, in the early phase of infection, to inhibit virus entry into the target cells, in order to control the viral charge and hence avoid severe clinical complications. Based on its efficacy and favorable biodisposition, an option would be considering Atorvastatin, but randomized controlled clinical trials are required to test this hypothesis. This new therapeutic proposal takes benefit from being a drug repurposing, applied to a widely-used drug presenting a high efficiency-to-toxicity ratio. Additionally, this therapeutic strategy avoids any risk of drug resistance by viral mutation since it is host-targeted. Noteworthy, the same pharmacological approach could also be proposed to address different animal coronavirus endemic infections that are responsible for heavy economic losses.",

This has shed light on the whole coronaviridae family, although some members of this family have been rather well previously described. Along with various veterinary infections in wild or farmed animals, essentially mammals, four human strains have been reported to cause common cold and benign flu in young adult (strains OC43 and 229E), with infrequent pulmonary complications (strains NL63 and HKU1), besides rare severe hemorrhagic diarrhea in newborn [1]. In 2003 in China, the serious epidemic episode of atypical pulmonary infections introduced the novel virus SARS-CoV1, followed in 2012 in some other countries by the related MERS-CoV that provoked the \u201cMiddle-East respiratory syndrome\u201d, with an even higher fatality rate although remaining fairly limited in case number. These two related viruses, together with SARS-CoV-2, are responsible with a rather high frequency for a typical \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d, leading to oxygen therapy and intensive care supports. As a matter of fact, these viruses are capable to conjugate a very high infectiousness with potentially intense clinical alterations, SARS-CoV-2 being the most successful up to now to well adapt to the host by mutagenesis, considering its virulence and worldwide spreading. Virologist community thus started to investigate them more deeply, and began to reveal their biological and molecular characteristics [2,3]. Among their various properties underlying their unusual pathogenic power, there are a noticeable molecular plasticity and adaptability (which has allowed the virus to bypass species barrier) along with a multifunction capability of some viral proteins as well as some possibilities of functional supplementation between different viral proteins, optimizing viral metabolism and giving flexibility and robustness to the replication cycle.\nThese characteristics point to the difficulty to specifically target a viral protein to inhibit virus replication, taking into account that new mutants possibly inducing resistances to specific pharmacological agents can always emerge. It is therefore worth considering the alternative possibility of targeting the host, focussing on the specific interactions between the virus components and the infected cell during the viral replication cycle. Among the successive steps of the virus cycle, the entry, the intracellular formation of the replication complexes accompanied by membrane remodeling, and the budding of the neo-formed virions are all different membrane phases that are complex molecular events, involving a number of biochemical components with fine regulations. These membrane steps may thus represent valuable pharmacological opportunities [4]. This approach can be related to the concept of \u201cmembrane lipid therapy\u201d, as recently proposed in the context of anticancer therapy [5]. Therefore, a membrane biophysical approach could be fruitful when combined with the more classical strategies coming from molecular and cellular biology. Especially, such an approach is expected to avoid the risk of pharmacological resistance that could be due to a pertinent, selection-induced mutation of a specifically targeted viral protein.\nWe therefore focus this review on the dependence of coronaV cell entry, and hence infectivity, on membrane cholesterol in the target cells, providing a sound basis for considering statins as potential agents able to modulate it. Indeed, these inhibitors of cell cholesterol biosynthesis are well observed in-vitro to disorganize the cholesterol-rich membrane domains, such as rafts and caveolae. The possibility of in-vivo application of this property relies on the widely-reported \u201cpleiotropic effects\u201d of statins (i.e. independent of the decreased circulating LDL-cholesterol), which are attributed, at least in part, to perturbations of cell and membrane cholesterol. This can thus be extrapolated to a promising inhibiting effect on coronaV cell entry, which may provide, thanks to statins repurposing, a new therapeutic strategy that will deserve being tested by preclinical assays and clinical studies.\n\n## Entry: cell-surface fusion and endocytosis, both dependent on plasma membrane cholesterol\nNumerous experimental studies have addressed the biology of coronaV infections of various animals, especially farmed species because of the heavy economic losses caused by epidemic events. The remarkable point is that, for all these studied animal strains of coronaV, the sensitivity to infection of in-vitro cultured cells presents a clear dependence on cholesterol. In a first set of pioneering experiments, cholesterol supplementation of the culture medium of cells infected by the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) can induce an increased virus-mediated cell fusion and modulate virus persistence in the cells [[6], [7], [8]]. Alternatively, treatment of cultured cells by the cholesterol-chelating agent methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) regularly induces a decrease of virus entry and infection when challenged by the MHV [8,9], the porcine transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (PTGEV) [10,11], the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [12,13], the porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) [14], the avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) [15], the type I (but not type II) feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV or FCoV) [16,17], the canine enteric virus (CECoV) [18] or the canine respiratory virus (CRCoV) [19], as well as by the human HCoV-229E [20], HCoV-OC43 [21] and SARS-CoV1 [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. The analysis of the underlying mechanism strongly indicated the involvement of membrane microdomains enriched in, and dependent on cholesterol, whatever their precise molecular composition [26], whose integrity appears necessary for virus internalization into the target cell. These membrane domains have been identified as lipid rafts in the case of SARS-CoV1 [23,25], and to caveolae (revealed by caveolin-1) in the case of AIBV [15], PEDV [13], PTGEV [27], CRCoV [19], HCoV-229E [20], HCoV-OC43 [21] and SARS-CoV1 [24]. The process for cell entry of the virus via these cholesterol-dependent membrane domains has been attributed to receptor-mediated endocytosis in some cases, either depending on clathrin (MHV, PHEV, PEDV, PTGEV, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV1) [13,14,[27], [28], [29], [30]] or not (FCoV, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV1) [17,21,25], but most often depending on dynamin [13,17,19,21,27,30]. In the case of such delayed endocytic pathway, the virus entry is due to the fusion of its membrane with that of endosomes induced by the local acidification. However, the cell entry of the virus has also been reported to follow a direct entry pathway thanks to a process of membrane fusion at the cell surface, especially in the cases of the human viruses [31,32].\nThe mechanisms of \u201cfusion\u201d for virus entry into the target cell is made possible by the fact that the coronaV are enveloped viruses, whose viral lipids can mix with the host plasma membrane lipids when they are in proper contact. This mixing step requires the specific interaction of the Spike glycoprotein (\u201cS protein\u201d) harbored by the virion surface with its corresponding cell receptor, ACE2 in case of SARS-CoV1/CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63, DPP4 (=CD26) for MERS-CoV, APN (=CD13) for HCoV-229E and various animal coronaV strains, O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43 and HKU1, CEACAM1 for MHV [2,3,8,[33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]]. In all cases, the S protein is composed of two subdomains (S1 and S2) with distinct functions, S1 being responsible for the initial recognition and binding to the cell receptor, and S2 for the subsequent step of lipid fusion. This important step of fusion of viral and cell membranes is allowed by a large and complex S2 protein transconformation induced by local cell proteases, including furin-type proprotein convertases for the priming cleavage (S1/S2 site) and the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 for the triggering cleavage (S2\u2019 site) releasing the fusion protein [2,[33], [34], [35], [36],[38], [39], [40], [41]]. The point is that this necessary structural, protein and lipid reorganization is cholesterol dependent [33,42], including when considering SARS-CoV1 [41] and SARS-CoV-2 [43,44]. In addition, the two protein partners, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, of this specific interaction are colocalized in cholesterol-rich membrane domains, giving them their functional specificity, since this connectivity is decisive for virus entry (and hence infectivity) [9,22,45]. Also, the cell proteases required for virus entry have been shown to co-segregate with some tetraspanins, including CD9 for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, leading to the proposition that tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEM) constitute membrane platforms suited for the virus entry [34,46,47]. This makes sense since these TEM are known to be enriched in cholesterol [48,49].\nAs a whole, coronaV can enter the target cells both by endocytosis and by \u201cearly\u201d membrane fusion, depending on the considered virus strain, the cell type and the host cell factors [33,41], and finally it appears that the fusion mechanism is more efficient, especially in humans [32,34,41]. However, the remarkable point is that these two processes are both dependent on the cholesterol content within the host cell plasma membrane.\n\n## Intracellular membrane remodeling and budding\nThe viral lipid envelope sometimes contains cholesterol, which suggests that the virus budding can occurs from a cholesterol-enriched membrane [18]. However, treatment before infection of the virus envelope using M\u03b2CD has an influence on the infectivity only in some cases, depending on the animal virus strain [12,50]. For the human strains, coronaV are reported as budding at the level of a specific intracellular membrane compartment forming an intermediate between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, the \u201cERGIC\u201d [2,51,52], a region thus containing rather low level of cholesterol. This budding process is accompanied by an important reorganization of these internal membrane compartments, with the formation of a reticulo-vesicular network, \u201cconvoluted\u201d membranes, vesicle packets, and double-membrane vesicles, which are thought to nest the viral replication complexes [2,3,51,53,54]. Besides, the trans-Golgi network (TGN), richer in cholesterol, is believed to be an obligatory step for the trafficking of M protein [55], which represents the \u201cdriving force\u201d of the viral assembly, due to its oligomerization ability possibly leading to membrane curvature, as well as its association with N protein [52]. In addition, E protein, while contributing to membrane curvature with M protein, and otherwise facilitating the intracellular traffic of S protein [56], can form a pentameric ionic channel, viroporin, whose function and selectivity depend on the local conditions, especially lipid composition (including cholesterol) [57,58]. However, within the current knowledge, it appears that the membrane-linked events involved in the intracellular steps of the replication cycle are not stringently dependent on cholesterol, although some cholesterol influence on the assembly and/or the budding phase cannot be discarded, as observed for various other viruses [59,60].\nOtherwise, statins have been reported to have possible antiviral effects on some viruses, but they recover a variety of different mechanisms of action, often involving various signaling cascades, most often downward the virus entry step, and generally independent of cholesterol-containing membrane domains [61]. Alternatively, it has been proposed that a highly sensitive step to be pharmacologically targeted in the replication cycle of an enveloped virus is its cell entry [62], which involves lipid rafts in the case of coronaV [63,64]. It is worth emphazing here that, beyond the presence of ACE2 within the plasma membrane rafts, the meaningful point is the cholesterol dependence of its colocalization with TMPRSS2. In conclusion, the most pertinent effect of cholesterol on coronaV infectivity relies on its entry phase, when the virus interacts with the host cell plasma membrane cholesterol-rich domains, and we thus address the question of a possible action of statins at that level.\n\nAll the above-mentioned characteristics on the cellular replication cycle of coronaV show that it would be desirable to alter the cell cholesterol, especially in the plasma membrane, in order to control its cell entry and hence the deleterious effects induced by the viral infectious properties. There exists some biochemical agents (e.g. M\u03b2CD, filipin, saponin, cholesterol oxidase) aimed at efficiently perturbing membrane cholesterol in-vitro by altering its concentration or distribution in raft-type microdomains, hence altering their associated functions [[65], [66], [67], [68]]; unfortunately, these molecules would be too toxic to be used in-vivo, especially in clinics. However, this is not the case for a family of related molecules that is well-known for a wide use as preventive drugs, thus fairly safe, in cardio-vascular risk patients: the statins (chemical structures in Ref.\u00a0[69]).\n\n## Cellular effects: alteration of various cell signaling pathways\nStatins are biochemically defined as (competitive) inhibitors of HMGCoAR (hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl CoenzymeA reductase), the limiting step enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of cholesterol. As a consequence of the decreased synthesis rate of cholesterol in cultured cells treated in-vitro by a statin, their membrane lipid rafts, and other cholesterol-enriched microdomains, are disorganized, and hence lose their various functionalities [61]. Noteworthy, at the level of the cell, either cultured in the presence of cholesterol or in in-vivo situation exposed to circulating lipoproteins, the exogenous cholesterol, bound to these lipoproteins and internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, mainly accumulates within the internal membranes, while cholesterol in the plasma membrane is mainly of endogenous origin [70,71], and is thus preferentially perturbed by the action of statins.\nAmong the numerous cellular effects of statins that have been observed involving functional alterations of cholesterol-dependent membrane domains, a few of them will be described here as illustrating examples of signaling platform perturbations, with raft disruption as the proven underlying mechanism. It should be stated at this stage that the inhibition of HMGCoAR also leads to a decreased synthesis rate of the non-cholesterol branches of the mevalonate pathway that produce protein prenylations and other various acylations. Since protein acylation is a common post-transcriptional regulation mechanism of membrane proteins involved in signaling cascades, it can often produce various cellular effects, typically playing a role in cell growth, thus potentially in tumor biology. Thus any statin-induced cell perturbation must be carefully analyzed to ascertain that it is mediated by its action at the level of the membrane rafts or caveolae, since these structures are actually forming active signaling platforms. Several pertinent examples are found in the literature, such as the perturbation of the Akt signaling cascade: SimvaSt lowered raft cholesterol content in prostate cancer cells [72] and in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells [73], and in leukemia cells where the rescue was obtained by adding mevalonate or squalene, but not isoprenoid compounds [74]. Similarly, in pancreas cancer cells, LovaSt deregulated CD133/FAK signaling by disrupting the lipid rafts, leading to chemosensitization [75]. In EGF signaling pathway, LovaSt and AtorvaSt depleted lipid rafts of cholesterol and altered raft location of EGFR, recovering EGF signaling in breast cancer cells [76], while MevaSt activated EGFR signaling through disruption of caveolae in keratinocytes [77], and SimvaSt suppressed the phosphorylation of EGFR in astrocytes [78]. As another example of a typical situation, AtorvaSt has been shown to modulate the recruitment of signaling molecules (Lck) into the lipid rafts of T cells that constitute the immunological synapse [79]. Similarly, AtorvaSt also inhibited the recruitment of the LPS receptor, TLR4, into the lipid rafts of pro-B cells, leading to an anti-inflammatory response that could be rescued by mevalonate [80]. Also, FluvaSt inhibited Fc\u03b3 receptor signaling in monocyte rafts, which was rescued by mevalonate, whereas the use of prenyl transferase inhibitors was without effect, thus indicating the involvement of these cholesterol-rich membrane domains [81]. Finally, PravaSt (at the low concentration of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM) counteracted the deleterious effect of exposure to benzo(a)pyrene and ethanol of hepatic cells and of obese zebrafish larvae liver, which was mediated by membrane remodeling altering cholesterol-containing rafts that mediate inflammatory signaling [82].\n\n## Anti-infectious effects: some examples with tentative extrapolations to \nThe lipid rafts have also been reported as membrane platforms mediating cell entry of various, bacterial as well as viral, pathogens [4,59,83].\n\n## Anti-bacterial effects\nThe cell internalization of the obligatory intracellular bacteria, Helicobacter, into gastric cells requires lipid rafts, and statins have been shown to decrease this internalization, as followed by the decreased delivery of the virulence factor, CagA [84]. In addition, treatment by statins of macrophages infested by Listeria [85] or by Mycobacterium [86] leads to an increase of the phagosomal degradation of the bacteria as a consequence of the decreased cell cholesterol. This last case of anti-infectious effect has also been demonstrated in-vivo on a murin model.\n\n## Anti-viral effects: HCV, BKV, and animal CoV as the \u201cmissing link\u201d\nIn hepatocytes infected by the HCV, viral replication occurs at the Golgi level, with budding in the TGN that recruits raft-like membrane domains. This reveals the cholesterol dependence of the viral cycle, which can be inhibited by treatment of the infected cells with a statin (5\u00a0\u03bcM LovaSt) [87]. Among the different statins tested in-vitro to inhibit HCV replication, FluvaSt showed the best efficacy, followed by AtorvaSt and SimvaSt, all in the \u03bcM range [88]. On the basis of these in-vitro data, the administration of a conventional dose of AtorvaSt used to reduce hypercholesterolemia has been tested on infected patients who were otherwise hyperlipidemic. However, no antiviral effect could be observed, but it could be objected that the applied dose could have been insufficient taking into account the metabolic profile of these patients [89]. In contrast, a high dose of FluvaSt (20\u2013320\u00a0mg/d) has been observed to induce transient reductions of the viral load for periods of few weeks [90].\nBKV virus, from the SV40 family, is chronically present in the urinary tract in latent form, and can be reactivated in an opportunistic manner in grafted kidneys as a consequence of the required immunomodulating treatments, questioning the functional prognosis of the transplantation. Virus internalization into the kidney cells occurs by caveolar endocytosis [91]. Treatment of these infected cells by PravaSt, which disorganizes the caveolae by downregulating caveolin-1, either directly or by decreasing membrane cholesterol, has an antiviral effect more marked when the drug is given at an early phase of the infection [92]. This in-vitro effect is the basis for proposing statins as a new therapeutic approach of this infection, for which no satisfactory treatment exists [93].\nRegarding coronaV, there is one report of using a statin, MevaSt, to disorganize membrane rafts with an antiviral effect, hence indicating their involvement in the viral cycle of AIBV [15]. This in-vitro effect is similar to that obtained using M\u03b2CD, and is focused on the viral cell entry phase, but not the replication or the budding phases. At this stage, this report constitutes the precious \u201cmissing link\u201d between the cholesterol dependence of coronaV infectivity, including in particular the SARS-CoV1 [[22], [23], [24], [25]], and the anti-infectious effects displayed by statins against various other cholesterol-dependent pathogens.\nFor HCV and BKV, these anti-viral in-vitro data have set the bases for proposing statins as a new therapeutic approach possibly applied in-vivo, for preclinical or/and clinical assays (that would need to be further investigated), which thus could be also proposed for coronaV.\n\n## Hypocholesterolemic effect and upregulation of LDLR\nThe in-vivo mechanisms of action of statins have been widely addressed [69,[94], [95], [96]]. Statins are the first-line treatment for hypercholesterolemia in patients at cardio-vascular risk. Their action relies on decreasing the level of circulating LDL-cholesterol, this decrease being the consequence of a positive regulation of the LDLR induced by the cholesterol sensor, SREBP, present in the ER where cholesterol synthesis is inhibited, mainly in the hepatocytes, hence promoting LDL clearance. But this is not the sole mechanism of action, as demonstrated by the only partial, but significant, effect of statins when treating patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) that are devoid of LDLR [[97], [98], [99]], although it could be argued that this is linked to some residual LDLR [100]. Anyway, this specific statin effect points to the relevance of a direct effect of cholesterol synthesis inhibition at the level of the whole cells in the organism.\n\n## Pleiotropic effects and the involvement of cell and membrane cholesterol\nWhen used in clinics, statins also exhibit various biological effects besides the decreased level of circulating cholesterol [69,95]. These widely-reported \u201cpleiotropic effects\u201d mainly include immuno-modulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-oxidant properties, and are considered for their beneficial side-effects in various therapeutic applications in cardio-vascular diseases. The underlying mechanisms, generally addressed using various cell models, appear rather multiple and entangled, since these pleiotropic effects can be, at least in part, mediated by alteration of the expression and function of various prenylated membrane proteins that are often involved in signaling processes in various cell types. However, based on above-mentioned in-vitro observations [79,80,101,102], the various biological effects of statins, such as immuno-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects, and also anti-oxidant effects, appear often mediated by perturbations of cell signaling relying on cholesterol-enriched membrane domains. Indeed, aside perturbing rafts as signaling platforms, the disruption of these domains was also reported to inhibit cell-surface expression of MHC-II and other immuno-modulatory proteins [103]. Also regarding immunocompetent cells, NK cytotoxic function was decreased by SimvaSt or FluvaSt, and this was correlated with membrane raft alteration, in a similar manner to a treatment by M\u03b2CD but not by isoprenyl transferase inhibition [104]. Regarding endothelial cells, AtorvaSt was shown on HUVEC to upregulate anti-oxidative lipid raft proteins, while downregulating CRP associated with inflammation and cell adhesion [105]. Also in endothelial cells, LovaSt and AtorvaSt induced inhibition of LOX-1, the receptor to oxidized LDL, by disruption of caveolin-containing lipid rafts as a consequence of cholesterol reduction, which highly decreased the receptor fraction associated to these membrane domains [101]. Furthermore, in coronary arterial endothelium, PravaSt and SimvaSt altered the redox signaling pathway induced by oxidized LDL thanks to the simultaneous inhibition of the association of the NADPH oxidase subunits and of the eNOS repression by caveolin-1, in both cases by disrupting the membrane rafts due to lowering membrane cholesterol [102].\nThe various pleiotropic effects of statins can also rely on more general mechanisms of perturbation of various cholesterol-containing membrane domains, such as caveolae and TEM, and even cell cholesterol, with alteration of endocytosis among other consequences. In particular, cholesterol perturbations can induce changes of expression of caveolins that thereby promote various alterations of cell biochemical cascades, thus producing a variety of cellular effects. As a matter of fact, SimvaSt decreases caveolin-1 expression in cultured castration-resistant prostate cancer cells [106], PravaSt induces in-vitro dysregulation of various gene expression in cancer cells correlated with a decreased caveolae density [107], and SimvaSt decreases caveolin-3 expression and caveolae number in cultured cardiac myocytes with accompanying changes in calcium fluxes and NO production [108]. Furthermore, statins cause changes in the cholesterol distribution between different membrane domains: PravaSt is able to shift cholesterol from caveolae to \u201cflat rafts\u201d in monocytes ex-vivo cultured after myocardial infarction to a level similar to that observed in healthy donors [109]. Also, beyond affecting caveolin signaling, statins also perturb various cholesterol-enriched membrane domains, as shown by the induced redistribution of the LPS receptor, CD14, from \u201cclassical\u201d rafts to TEM, with as a consequence an anti-inflammatory effect on cultured macrophages [110]. Finally, statins can alter endocytosis, known to be cholesterol-dependent, both morphologically in smooth muscle cells at the level of Golgi with an effect similar to that of cholesterol oxidase [111], and functionally as shown for the GPCR serotonin receptor 1A that switches from a clathrin-mediated to a caveolae-mediated pathway due to cholesterol depletion [112]. More generally regarding the functional importance of cell cholesterol, as an example, MevaStat as well as zaragozic acid (inhibiting only cholesterol synthesis) can resensitize cultured AM leukemia cells to radio and chemotherapy by decreasing the protecting effect of a high level of cell cholesterol [113].\n\n## Tentative extrapolation from \nGlobally, all these cellular effects reported for statins on various cell models allowed to delineate their underlying processes, and provide convergent indications that cell and/or membrane cholesterol is involved as the common molecular factor, whatever the biological alteration observed downward. It should be acknowledged that, in some cases, such a cholesterol-dependent mechanism is not exclusive from other molecular mechanisms, such as alteration of cell signaling by inhibition of isoprenylation [95,114]. However, the common mechanistic link based on membrane cholesterol provides a pertinent unifying mode of action underlying many pleiotropic statin effects.\nAs a direct attempt to evidence an in-vitro/in-vivo correlation, functional perturbations of lymphocytes have been assayed on cultured cells and parallel ex-vivo collection after oral statin treatment, and compared for membrane raft alteration in both situations [115]: 40\u00a0mg/d SimvaSt induced lower effects than 1\u00a0\u03bcM in the culture medium, with a quantity of rafts somehow decreased in the ex-vivo determination, although without statistical significance, showing the experimental difficulties of such an approach. However, these data qualitatively show that, in that range, the in-vitro concentration vs in-vivo dose values of statin can produce comparable molecular effects on membrane rafts.\nIt is finally noteworthy that these multiform statin effects and their underlying mechanisms are clearly dependent on the cell type considered [107,113,116]. In addition, mechanistic analyses are often hampered by the use of various experimental conditions, including in particular different statin concentrations used in-vitro and in-vivo [117], and different weight doses for animals and humans [118]. However, as a whole, it appears that the statins present a complex clinical pharmacology with entangled underlying mechanisms, which are nevertheless more or less mediated by perturbations of cellular cholesterol pools relevant in functional membrane domains, that can be observed even for short duration treatments. Actually, to conclude from the presented data, the existence of such cholesterol-dependent pleiotropic effects witnesses, and provides strong indication, that statins are able to efficiently alter plasma membrane cholesterol in clinical situation.\n\n## Biological and pharmacological rationale\nThe analysis of the above-exposed biological and pharmacological data prompt us to consider that statins could be used as a \u201cready-to-use\u201d pharmacological tool to fight against Covid-19, and it should be desirable to propose it as a drug family to be tested in the early phase of viral infection (see Scheme 1\n). Indeed, as detailed above: (i) SARS-CoV-2\u00a0cell entry is cholesterol dependent due to the location of its specific receptor, ACE2, in membrane rafts, (ii) the in-vitro cell entry, and hence infectivity, of a related animal coronaV, AIBV, can be inhibited by a statin, and (iii) statins can display various in-vivo effects that are relied on functional perturbations of cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane domains. It can thus be fairly hypothesized that in-vivo administered statins could exhibit an anti-infectious effect on SARS-CoV-2 by altering its cholesterol-dependent entry into the target cells (see Scheme 2\n). It should be pointed that this therapeutic strategy is designed for the control of the viral dissemination in the target tissues, i.e. essentially the respiratory tract, but not only, as the gastro-intestinal tract [119] and the endothelia [[120], [121], [122], [123]] are also typically concerned. Indeed, it is noteworthy that, besides pulmonary epithel",
