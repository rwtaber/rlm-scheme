  "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19, continues to threaten global public health. COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease, causing not only respiratory distress, but also extrapulmonary manifestations, including gastrointestinal symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool long after respiratory clearance. Despite global vaccination and existing antiviral treatments, variants of concern are still emerging and circulating. Of note, new Omicron BA.5 sublineages both increasingly evade neutralizing antibodies and demonstrate an increased preference for entry via the endocytic entry route. Alternative to direct-acting antivirals, host-directed therapies interfere with host mechanisms hijacked by viruses, and enhance cell-mediated resistance with a reduced likelihood of drug resistance development. Here, we demonstrate that the autophagy-blocking therapeutic berbamine dihydrochloride robustly prevents SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by human intestinal epithelial cells via an autophagy-mediated BNIP3 mechanism. Strikingly, berbamine dihydrochloride exhibited pan-antiviral activity against Omicron subvariants BA.2 and BA.5 at nanomolar potency, providing a proof of concept for the potential for targeting autophagy machinery to thwart infection of current circulating SARS-CoV-2 subvariants. Furthermore, we show that autophagy-blocking therapies limited virus-induced damage to intestinal barrier function, affirming the therapeutic relevance of autophagy manipulation to avert the intestinal permeability associated with acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 syndrome. Our findings underscore that SARS-CoV-2 exploits host autophagy machinery for intestinal dissemination and indicate that repurposed autophagy-based antivirals represent a pertinent therapeutic option to boost protection and ameliorate disease pathogenesis against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nSince December 2019, when the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first isolated in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has taken the world by storm. The collaborative and international scientific response to the resultant COVID-19 pandemic led to the rapid development of highly effective vaccines that have become the cornerstone of the global public health response to SARS-CoV-2. However, the effectiveness of these vaccines has been steadily threatened by emerging variants of concern (VOCs) that evade humoral responses from infection or vaccination [1\u20134]. The most recent variant of concern, the Omicron variant, was first detected in November 2021 and has replaced the earlier Alpha and Delta VOCs as the dominant global strain [5]. Currently, Omicron and its subvariants, including BA.5 sublineages, are the predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide [5]. As with previous VOCs, Omicron subvariants evade antibody responses elicited by vaccines or infection with earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants [4,6]. Additionally, clinically-approved monoclonal antibody treatments have reduced activity against Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, BA.4, BA.5, and currently circulating BQ.1.1 (derived from BA.5), and XBB1.5 (derived from BA.2) [2,3,7,8].\nCOVID-19 is a multi-organ disease, causing not only respiratory distress and failure, but also a wide range of extrapulmonary symptoms, with up to 17% of patients exhibiting gastrointestinal manifestations, such as nausea and abdominal pain [9,10]. Viral RNA or infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be isolated in stool samples from approximately 50% of COVID-19 patients and remains detectable long after respiratory symptoms subside [11\u201313]. Furthermore, studies using human intestinal organoid models have reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects the most abundant intestinal cell type, enterocytes, which produce large quantities of infectious SARS-CoV-2, thereby affirming the role of the gastrointestinal tract in virus dissemination and disease pathogenesis [9\u201311,14,15]. Thus, human pre-clinical studies are paramount to identify strategies to intervene in SARS-CoV-2 intestinal dissemination and lingering impairments associated with post-COVID-19 syndrome. In particular, host-directed therapeutics have great potential to offer increased protection against current and future emerging VOCs, since they are broad-spectrum and relatively impervious to the development of antiviral resistance [16\u201319]. Here, we aimed to enhance host mucosal immune defences, with a focus on the antiviral role of autophagy pathways, in order to identify host-directed antiviral strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is an intracellular lysosomal degradation mechanism that ultimately results in the breakdown of intracellular cargo including invading viruses. Specialized double-membrane vesicles coated with the canonical autophagy marker Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3), termed autophagosomes, sequester viruses or viral components. These virus-laden autophagosomes, including cytosolic cargo and host autophagy receptors, such as ubiquitin-binding protein p62 (p62, also known as sequestosome 1), are then targeted for lysosomal degradation. Notably, autophagy not only functions as an antiviral defence mechanism, but also represents a gatekeeper mechanism for intestinal homeostasis [20]. In the intestine, autophagy proteins are required for the secretory function of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and dysregulation of autophagy has been implicated in the severity of chronic inflammatory diseases of the bowel such as Crohn\u2019s disease [20]. In IECs, autophagy has been demonstrated to maintain cellular homeostasis and repair the intestine [21,22], supporting its essential role in intestinal barrier function upon cellular stress and infection.\nIt is widely acknowledged that positive-strand RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, can manipulate autophagy pathways [23\u201326]. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 stimulates the formation of RNA-replication organelles at double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), which structurally resemble autophagy vesicles and are also LC3+ in the case of mouse hepatitis coronavirus [25,27]. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved strategies to hijack acidic autophagy vesicles and membranes to promote their own replication. Furthermore, recent data have also demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 actively impairs autophagosome-lysosome fusion, thereby limiting the degradative activity of autophagy [23,24,28]. It has been hypothesized that the function of this virus-induced autophagy block is to prevent autophagy-mediated degradation of both virions and lipids that are necessary for DMV formation [25].\nMost recently, several peer-reviewed studies [6,29,30] have demonstrated that although SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants can use both the cell-surface routing and endosomal entry routes, BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants in particular, and to a lesser extent BA.5, preferentially utilize the latter in VeroE6, HEK-293T, and Calu3 human cell lines [6,29,30]. The endosomal virus entry route relies on an acidic intravesicular environment and cleavage by endosomal cathepsins to drive fusion with host intracellular membranes and escape into the cytoplasm, unlike the classical cell-surface Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)-mediated entry route favoured by the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 strain and the earlier Delta VOCs [6,29]. Notably, classical experimental inhibitors of autophagosome-lysosome fusion (i.e. inhibitors of autophagy flux) bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine potently block the entry of both Omicron BA.1 and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro, suggesting a particularly key role for autophagy pathways in supporting the replication of Omicron subvariants [29,30].\nPharmaceutical modulation of autophagy is already utilized for the treatment of non-infectious conditions, such as cancer [31], epilepsy [32], and neuroinflammation [33]. Recently, we have demonstrated the potential for clinically-approved autophagy-modulating drugs to limit intestinal HIV-1 acquisition and suppress ongoing HIV-1 replication in diverse cellular targets in human ex vivo tissue infection models, underlining host autophagy as a relevant target for antiviral therapies [17,34]. The intimate interplay between autophagy and endocytosis pathways in viral entry routes [35], alongside the manipulation of autophagy by SARS-CoV-2 [23\u201326], prompted us to investigate the potential of autophagy-targeting therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 dissemination.\nHere, we show that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the endosomal/autophagy entry route to infect intestinal epithelial cells, which is accompanied by loss of intestinal integrity. Notably, our data shows that a selection of autophagy-blocking drugs can suppress intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as prevent SARS-CoV-2-mediated disruption of the intestinal barrier. These findings underscore the therapeutic relevance of targeting host autophagy, and in particular autophagy mechanisms mediated by the host BCL2-Interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), to intervene in infections with emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.\n\n## Ethics statement\nFetal material was used as determined by Dutch law (Wet Foetal Weefsel), which states that human foetal tissues/cells can only be used for medical purposes, medical and scientific research, and medical and scientific education. Human foetal intestinal tissue samples (gestational age 17\u201318 weeks) were obtained from the HIS Mouse Facility of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam. All material has been collected from donors from whom written informed consent has been obtained for the use of the material for research purposes. The foetal donor information is anonymized and is not available to the Amsterdam UMC.\n\n## Intestinal epithelial monolayers\nHuman fetal intestinal organoids, for which generation and culture conditions are described in in supplementary materials M1, were used to generate human intestinal monolayers as described previously [36]. Briefly, 3.0\u2005\u00b5m pore 24-well transwell inserts (Corning) were coated with 20\u2005\u00b5g/mL rat collagen type 1 (Ibidi) in 0.1% acetic acid (Sigma Aldrich). Single cells were obtained from gut organoids using TrypLE (Gibco, Thermo Fischer Scientific) digestion and suspended in expansion medium \u2013 Intesticult human organoid growth medium (OGM; STEMCELL Technologies) components \u201cHuman Basal Medium\u201d and \u201cOrganoid Supplement\u201d in a 1:1 ratio supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (10 U/ml and 10\u2005\u03bcg/ml, respectively; Thermo Fisher Scientific) - supplemented with Y-27632 (STEMCELL Technologies), followed by seeding onto the collagen coated transwell inserts. For the first 7 days the monolayers were cultured in expansion medium. From day 7 onwards all monolayers were cultured in a differentiation medium (1:1 mixture of OGM component \u201cHuman Basal Medium\u201d and Advanced DMEM/F12; (Thermo Fisher Scientific)) supplemented with 10\u2005mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10\u2005mM HEPES (Sigma), and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and refreshed every 3\u20134 days. The integrity of the monolayer intestinal barrier was determined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurement using an Epithelial Volt/Ohm meter (EVOM2). TEER values (\u2126.cm2) were calculated as described in [37]. Monolayers were deemed sufficiently formed when the TEER was over 200 \u2126.cm2. The permeability of the intestinal epithelial monolayer was assessed using FITC-conjugated dextran (4\u2005kDa FD4, Sigma Aldrich) translocation assay from the apical to the basolateral compartment as described in supplementary materials M2. ACE2 expression in intestinal tissues was determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analyses as described in supplementary materials M3.\n\n## Cell lines\nThe Caco-2 cell line used in pseudovirus infection assays were a gift from Dr. Marta Bermejo Jambrina, Amsterdam UMC. The U87 cell line stably expressing CD4 and wild-type CCR5 co-receptor was obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: U87 CD4+CCR5+ cells, ARP-4035, contributed by Drs. HongKui Deng and Dan Littman [17,34,38]. Autophagy reporter cells were generated via retroviral transduction of U87.CD4.CCR5 with pBABE-mCherry-GFP-LC3 (Addgene 22418; gift from Prof. Jayanta Debnath [39]), as described previously [17,40], hereafter referred to as U87.LC3-mCherry-GFP cells. Culture conditions are described in supplementary materials M4.\n\n## Autophagy-modulating compounds\nCompounds utilized in this study to modulate autophagy were: berbamine dihydrochloride (Sigma 547190, \u201cBBM\u201d), Daurisoline (Sigma SML0597-5MG, \u201cDAS\u201d), and Bafilomycin A1 (Invivogen tlrl-baf1). DAS and Bafilomycin A1 stock were resuspended in sterile DMSO, and BBM in sterile water. Prior to the treatment of cell lines or primary cell culture, stocks were further diluted in cell culture medium. Cell viability upon drug treatment was measured as described in Supplementary materials M5.\n\n## Autophagy flux\nU87.LC3-mCherry-GFP cells were incubated with BBM (73.4\u2005\u03bcM), DAS (60\u2005\u03bcM), Bafilomycin A1 control (200 nM), or left untreated, for 24\u2005h. GFP and mCherry fluorescence was measured by multiparameter (FACS LSR-FORTESSA, BD Biosciences) and imaging flow cytometry analysis (ImageStream Mk II, Amnis) as previously described [40,41]. Reduction of GFP signal is representative of autophagy flux and was determined in live, singlet, mCherry+GFP+ U87.LC3-mCherry-GFP cells in untreated and drug-treated conditions. The control gate to determine autophagy flux was set in cells treated with bafilomycin A1 (200 nM) [17,40,41].\n\n## Intracellular p62 accumulation\nIntracellular p62 accumulation was measured in Caco-2 cells treated with BBM (36.7\u2005\u03bcM), or DAS (30\u2005\u03bcM), or left untreated, for 72\u2005h. Cells fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences) were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% saponin and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; both Sigma), followed by staining with either mouse anti-p62 (IgG2a, 5\u2005\u03bcg/mL, Abcam ab56416) or mouse IgG2a isotype control (5\u2005\u03bcg/mL, eBioscience 14-4724-85), and thereafter staining with goat anti-mouse IgG2a-Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen A11029). Intracellular p62 accumulation was quantified using flow cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences).\n\n## SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection assays\nSingle-round infection pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 (NL4.3-\u0394ENV-luc-GB-pseudo-SARS-CoV-2-Spike\u039421) was generated as described previously [42,43] and in Supplementary material M6. The SARS-CoV-2 spike plasmid HDM-IDTSpike-fixK-\u039421 was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Vector pHDM Containing the SARS-Related Coronavirus 2 Spike Glycoprotein Gene, D614G Mutant with C-Terminal Deletion, NR-53765. The adjusted HIV-1 backbone plasmid (pNL4-3.Luc.R-S-) containing previously described stabilizing mutations in the capsid protein (PMID:12547912) and a firefly luciferase gene in the nef open reading frame was provided by Dr. N.A. Kootstra (Amsterdam UMC).\nCaco-2 cells were cultured to approximately 80% confluency, or intestinal epithelial monolayers were cultured to TEER >200 \u2126.cm2 prior to overnight treatment with BBM (Caco-2: 14.7, 7.3, 3.7\u2005\u03bcM, or 1.8\u2005\u03bcM; organoid monolayers: 36.7\u2005\u03bcM), DAS (Caco-2: 60, 30, 15\u2005\u03bcM, or 7.5\u2005\u03bcM; organoid monolayers: 30\u2005\u03bcM), \u03b1-ACE2-antibody (R&D AF933) or isotype control (R&D AB-108-c), camostat mesylate (Sigma SML0057) or left untreated. Caco-2 or intestinal epithelial monolayers were then infected with 87.5\u2013350 plaque forming units (PFU) of NL4.3-\u0394ENV-luc-GB-pseudo-SARS-CoV-2-Spike\u039421. Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Britelite Plus Kit, Perkin Elmer cat #6066761) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n## Confocal microscopy\nIntestinal epithelial monolayers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences) for at least 30\u2005min at room temperature (RT), extensively washed with PBS. Membranes were then cut out of the insert and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X100 for 10\u2005min, and subsequently blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA with 0,5% Tween-20 for 1\u2005h at RT. Cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibody Mouse IgG1 anti-p24 (clone KC57, Beckman Coulter) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 3% BSA with 0,5% Tween-20, followed by secondary antibody Goat anti-Mouse IgG1 Alexa 647 diluted at 1:400 and the probe Phalloidin CruzFluorTM-488 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted at 1:1500 in PBS containing 3% BSA with 0,5% Tween-20 for 1\u2005h at RT. Nuclei were stained with 300nM DAPI (Invitrogen). Cells were subsequently mounted in Prolong Gold Diamond Antifade mountant (Invitrogen). Samples were imaged on a Leica TCSS SP8 X mounted on a Leica DMI6000 and analysed using LAS X. Quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity were performed by measuring the mean grey value with ImageJ software.\n\n## RNA interference\nRNA interference was performed using the Neon Transfection System according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Thermo Fisher). Caco-2 cells were transfected with different short interfering (si) SMARTpool RNAs (Dharmacon), namely siSNAP29 (M-011935-00), or siBNIP3 (M-004636-01), or siNon-Target as a control (D-001206-13) at end concentrations of 0.1\u2005\u00b5M siRNA per million of cells. Transfected cells, as well as non-transfected Caco-2 cells as an additional control, were seeded in 24-well plates in EMEM (ATCC #30-2003) with 8% FCS (Bio-connect), 2\u2005mM L-glutamine (Lonza), and 1x non-essential amino acids (SanBio SCC0823), without antibiotics. After 32\u2005h, adherent cells were washed and incubated overnight either with optimized concentrations of BBM (3.7\u2005\u03bcM) or left untreated. Silencing of expression of target proteins in Caco-2 cells was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure 1 or Supplementary Table 1).\n\n## SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 infection assays\nSARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 or BA.5 stocks were produced as described in supplementary materials M7 and diluted in cell-specific media to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. Caco-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 8,000 cells/well in 96-well plates the day before infection. Cells were pre-treated with compounds and then incubated with the virus, followed by fixation of the cells with 4% formalin in PBS for 30\u2005min. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10\u2005min and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1\u2005h at RT, followed by immunostaining with the mouse primary dsRNA antibody (J2-1904, Scicons English and Scientific Consulting) and rabbit primary SARS-CoV-2 antibody (HL344, Genetex GTX635679) at working dilutions of 1:1000 in 1% BSA in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:2000 dilution in 1% BSA in PBS and included the goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (A11001, Invitrogen) and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 555 (A21428, Invitrogen) with the nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 at 1.5\u2005\u00b5g/mL for 1\u2005h at RT. After washing with PBS, the plates were imaged on a high-content screening (HCS) platform (CellInsight CX7 HCS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 10X objective.\n\n## High-content screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection\nMonitoring of the total number of cells (based on nuclei staining) and the number of virus-infected cells (based on dsRNA or nucleocapsid staining) was performed using the CellInsight CX7 HCS platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as previously described [44,45]. Briefly, nuclei are identified and counted using the 350\u2044461\u2005nm wavelength (Hoechst 33342); cell debris and other particles are removed based on a size filter tool. A region of interest (ROI, or \u201ccircle\u201d) is then drawn around each host cell and validated against the bright field image to correspond with host cell membranes. The ROI encompasses the \u201cspots\u201d where dsRNA (485/521\u2005nm wavelength) or SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (549/600\u2005nm wavelength) are localized. Finally, the software (HCS Studio Cell Analysis Software, version 4.0) identifies, counts, and measures the pixel area and intensity of the \u201cspots\u201d within the \u201ccircle.\u201d The fluorescence measured within each cell (circle) is then added and quantified for each well. The total circle-spot intensity of each well corresponds to intracellular virus levels (Z\u2019\u2009>\u20090.7) and is normalized to noninfected cells and to infected cells with 1% DMSO. Nine fields were sampled from each well. Nuclei stain (Hoechst 33342) was also used to quantify cell loss (due to cytotoxicity or loss of adherence) and to verify that the changes in viral infection did not result from a decrease in cell numbers.\n\n## Median effective dose (EC\nIntracellular dose response (EC50 values) for BBM and camostat mesylate against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 and BA.5 was determined by pre-treating Caco-2 cells with serially diluted compound, followed by virus infection. Viral infection was detected by staining for dsRNA or nucleocapsid signal and quantified as described above. EC50 experiments were performed with two technical replicates in each experiment and EC50 experiments were repeated at least three times. Intracellular fluorescent levels were interpolated to a negative control (0.1% DMSO, no infection)\u2009=\u20090, and positive control (0.1% DMSO, with infection)\u2009=\u2009100.\n\n## Statistical analyses\nData were analyzed using FlowJo, LLC, version 10 (Treestar), IDEAS version 6.3 (Amnis), and/or GraphPad Prism 9\u2122 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). A two-tailed, parametric Student's t-test was performed for paired observations, and a two-tailed, unpaired t-test was performed for independent observations. For data shown in relative, data were normalized to untreated, virus infected samples (set at 1). A one-sample t-test was then utilized to compare fold changes in experimental conditions (drug-treated-virus infected samples) to the hypothetical population mean of 1, in line with [17]. The GraphPad Prism 9 nonlinear regression fit modelling variable slope was used to generate a dose\u2013response curve for EC50 values, [Y\u2009=\u2009Bottom + (Top\u2013Bottom)/(1\u2009+\u200910^((LogIC50-X)*HillSlope))], constrained to top\u2009=\u2009100, bottom\u2009=\u20090, as in [18]. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 and significance was set at *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P\u2009<\u20090.001.\n\n## SARS-CoV-2 infection of human intestinal epithelial monolayers is accompanied by loss of intestinal barrier integrity\nWe first confirmed that the obligate entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, ACE2, is expressed in both human intestinal tissues as well as in human-derived organoid models (Figure 1(A,B)). To monitor intestinal SARS-CoV-2 entry, we utilized our intestinal epithelial monolayer model [36,46], which in contrast to 3D intestinal organoid models readily permits access to the luminal (apical) and mucosal (basolateral) compartments, and thereby allows administration of viruses and antiviral drugs without the need for microinjection and in a manner that closely recapitulates in vivo intestinal architecture (Figure 1(C)). The integrity and paracellular permeability of intestinal epithelial monolayers were routinely monitored by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurement (with\u2009>\u2009200 \u03a9.cm2 indicative of a confluent monolayer; Figure 1(D)) and FITC-dextran permeation rate (Figure 1(E)), respectively. Permissiveness of intestinal epithelial monolayers to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus bearing the ancestral spike protein was validated by luminescence measurement (Figure 1(F)) as well as confocal imaging (Figure 1(G)), showing that this human intestinal epithelial monolayer model is suitable to monitor human intestinal SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Notably, entry of SARS-CoV-2 into intestinal epithelial cells resulted in disruption of monolayer barrier integrity 72\u2005h post-inoculation, as evident by distinct morphological changes of the intestinal epithelial cells and loss of cell\u2013cell contact, which were increasingly exacerbated over time (Figure 1(H)).\nFigure 1.SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infects human intestinal monolayers and disrupts intestinal barrier integrity.

We validated that a block of the ACE2 surface receptor or inhibition of TMPRSS2 surface serine protease via camostat mesylate decreased viral entry into epithelial cells, underpinning the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to utilize the TMPRSS2-dependent cell-surface entry route to establish infection of intestinal epithelial cells (Figure 2(B)). Autophagy is a regulator of intestinal homeostasis and functions as an antiviral defence mechanism by mediating lysosomal viral degradation [17,20,34]. To investigate the role of autophagy flux on SARS-CoV-2 entry of epithelial cells, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) technology to knock down the expression of autophagy molecule Synaptosomal-associated protein 29 (SNAP29), which is an adaptor molecule that links autophagosome-associated syntaxin 17 (STX17) with lysosomal vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8), thereby driving autophagosome-lysosome fusion [47]. Notably, the knockdown of SNAP29, which leads to a block in autophagy flux and reduced levels of acidic autophagy vesicles, resulted in decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to utilize not only the TMPRSS2-mediated cell-surface route, but an additional autophagy/endosomal route for viral entry in intestinal epithelial cells (Figures 2(B,C), Supplementary view figure 1, Supplementary view table 1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 readily infects human intestinal epithelial cells as well as compromises the intestinal barrier function. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 hijacks autophagy mechanisms to establish intestinal infection.\nFigure 2.SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus utilizes both the cell-surface entry route as well as the autophagy intracellular pathway to infect intestinal epithelial cells (A) Viral infection of Caco-2 cell line, determined by luciferase activity (RLU).

To this end, we have screened a panel of ten pre-clinical or clinically approved autophagy-blocking/inhibiting small molecules, based on the hypothesis that autophagy blockers could prevent SARS-CoV-2 interaction with cathepsins within acidic autophagy vesicles to impair SARS-CoV-2 entry via the endosomal route. The panel comprised of drugs targeting autophagosome-lysosome fusion or vesicle acidification in varying manners, such as disrupting proton gradient, blocking sodium-potassium ATPase function, or preventing fusion of lysosomes with other vesicles. Eight drugs did not pass a screening for robust impact on autophagy at non-toxic concentrations in human cells, thus we selected two drugs that were non-toxic in human intestinal organoid models: berbamine dihydrochloride (hereafter BBM) [47], and daurisoline (hereafter DAS) [48] (Figure 3(A,B)).\nFigure 3.Pharmacological modulation of autophagy prevents SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus acquisition by intestinal epithelial cells.
