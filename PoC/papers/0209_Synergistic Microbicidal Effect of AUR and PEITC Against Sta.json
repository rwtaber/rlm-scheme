  "title": "Synergistic Microbicidal Effect of AUR and PEITC Against Staphylococcus aureus Skin Infection.",
  "abstract": "Given the increasing prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to repurpose approved drugs with known pharmacology and toxicology as an alternative therapeutic strategy. We have reported that the sustained monotherapy of auranofin (AUR) inevitably resulted in reduced susceptibility or even the emergence of resistance to AUR in S. aureus. However, whether drug combination could increase antibacterial activity while preventing AUR resistance is still unknown. Here, we focused on the important role of AUR combined with phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) in skin infection and determined the synergistic antimicrobial effect on S. aureus by using checkerboard assays and time-kill kinetics analysis. This synergistic antimicrobial activity correlated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, disruption of bacterial cell structure, and inhibition of biofilm formation. We also showed that AUR synergized with PEITC effectively restored the susceptibility to AUR via regulating thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and rescued mice from subcutaneous abscesses through eliminating S. aureus pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Collectively, our study indicated that the AUR and PEITC combination had a synergistic antimicrobial impact on S. aureus in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that AUR and PEITC treatment may be a promising option for S. aureus infection.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nThe skin is the largest and most exposed organ system of the human body, colonized by a diverse microbiota that is dominated by members of the Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium genera (Grice and Segre, 2011; Byrd et\u00a0al., 2018; Parlet et\u00a0al., 2019). In the Staphylococcus genus, Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for most acute and chronic infections, and it is often included on lists of the most problematic pathogens. S. aureus also contributes to the pathogenesis of skin-associated diseases, and may cause aggravation of atopic dermatitis (AD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Sirobhushanam et\u00a0al., 2020; Cavalcante et\u00a0al., 2021). As the use of antibiotics has increased, the spread of resistant strains of S. aureus has become a public health crisis. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is one of the most prevalent antibiotic-resistant strains and accounts for 60% of clinically isolated S. aureus (Romaniuk and Cegelski, 2015). Clinical manifestation of MRSA infection ranges from skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) to severe invasive disease with high morbidity and mortality (Lee et\u00a0al., 2018). Even treatment with antibiotics like vancomycin and daptomycin, which are considered last\u2010resort antibiotics for MRSA infections, have become ineffective (Bayer et\u00a0al., 2013; McGuinness et\u00a0al., 2017). Moreover, the bacterial biofilm formation is a serious clinical issue, that represents enormous levels of antibiotic resistance. In samples of patients with chronic, non-healing cutaneous wounds, over half were shown to harbor biofilms (Ward et\u00a0al., 2015). Thus, there is a critical need for novel antimicrobial agents.\nTaking into account the discovery and development of new antimicrobial agents is characterized by high cost, long trial phases and low success rate, the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs is a very productive alternative method. Recently, metal compounds have been reported to have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, which exhibits the potential pharmacological value for this class of compounds (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2020). Auranofin (AUR), a gold-containing compound with phosphine and thiol ligands in alinear arrangement (\nFigure\u00a01\n), is prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 1985 (Glenn\u00e5s et\u00a0al., 1997). Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), part of the antioxidant thioredoxin (Trx) system, is essential for S. aureus growth (Uziel et\u00a0al., 2004; Harbut et\u00a0al., 2015). Previous findings have shown that AUR exhibits significant antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens by inhibiting TrxR and disrupting Trx-TrxR function to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, then eventually causing bacterial death (Feng et\u00a0al., 2021; Abutaleb and Seleem, 2020). However, our earlier studies demonstrated that sustained AUR monotherapy can induce TrxR gene (trxB) mutations at high dose, which probably lead to treatment resistance via reduction of the binding of metal cations to the active site cysteines of TrxR (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, antimicrobial combination are promising ways to solve this problem by achieving the desired therapeutic effect at a lower concentration and preventing the emergence of resistance.\nROS are implicated in bactericidal antibiotics that induce bacterial cell death (Kohanski et\u00a0al., 2007; Van Acker and Coenye, 2017). Current evidence suggests that all isothiocynates (ITCs) were found to cause oxidative stress and intracellular ROS generation (Pocasap et\u00a0al., 2018). Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), one of the most promising ITCs, is formed by enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosinolates present in cruciferous vegetables (\nFigure\u00a01\n) and has its unique biological features charactering as high bioavailability and can be rapidly absorbed (Lv et\u00a0al., 2020a). Studies have found that oral administration of PEITC has chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential against multiple cancers in human clinical trials (Gupta et\u00a0al., 2015; Lv et\u00a0al., 2020b). PEITC is recently shown to effectively inhibit various Gram-positive bacteria, but the exact mechanism has not been clearly elucidated (Jang et\u00a0al., 2010; Nowicki et\u00a0al., 2019). Collectively, both AUR and PEITC induce ROS accumulation and upset the redox balance, although their mechanistic pathways are different. These findings suggest that ROS generation could be a potential mechanism for cellular death caused by the combined action of AUR and PEITC.\nTo identify new therapies against S. aureus skin infections and define the mechanistic basis for their effects, we hypothesized that PEITC may increase the antimicrobial activity of AUR and prevent AUR resistance. In the present study, we report that AUR combined with PEITC has a synergistic antimicrobial effect against S. aureus infections in vitro and in vivo. By combining ROS assay, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and antibiofilm assay, we found that hydroxyl radical formation, bacterial cell membrane integrity disruption, and biofilm inhibition are key factors involved. Notably, AUR synergized with PEITC enhanced clearance of S. aureus in infection sites and rescued antimicrobial activity of AUR to suppress the development of resistance. This novel drug combination should be considered for future clinical study of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant S. aureus.\n\n## Bacterial Isolates, Drugs, and Mice\nS. aureus RN450, ATCC6538, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) USA300, and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) Mu50 were wild-type standard strains (Novick, 1967; Garrido et\u00a0al., 1982; Hiramatsu et\u00a0al., 1997; Diep et\u00a0al., 2006). The other three MRSA isolates, BN226, BN295, and BN508, were clinical wild-type pathogens. All clinical wild-type pathogens were isolated from the wound secretion of inpatients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. All isolates (from the Anhui Center for Surveillance of Bacterial Resistance-Huinet, Hefei, China) were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) broth medium (Solarbio, Shanghai, China) at 37\u00b0C. PEITC was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Auranofin was ordered from Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai). Other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All prepared solutions were stored at -20\u00b0C within 1 month. Wild-type BALB/c mice were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Anhui Province (Hefei, China). All experiments involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Anhui Medical University (Hefei, China).\n\n## Susceptibility Testing\nThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of AUR and PEITC were measured using the broth microdilution method, as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI], 2021). Overnight cultures were diluted 200-fold into fresh cation adjusted Muller Hinton Broth (CAMHB; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and grown to exponential phase OD600 ~0.3 (the optical density of growth cultures was measured at 600 nm) at ~5\u00d7108 CFU/mL, after which the cultures were diluted in broth to a final bacterial inoculum of 5\u00d7105 CFU/mL. Various amounts of the drugs were mixed and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. The MICs were defined as the lowest drug concentrations that inhibited visible bacteria growth.\n\n## Checkerboard Assays\nThe synergistic effect was evaluated using the microdilution checkerboard assay. In brief, bacteria were cultured in CAMHB overnight at constant rotation (220 rpm) at 37\u00b0C. The bacterial density was adjusted to a ~5\u00d7105 CFU/mL bacterial suspension and checked by CFU counting on agar plates. AUR, PEITC, or both drugs were added in triplicate to individual wells of a flat-bottomed 96-well plate and 2-fold serial dilution was performed, followed by the addition of prepared bacterial inoculum. The microwell plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight before reading. Wells with no drugs served as growth controls and wells with medium only served as background controls.\nThe fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated as follows: FICI = FICA + FICB = (MIC of drugA in combination/MIC of drugA alone) + (MIC of drugB in combination/MIC of drugB alone). Synergy was defined when FICI \u2264 0.5, indifference was defined when FICI > 0.5 and < 4, and antagonism was defined when FICI \u2265 4 (Sun et\u00a0al., 2020). All determinations were performed at least in triplicate on different days.\n\n## Time-Kill Studies\nTime-kill studies were conducted using AUR (1/2\u00d7MIC, 1\u00d7MIC, 2\u00d7MIC, and 4\u00d7MIC) in combination with PEITC (1\u00d7 MIC), as previously described (Chen et\u00a0al., 2021). In brief, bacterial strains were cultivated overnight and diluted 1:200 in fresh broth at 37\u00b0C on a shaker for 3\u00a0h to reach log phase. They were then prepared for MIC determination and treated with AUR, PEITC, or both. Samples and untreated cultures were removed at various times after 10\u2013105 fold dilutions with saline. The diluted samples were aseptically placed (10 \u00b5L) on agar plates incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight to measure the viable colony cell counts (CFU/mL). Controls (untreated) were set for each experiment. All assays were performed in triplicate on different days.\n\n## RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, and Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) of Gene Expression\nPretreated cultures were incubated overnight and diluted 100-fold in fresh broth for the OD600 of ~0.3 (log-phase) on a shaker at 37\u00b0C. The cell wells of S. aureus were then lysed using lysozyme (20 mg/mL) and lysostaphin (200 U/mL) for 3\u00a0h. RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) by strictly following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For reverse transcription, cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScript cDNA synthesis kit (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan). Trx and TrxR genes (trxA and trxB) were detected by a three-step real-time PCR system (Light Cycler 96; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Primers for qRT-PCR are listed in \nTable S1\n. Fold changes in trxB and trxA expression levels were normalized to the 16S rRNA internal control and determined by the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394CT calculation method. Reactions were run in triplicate.\n\n## ROS Assay\nThe fluorescent probe, carboxy-H2DCFDA (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), was used to measure intracellular ROS accumulation. Bacterial fluorescence intensity was analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter CyAn ADP analyzer; Brea, CA, USA) (Bass et\u00a0al., 1983; Chen et\u00a0al., 2021). Exponentially growing cultures (RN450 and USA300) were treated with AUR (4\u00d7MIC) alone, PEITC (1\u00d7MIC) alone, or in combination for 4\u00a0h. Carboxy-H2DCFDA was added to the treated or untreated samples at a final concentration of 10 \u00b5M to detect intracellular ROS levels. Samples (200 \u00b5L) were washed twice with precooled 1\u00d7 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to scavenge the agents and concentrated by centrifugation at 4600 xg for 2\u00a0min. A total of 100,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.\nThe fluorescent reporter dye, 3\u2019-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF; Thermo Fisher, USA), which was oxidized by hydroxyl radicals with high specificity, was used (Wang et\u00a0al., 2014). A suitably diluted stock solution of the dye (final HPF concentration, 5 \u03bcM) was added to treated or untreated cultures. Fluorescence (excitation, 490; emission, 515 nm) was measured using a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland). Cultures treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which induces hydroxyl radicals, were used as a positive control.\nWe next determined whether ROS (peroxide)-mediated rapid killing is a key factor for the AUR-PEITC drug combination. Exogenous addition of an effective ROS scavenger, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), mitigates ROS accumulation. Cultures were treated and placed on agar plates containing DMSO (5%, v/v), as in the previously described time-kill experiment. Growth kinetics was also studied in DMSO alone (Supplementary Data).\n\n## Cellular Morphology Study\nTo visualize any effect that the AUR-PEITC drug combination had on the growth and morphology of S. aureus, each strain was treated in the presence of AUR, PEITC alone, or together, or in broth as a positive growth control for 8\u00a0h. In brief, the cell suspension was washed three times in 1 mL of PBS. The bacterial pellets were then resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and fixed for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C. The slides were washed twice by immersion in 1\u00d7PBS for 10\u2009min and then dried by stepwise placement in graded ethanol solutions (10, 25, 40, 60, 75, and 90%) for approximately 10\u2009min or until completely dried. The samples were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).\n\n## Crystal Violet Biofilm Assay\nBiofilm inhibitory effect was measured using crystal violet as previously described (Xiao et\u00a0al., 2021). Briefly, overnight cultures were standardized to exponential phase OD600 ~0.3, and then diluted (1:100) with fresh broth. Samples (200 \u03bcL) were loaded into individual wells of 96-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. The medium was discarded, and the wells were washed three times with PBS. Next, the bacterial biofilms were fixed with 95% formalin for 15\u00a0min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for 20\u00a0min. Then, the excess stain was removed by washing twice with PBS, the stained biofilms were dried for 1\u00a0h and extracted with 33% glacial acetic acid. The amount of biofilm produced was quantified by measuring the optical density at 590 nm using a Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland). The percentage of biofilm eradication and inhibition was determined according to the following equation:\nThe rate of biofilm eradication/inhibition (%) = (1 \u2013 ODtest/ODcontrol) \u00d7 100%\n\n## Murine Skin Infection Model\nMurine S. aureus skin infection models were generated as previously described to evaluate the effect of combined AUR and PEITC treatment on antibacterial activity in vivo (Xiao et\u00a0al., 2021). The mice were anesthetized and the hair on the upper back of each mouse (approximately 2\u00d72 cm2) was shaved off 24\u00a0h before modeling. Cultures were prepared by resuspending at a density of 1\u00d71010 CFU/mL. Eight-week-old BALB/c mice (eight per group) were anesthetized with isoflurane and injected in the back subcutaneously with 50 \u03bcL of the bacterial cell suspension. After infection for 24\u00a0h, sterile 1\u00d7 PBS, 1% AUR alone, 10 \u03bcM PEITC alone, or the AUR-PEITC combination was injected subcutaneously into the abscess site, and then the wounds were observed every two days (Mohammad et\u00a0al., 2020; Osipitan et\u00a0al., 2021).\nAfter 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 days of therapy, the abscesses were imaged, and the weights and survival of mice were recorded to monitor the wound-healing process. The infected skin was assessed using Image J software. Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation at 8 days post-treatment. To determine bacterial density, samples of the abscess tissues were homogenized in 1 mL PBS and transferred into a sterile test tube for serial dilution. Viable counting was performed by culturing 100 \u03bcL tissue samples in broth agar and incubating them overnight at 37\u00b0C. A blank control (no treatment, PBS) group was set for each experiment. Statistical significance for bacterial killing in different treatment groups was calculated using one-way ANOVA and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons (Tukey\u2019s HSD).\n\n## Statistical Analysis\nData represent the means from three independent experiments, and error bars represent standard errors of the means. All statistical analyses were performed using unpaired Student t tests for two groups and one- or two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for multiple groups, with all data points showing a normal distribution. The results were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. All graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), FlowJo version 10.4 (Ashland, OR, USA), and Adobe Illustrator CC 2018 (Adobe Systems Inc., USA).\n\n## Antimicrobial Susceptibility of AUR and PEITC\nAUR and PEITC were tested on various S. aureus strains, including those resistant to conventional antimicrobials such as methicillin and vancomycin. As shown in \nTable\u00a01\n, the MIC values for all test strains were 0.125 or 0.25 \u03bcg/mL for AUR and 20 or 40 \u03bcg/mL for PEITC. AUR and PEITC MIC values were similar for all the antibiotic-sensitive S. aureus, MRSA, and VRSA pathogens. All strains were more sensitive to AUR than PEITC treatment.\n\n## The Synergistic Effect of AUR and PEITC Against \nThe synergistic effect of AUR in combination with PEITC was tested using checkerboard assays (\nTable\u00a01\n). For antibiotic-sensitive S. aureus, the MIC value of AUR was reduced by 8-fold in the presence of (1/4\u00d7MIC) PEITC against S. aureus RN450 (\nFigure\u00a02A\n), and the FICI was estimated to be 0.375, indicating that drug synergy had occurred (FICI \u2264 0.5, \nFigure\u00a02F\n). Treatment of ATCC6538 gave the same results (\nFigure\u00a02B\n). Importantly, PEITC sensitized the MRSA USA300 isolate to AUR by 8 fold, with dropping the PEITC MIC values from 40 \u03bcg/mL to 10 \u03bcg/mL (FICI= 0.375, \nFigures\u00a02C\u2013F\n), and the MRSA BN226 isolate to AUR by 8 fold, with dropping the MIC values of PEITC from 40 \u03bcg/mL to 5 \u03bcg/mL (FICI= 0.25, \nFigures\u00a02D\u2013F\n). Synergistic interactions were also observed against the MRSA clinical isolates, BN295 (FICI= 0.3125) and BN508 (FICI= 0.375) (\nSupplementary Figure S1\n). The combination of AUR and PEITC still showed typical synergism with a FICI of 0.375 for VRSA Mu50 (\nFigures\u00a02E, F\n).\n\n## PEITC Enhances AUR-Mediated Killing \nWe next examined whether PEITC could enhance the antimicrobial activity of AUR against S. aureus strains by using time-kill assays. PEITC in combination with various concentrations of AUR was used to treat S. aureus RN450 (\nFigure S2A\n). In the presence of 20 \u03bcg/mL PEITC, 4\u00d7, 2\u00d7, 1\u00d7, and 1/2\u00d7MIC AUR showed strong, moderate, low, and almost no killing of S. aureus, respectively. Thus, 4-fold MIC AUR was used to test the synergistic killing against other S. aureus pathogens. AUR (4\u00d7MIC) and PEITC combined treatment resulted in strong ~3.1 log10 CFU/mL killing of S. aureus RN450 (\nFigure\u00a03A\n), ~2.8 log10 CFU/mL killing of S. aureus ATCC6538 (\nFigure\u00a03B\n), and ~2.9 log10 CFU/mL killing of MRSA USA300 (\nFigure\u00a03C\n) within 24\u00a0h. AUR-mediated lethality was also significantly enhanced when used with PEITC, and bacterial counts were at least 2.6 log10 CFU/mL lower for the three clinical MRSA pathogens than after AUR monotherapy \n(Figures\u00a03D\u2013F\n). Similar synergistic killing was observed for VRSA Mu50 (\nFigure S2B\n). PEITC alone had no effect on bacterial growth (\nFigure\u00a03\n).\n\n## PEITC Restores Susceptibility to AUR \nTo assess the reversal of resistance to AUR by PEITC, AUR susceptibility studies were conducted using AUR (8\u00d7MIC) alone or with PEITC (20 \u03bcg/mL). Fold changes to the MICs of AUR after 96\u00a0h coincubation are shown in \nTable\u00a02\n. Addition of PEITC restored the susceptibility of all tested strains to AUR (within 2-fold of initial MICs) at 96\u00a0h. Similar results were also observed in the untreated group. However, AUR alone resulted in a 16- to 64-fold increase in the MICs.\nAs previously mentioned, TrxR, the S. aureus target for AUR, is importance in maintaining systemic redox homeostasis. Thus, qRT-PCR was used to analyze expression of genes (trxA and trxB) encoding the antioxidant thioredoxin (Trx-TrxR) system for untreated or treated S. aureus RN450 as described above (\nFigure\u00a04\n). By 96\u00a0h incubation of AUR monotherapy with high doses, the suppressing effect of AUR on trxB disappeared (\nFigure\u00a04B\n). Not only that, the slight increase was observed in trxB gene expression, but this was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). In contrast, expression of trxB was significantly down-regulation after AUR-PEITC combination treatment (P < 0.01). However, trxA expression levels were no significant difference (P > 0.05) between AUR with and without PEITC (\nFigure\u00a04A\n). Likewise, no alterations with PEITC monotherapy. On the basis of these data, we concluded that PEITC plays an important role in blocking AUR resistance.\n\n## AUR-PEITC Combination Stimulates ROS Production\nSince both AUR and PEITC can influence the redox balance in bacteria, we explored whether PEITC increases AUR-stimulated ROS accumulation. Intracellular ROS levels were measured with carboxy-H2DCFDA in S. aureus RN450 and MRSA USA300. AUR alone had a weak effect on fluorescence levels, but comparative analysis showed that AUR in combination with PEITC significantly increased ROS accumulation for RN450 (\nFigure\u00a05A\n) and UAS300 (\nFigure\u00a05B\n). HFP was used to verify the combined effect of AUR and PEITC on hydroxyl radical formation. Similarly, significantly increases were observed in ROS levels for RN450 (\nFigure\u00a05C\n) and USA300 (\nFigure\u00a05D\n).\nWe next examined combined AUR and PEITC treatment for its effect on ROS-mediated programmed cell death. As with the time-killing results, synergistic killing was observed following combined PEITC and AUR treatment of S. aureus RN450 (\nFigure\u00a05E\n) and MRSA USA300 (\nFigure\u00a05F\n). However, adding 5% DMSO sharply diminished this combination-mediated synergistic killing against RN450 (increased by 4.1 log10 CFU/mL killing; P < 0.01) (\nFigure\u00a05E\n), and against USA300 (increased by 3.6 log10 CFU/mL killing; P < 0.01) (\nFigure\u00a05F\n). At this concentration, DMSO alone did not affect bacterial growth within 24\u00a0h (P > 0.05; \nFigure S3\n). Taken together, these data indicate that AUR and PEITC treatment causes strong killing by increasing intracellular ROS levels.\n\n## Combined AUR and PEITC Treatment Exacerbates Morphological Damage\nSEM experiments were performed to study morphological changes of S. aureus RN450, MRSA USA300, and VRSA Mu50 following treatment with AUR, PEITC, or both. Images showed that the RN450 and USA300 cell walls were intact in the absence of treatment and in response to PEITC monotherapy. AUR monotherapy caused some small ruptures on the cell walls. However, RN450 and USA300 treated with the AUR and PEITC combination both showed large-scale membrane disruptions with cratering, some cell lysis, extruded cell debris, and clumped structures (\nFigure\u00a06A\n). The Mu50 cell surface was also extensively damaged and showed cell lysis in response to combination treatment (\nFigure S4\n).\n\n## AUR Synergized With PEITC Against Biofilms Formation\nWe tested efficacy of the AUR and PEITC combination in eradicating established biofilms using S. aureus RN450 as a model. AUR monotherapy exhibited moderate biofilm inhibitory effects against RN450 in a dose-dependent manner, 21.1% of the biofilm was eradicated at 1/2\u00d7MIC AUR, 45.6% of the biofilm was eradicated at 1\u00d7MIC AUR, 75.6% of the biofilm was eradicated at 2\u00d7MIC AUR and 81.8% of the biofilm was eradicated at 4\u00d7MIC AUR compared to controls, respectively (\nFigures\u00a06B, C\n). Obviously, the best inhibitory effect was observed when PEITC combined with AUR. The biofilm inhibition rates were 91.5% for PEITC combined with 2\u00d7MIC AUR, 95.1% for PEITC combined with 4\u00d7MIC AUR, indicating that this combination showed strong biofilm inhibitory effects against RN450 at 24\u00a0h compared to AUR monotherapy (\nFigures\u00a06B, C\n; P < 0.01). As with our results, such inhibition was absent in PEITC alone. These findings strongly supported the high efficacy of AUR and PEITC combination by interfering with biofilm formation.\n\n## AUR-Induced Protection Against Skin Infections Is Enhanced in the Presence of PEITC\nTo definitively assess the antibacterial effects of AUR and PEITC in vivo, mouse models of subcutaneous abscess induced by S. aureus RN450 and MRSA USA300 were established (\nFigure\u00a07A\n). USA300 is of particular concern given that this isolate has been linked to the majority of SSTIs in the USA (Stryjewski and Chambers, 2008). Successfully infected mice were divided into four groups and treated with PBS (control), AUR, PEITC, or both drugs together. As shown in \nFigure\u00a07\n, we evaluated bacterial loads in the abscessed skin from each treatment group on the eighth day of treatment. Consistent with our in vitro results, AUR monotherapy showed antimicrobial activity against the infected bacteria but there was a sharp reduction in the burden of RN450 in response to AUR and PEITC together (\nFigure\u00a07B\n). Similarly, a significant reduction in bacterial load was found in USA300-induced skin infections (\nFigure\u00a07C\n).\nFollowing treatment and lasted for 12 days, body weight (\nFigure S5\n) and survival rates (data not shown) were recorded every other day, but no significant differences were shown between the treatment groups for RN450 and USA300 (P > 0.05). To further verify the influence of combination therapy on subcutaneous abscess, the size of the infected skin area was measured after S. aureus challenge. As expected, the wound area of mice treated with the AUR and PEITC combination became significantly smaller, the skin healed well, and no obvious scars or ulceration were seen within 12 days as compared to AUR monotherapy against RN450 (\nFigures\u00a07D\u2013F\n; P < 0.01). AUR and PEITC treatment also resulted in a significantly smaller abscess area than AUR alone against USA300, with wounds that healed faster, and skin that grew back at an accelerated pace, leading to eventual loss of the abscess (\nFigures\u00a07E\u2013G\n; P < 0.01). These important observations reveal that AUR monotherapy is often inadequate when S. aureus forms high-density infections. AUR and PEITC together significantly improved treatment efficacy.\n\n## Discussion\nS. aureus is one of the most persistent bacterial pathogens with serious diseases, ranging from minor to life-threatening infections (Nowicka and Grywalska, 2019). S. aureus-induced SSTIs are common among patients seeking inpatient and outpatient medical care (Dayan et\u00a0al., 2016; Inagaki et\u00a0al., 2019), and recurrent infections are reported in nearly half of cases (Montgomery et\u00a0al., 2015). While the incidence of MRSA in hospitalized patients has declined, the emergence of community-acquired MRSA poses a new challenge (Calfee, 2017). This has necessitated the development of effective antimicrobial agents against S. aureus. Combination treatment is a promising way to improve efficacy and reduce side effects and cytotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of using AUR and PEITC to treat skin infections both in vitro and in vivo, and elucidated the mechanism of this treatment approach.\nPrevious studies found that AUR exhibits antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Aguinagalde et\u00a0al., 2015; Tharmalingam et\u00a0al., 2019). Here, we reported that AUR combined with PEITC increased the antimicrobial susceptibility of S. aureus pathogens to AUR by 8-fold. Remarkably, combination therapy resulted in the synergistic killing of antibiotic susceptible S. aureus and MRSA, including clinically isolated MRSA. These data strongly suggest that PEITC can enhance AUR-mediated protection against MRSA strains in vitro. Likewise, AUR in combination with PEITC also displayed a significant synergistic effect for VRSA Mu50, suggesting that combination treatment has antimicrobial activity against both susceptible and resistant S. aureus phenotypes. Our findings may also imply that the mechanism of action of AUR and PEITC is unique from any used antibiotics. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism(s) of action of this drug combination against S. aureus pathogens.\nDuring prolonged incubation with high AUR concentrations, we showed the considerably increase in its MIC value for all tested S. aureus isolates, which may accelerate the emergence of AUR-resistant bacterial strains. Consistent with our previous study, this probably occurred because trxB mutation results in loss of the primary target of AUR (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020). However, no noticeable alterations to AUR MICs were observed when alongside PEITC. Further studies are needed to determine whether the presence of PEITC recover the inhibitory effect of AUR on the TrxR. This observation raises the possibility that PEITC could potentially regulate the redox balance through the expression of trxB in S. aureus. Notably, there is no results regarding its effect on Trx gene (trxA). Thus, as a better choice for treatment than AUR alone, the AUR and PEITC combination could aggravate destruction of the Trx-TrxR system, and cause subsequent bacterial death. However, the underlying mechanism of the synergistic antimicrobial activity of AUR combined with PEITC remains uncertain.\nAUR can compromise the thiol-redox system to increase ROS levels (Harbut et\u00a0al., 2015; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2020). Consistent with these results, an obvious increase in ROS production was observed after treatment with AUR alone. However, in the absence of additional oxidative stress, bacteria can still maintain redox homeostasis by utilizing available cellular antioxidants, which may explain the bacteria regrowth observed after AUR monotherapy at 24\u00a0h. Meanwhile, ROS are also recognized as critical for cell death by PEITC (Lv et\u00a0al., 2020b). However, we did not observe changes in ROS generation with PEITC alone, which may be due to the fact that lower concentrations were used in this study. It was recently proposed that fenton-mediated hydroxyl radical formation is a common mechanism in bacterial cell death; however, the contribution of ROS to bacterial killing remains controversial (Van Acker and Coenye., 2017; Keren et\u00a0al., 2013). Based on the data, we obtained in the current study, together with data published by other groups, we proposed that synergistic antimicrobial activity induced by AUR and PEITC was linked to ROS accumulation. Not surprisingly, AUR and PEITC greatly enhanced intracellular ROS levels. This also shows that in the presence of additional oxidative stress, such as ROS production induced by PEITC, bacterial cells can no longer maintain their redox balance, allowing oxidative damage to occur. Results from this study showed that DMSO is a scavenger of ROS, reducing the bacterial killing ca",
