  "title": "Cordycepin affects Streptococcus mutans biofilm and interferes with its metabolism.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) contributes to caries. The biofilm formed by S. mutans exhibits greater resistance to drugs and host immune defenses than the planktonic form of the bacteria. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-biofilm effect of cordycepin from the perspective of metabolomics. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of cordycepin on planktonic S. mutans. The 24-h biofilm was treated with 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of cordycepin for 10\u00a0min at the 8- or 20-h time points. Biofilm biomass and metabolism were assessed using crystal violet and MTT assays and cordycepin cytotoxicity was evaluated in human oral keratinocytes (HOK) using CCK-8 assays. The live bacterial rate and the biofilm volume were assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Metabolic changes in the biofilm collected at different times during with cordycepin were analyzed by metabolomics and verified by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The results showed that treatment with 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL cordycepin reduced both the biomass and metabolic activity of the biofilm without killing the bacteria, and cordycepin at this concentration showed good biocompatibility. Metabolomics analysis showed that differentially abundant metabolites following cordycepin treatment were mainly related to purine and nucleotide metabolism. After immediate treatment with cordycepin, genes related to purine and nucleotide metabolism were downregulated, and the levels of various metabolites changed significantly. However, the effect was reversible. After continuing culture for 4\u00a0h, the changes in genes and most metabolites were reversed, although the levels of 2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxyinosine, and adenine remained significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Cordycepin has the effect of anti-biofilm of S. mutans, mainly related to purine and nucleotide metabolism.",

  "full_text": "## Backgroud\nDental caries is a common disease of the oral cavity. It is caused by bacterial infection that can lead to gradual deterioration of the hard tissue of the teeth and thus requires prompt treatment [1]. Common complications of caries include pulpitis, tooth loss, jaw inflammation, and even septicemia caused by unrestricted bacterial growth [2]. According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study, 2.3\u00a0billion individuals worldwide have caries in their permanent dentition and over 530\u00a0million children have caries in deciduous teeth [3]. It can be seen that the prevention and control of caries is both an important and urgent public health issue throughout the world.\nCaries is a multifactorial disease characterised by demineralisation of tooth structure caused by organic acids from biofilms [4, 5]. Biofilms are architectural communities of diverse microorganisms that are firmly attached to surfaces and embedded in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix composed of polymeric substances such as extracellular polysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids [6]. The extracellular matrix produced by specific microorganisms promotes microbial adhesion and cohesion and is essential for the expression of virulence of bacterial pathogens living in biofilms [7]. S. mutans is a major matrix producer and can rapidly modulate cariogenic biofilm formation when sucrose is present in the diet [8\u201310]. And it can metabolize carbon sources to produce acidic [11]. When the pH of the local micro-ecological environment of the tooth surface drops to 5.5, demineralization of the enamel can occur. However, S. mutans can tolerate acidic environments and still survive at pHs below 5.5, contributing to dentin demineralization and the formation of dental caries [12]. Bacteria within biofilms are more resistant to drugs and host immune defense than planktonic bacteria, and biofilms can also supply bacteria with abundant nutrients that promote their growth and reproduction, thus aggravating caries [13]. Therefore, regulation of the cariogenic effects of biofilm may be a method to prevent caries.\nThe isolation and screening of active ingredients from natural substances and studying their therapeutic mechanisms are current research hotspots in pharmacology. Cordycepin (formula: C10H13N5O3), also known as 3\u2019-deoxyadenosine [14], is a traditional monomeric Chinese medicine that is isolated from cordyceps fungi and has anti-tumor [15\u201317], anti-viral [18], anti-inflammatory [19, 20], and immunomodulatory [21, 22] properties. Cordycepin has been demonstrated to exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against 11 species of intestinal bacteria, including Escherichia coli, and eight species of lactobacilli [23]. Other studies have indicated that cordycepin can also competitively inhibit the catalytic activity of bacterial adenosine kinase, which in turn inhibits adenosine phosphorylation, leading to the death of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [24]. Cordycepin also affects the structure and function of nucleic acids by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and binding to bacterial genomic DNA, ultimately leading to the death of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis [25]. Cordycepin has been shown to play a vital role in inhibiting and eradicating Candida albicans biofilms [26]. However, there is limited information on whether cordycepin inhibits S. mutans biofilms.\nIn addition, the development of antimicrobial treatments suitable for clinical application is also an important part of research. Toothpaste and mouthwash containing natural/herbal agents are widely used for treating oral diseases. Mouthwash is especially popular as it is convenient to use. Mouthwash has been shown to control biofilm formation to some extent by interfering with the metabolism of oral microorganisms [27, 28]. Metabolomics is a technology that mainly investigates spatiotemporal variations in landscapes of low molecular-weight metabolites resulting from different stimuli and treatments, thus providing insight into the metabolic regulation of biological systems [29].\nIn our previous study, it was found that the treatment of biofilm samples with 1.5% arginine twice daily (at 8\u00a0h and 20\u00a0h time points, 10\u00a0min per time) was better able to simulate the environment in which someone might use mouthwash twice per day. In addition, 1.5% arginine in this treatment mode can significantly reduce the biomass of S. mutans biofilm [30]. To date, there have been no investigations into the effect of cordycepin on S. mutans biofilm. Therefore, this study referred to the treatment mode of 1.5% arginine to evaluate the anti-biofilm effects of cordycepin and determine the effects of cordycepin from the perspective of metabolomics.\n\n## Bacterial species and growth conditions\nS. mutans UA159 (ATCC 700610) was cultured overnight in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (HuanKai Microbial, Guangdong, China) in an incubator at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with 5% CO2.\n\n## Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cordycepin\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cordycepin against S. mutans was determined using a microdilution method, as described by Cai et al. [31]. Cordycepin (BENCAOYIKANG, YK220110, China) was dissolved in sterile water and double-diluted to varying concentrations (8,192, 4,096, 2,048, 1,024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) with sterile water before use. 100 \u00b5L of the bacterial suspension diluted with two-fold concentration of BHI and 100 \u00b5L cordycepin were inoculated into each well of a 96-well round-bottomed plate (Corning, 3799, USA), resulting in a final bacterial count of 106 colony forming units (CFU) mL\u2212\u20091. The final concentrations of cordycepin were 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024, 2,048, and 4,096\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. The equivalent volumes of sterile water were used as control. The bacterial samples were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h and absorbances at 600\u00a0nm were then measured using a spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific 1530, Waltham, MA, USA). Each experiment was performed with triplicate samples at each time point. The results correspond to three experiments independently.\n\n## Assessment of biofilm biomass\nCrystal violet assays were used to evaluate the biomass of the biofilm [32]. BHI with 1% sucrose (1% BHIS) adjusted the bacteria to 107 CFU mL\u2212\u20091 [33] and these bacterial suspensions were inoculated in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Corning, 3599) at 200\u00a0\u00b5l per well and cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C under 5% CO2 to let the bacteria build a biofilm. At both the 8- and 20-h time points, the biofilm was treated with 200 \u00b5L of different concentrations of cordycepin (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024, 2,048 and 4,096\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) (10\u00a0min per treatment). The medium was replaced with fresh 1% BHIS after each treatment. After the second treatment, the biofilm was allowed to grow until the 24-h time point. The biofilms were stained for 15\u00a0min with 0.1% crystal violet (100 \u00b5L/well) and washed twice with sterile water. The excess crystal violet solution was removed, the wells were washed twice with sterile water, and the bound crystal violet was dissolved by adding 100 \u00b5L of 100% ethanol. After transferring a 100 \u00b5L volume of each sample into a new 96-well plate, the absorbances of the samples were read at 570\u00a0nm with a spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific 1530). Sterile water and 1.5% arginine were used as the negative and positive control, respectively. Each experiment was performed with triplicate samples at each time point. The results correspond to three experiments independently.\n\n## Cytotoxicity assays\nHuman oral keratinocytes (HOK) (GuangZhou Jennio Biotech company, China) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of cordycepin in vitro using CCK-8 assays [34]. HOK cells were cultured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco, 1095500BT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonsera, S711-001\u00a0S, Uruguay). The HOK cells (5000 cell/100 \u00b5L/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and grown for 24\u00a0h, after which they were treated with medium with or without cordycepin (128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) for 24\u00a0h. After incubation, 10 \u00b5L of CCK-8 solution (Beyotime, C0038, China) was added to each well and the plate was incubated in a CO2 incubator for 3\u00a0h. The absorbances of the samples were measured at 450\u00a0nm against a blank which contained medium only. Cell viability (%) = (OD of sample - OD of blank)/(OD of control -OD of blank) \u00d7 100%. Each experiment was performed with triplicate samples at each time point. The results correspond to three experiments independently.\n\n## MTT metabolic assay\nThe metabolic activity of the bacteria was determined by 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2\u00a0H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich, M2128, USA) assay, as previously described [35]. As described in 2.3, the 24-h biofilm was treated with sterile water or 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of cordycepin for 10\u00a0min at the 8- or 20-h time points. 50 \u00b5L of 0.5\u00a0mg/mL MTT solution in PBS were added to the biofilms in 96-well plates. After 1-h incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, the wells were washed twice with 150 \u00b5L PBS, after which 150 \u00b5L of DMSO (Beyotime, ST038, China) was added to the wells. After 10\u00a0min on an orbital shaker, the absorbances of the samples were measured at 570\u00a0nm with a spectrophotometer. Metabolic activity of biofilms (%) = (OD of sample - OD of blank)/(OD of control -OD of blank) \u00d7 100%. Each experiment was performed with triplicate samples at each time point. The results correspond to three experiments independently.\n\n## Analysis of the live bacterial rate and the volume of biofilm by confocal laser-scanning microscopy\nCell samples (2,000 \u00b5L, 107 CFU mL\u2212\u20091 in fresh 1% BHIS) were added to confocal culture dishes (NEST, 801002, USA). As described in 2.3, the 24-h biofilm was treated with sterile water or 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of cordycepin for 10\u00a0min at the 8- and 20-h time points. After three washes with 0.9% saline, bacterial cells were stained using a LIVE/DEADTM BacLight\u2122 Bacterial Viability Kit (Thermo Fisher, L13152). After three washes with 0.9% saline to remove dye, the bacteria were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Olympus, FV-1200MPE SHARE, Japan), with live bacteria staining green (excitation channel was set to 488\u00a0nm), and dead bacteria staining red (excitation channel was set to 543\u00a0nm). Triplicate samples were used, and three randomly selected fields in each sample were examined. This experiment was repeated three times independently. The rate of live bacteria and the biofilm volume were calculated using IMARIS software.\n\n## Metabolite extraction\nEach well of a flat-bottomed 24-well plate was inoculated with 1,000 \u00b5L of cell sample (107 CFU mL\u2212\u20091 in fresh 1% BHIS). As described in 2.3, the biofilm was treated with sterile water (Control-24\u00a0h) or 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of cordycepin (Exp-24\u00a0h) for 10\u00a0min at the 8- and 20-h time points. After the second treatment, the biofilm culture was continued for another 4\u00a0h before collection. Biofilm samples were also collected at the 20-h point following the second cordycepin treatment (Exp-20\u00a0h). Metabolite extraction, detection, and analysis were performed at Wuhan Metware Biotechnology (Wuhan, China), where the samples had been sent on dry ice.\nOne hundred microliter samples of biofilm were mixed with 300 \u00b5L of methanol for 1\u00a0min. The samples were then homogenized using a TissueLyser (Jingxin Company, Shanghai) for 5\u00a0min at 50\u00a0Hz. After being frozen for 2\u00a0h at \u2212\u200920\u00a0\u00b0C, the samples were centrifuged at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min at 25,000\u00a0g. This was followed by Liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LC-MS) analysis. Sextuplicate samples were used. Ten-microliter aliquots of supernatant were removed from each sample and incorporated into quality control (QC) samples to monitor the repeatability of the analysis process.\n\n## Metabolomics detection\nA 1290 Infinity ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Agilent, USA) with a Waters Acquity UPLC HSS T3 C18 column (100\u2009\u00d7\u20092.1\u00a0mm, 1.8\u00a0\u03bcm) was used for chromatographic separation. The column was maintained at 40\u00a0\u00b0C with a 2-\u00b5L injection volume for each sample and 0.4 mL/min flow rate. The mobile phases were (A) water and (B) acetonitrile both containing 0.1% formic acid (Thermo Fisher). The column was eluted with 5% mobile phase B and 95% mobile phase A, which was then followed by a linear gradient to 90% mobile phase B and 10% mobile phase A over 11\u00a0min, which was then held for 1\u00a0min before being brought back down to 5% mobile phase B and 95% mobile phase A within 0.1\u00a0min and then held for 1.9\u00a0min.\nA 6550 quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent) was operated in positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) electrospray ion modes. The ion source voltages for ESI\u2009+\u2009and ESI- modes were 2.5\u00a0kV and 1.5\u00a0kV, respectively. In ESI\u2009+\u2009and ESI- mode, both the gas and sheath temperature were set at 325 \u2103 and the gas and sheath flows were set at 8\u00a0L/min and 11\u00a0L/min, respectively. The nebulizer and fragmentation voltages were 40\u00a0V and 135\u00a0V, respectively.\n\n## Data processing and analysis methods\nProteoWizard was used to transform the original LC-MS data file into the mzML format. Peak extraction, peak alignment, and retention time correction were performed using XCMS software. The \u201cSVR\u201d technique was applied for adjustment of the peak area. Peaks with detection rates below 50% were eliminated from each set of samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by using the R \u201cprcomp\u201d function. PCA was used for the initial analysis of the separation between the samples of each group and determining whether there were differences within the sample groups, while the QC samples were monitored to determine whether the instrument was stable. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed using the \u201cMetaboAnalyst\u201d package in R. One of the most common applications of OPLS-DA, a form of supervised multivariate statistical analysis, is the identification of metabolites that are significantly different across sample groups. Moreover, 200-permutation tests were conducted to assess OPLS-DA model overfitting. The prediction parameters R2X, R2Y, and Q2 were calculated to evaluate the predictive ability and goodness-of-fit of the OPLS-DA model.\n\n## Selected differential metabolites\nThe variable importance in projection (VIP) based on the OPLS-DA model is a parameter that shows the importance of a variable in a model. Usually, a metabolite with VIP\u2009>\u20091 is considered to play an important role in distinguishing groups. The screening requirements for differential metabolites between the two groups included a fold-change (FC) value of at least 2.0 or \u2264\u20090.5, VIP of more than 1, and corrected P-values less than 0.05. Differential metabolites were selected for multi-group analysis if they matched the criteria of VIP\u2009>\u20091 and corrected P-value\u2009<\u20090.05 (one-way ANOVA).\n\n## Enrichment analysis and KEGG annotation\nThe identified differential metabolites were annotated using the KEGG compound database (www.kegg.jp), after which they were mapped using the KEGG Pathway database.\n\n## Quantitative real-time PCR\nNine genes (guaA, guaB, hprT, purA, purB, apt, deoD, punA, and add) found to be associated with the differential metabolites were selected for quantitative real-time PCR verification. The grouping and biofilm preparation time points used for this experiment were consistent with those used for the metabolomics analysis. Total RNA was extracted from three groups of biofilm samples using an miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR analysis were performed using the PrimeScript\u2122 RT reagent Kit (Takara Cat RR037A) and TB Green\u00ae Premix Ex Taq \u2122 II kit (Takara Cat RR820A), respectively. The amplification procedures were as follows: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s; 45 cycles of 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0s, and 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s. The sequences of the primers designed by Primer 3.0 software are shown in Table\u00a01, and 16\u00a0S rRNA was used as the endogenous control. The mRNA expression levels of related genes in the three groups were analyzed by the threshold cycle method (2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT). Each experiment was performed with triplicate samples at each time point. The results correspond to three experiments independently.\nTable 1Primer sequencesIDEncoded proteinPrimer sequences (5\u2019\u21923\u2019)guaA-Fguanosine monophosphate synthaseCACAGAAACAGCCCAAACCAguaA-RCAGGTCCTGGAAATGGTTGCguaB-Finosine monophosphate dehydrogenaseGCGGTCTTGGTGTTGTTCATguaB-RACGACCGGAACACCACTAATadd-Fadenosine deaminaseAGGCTTTGACTTTGCAGGAAadd-RATTCCGGATGGTCATGGATAdeoD-Fpurine-nucleoside phosphorylaseGCTTGGACAAATTGGGGTTAdeoD-RTAAAGGTTGTTTGGCGTTCCpunA-Fpurine-nucleoside phosphorylaseCCGGTCATGCTGGTAAACTTpunA-RCAGCCGCATTAGTGACGATAhprT-Fhypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferaseTCAAGTTACCATGGCGGAAChprT-RTCAACAACACGACCTTCTGGpurA-Fadenylosuccinate synthaseCCGAGTTGGTTGGTTTGACTpurA-RTTCGAGACTGGCAGGGTAGTpurB-Fadenylosuccinate lyaseATTATCGCGCCTGATACGACpurB-RCGGTTTGAAGTCCACTTGGTapt-Fadenine phosphoribosyl transferaseGAAGCGCGTGGTTTTATTGTapt-RCTGTGCCACCAGTTGCTAAA16s rRNA-F16s rRNA-RCTGACTTGAGTGCAGAAGGGGACGTCAGTGACAGACCAGAGAGC\n\n## Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The data were assessed to determine whether they were normally distributed. Normally distributed data were analyzed using t-tests, while Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare non-normally distributed data. Differences in the expression of nine genes between the Control-24\u00a0h, Exp-20\u00a0h, and EXP-24\u00a0h groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. If the variance was homogeneous, an LSD multiple comparison test was performed, while for non-homogenous variances, Tamhane\u2019s T2 multiple comparison test was used. For metabolome analysis, see 2.7.3 and 2.7.4 above. The level of statistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.\n\n## Effects of cordycepin on bacterial growth and biofilm and its cytotoxicity\nNo effective MIC was found within the set range (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1,024, 2,048, 4,096\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) (Fig.\u00a01A).\nFig. 1Cordycepin effects on bacterial and biofilm growth and its cytotoxicity (independent-samples t-test). (A) The growth of S. mutans after treatment with different concentrations of cordycepin for 24\u00a0h. Treatment groups were compared to control (n\u2009=\u20098). (B) biofilm biomass by S. mutans treated with different concentrations of cordycepin for 10\u00a0min two times (8\u00a0h and 20\u00a0h) were evaluated (n\u2009=\u20094). (C) Metabolic activity by S. mutans treated with 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL cordycepin for 10\u00a0min two times (8\u00a0h and 20\u00a0h) were evaluated. (D) Viability percentage of HOK cells treated with 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL cordycepin for 24\u00a0h. All values are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Black *, compared with Control (sterile water); orange *, compared with 1.5% arginine. *P\u2009<\u20090.05\nHowever, it was found that twice-daily treatment with a certain concentration of cordycepin effectively reduced the biofilm biomass. Although 32 and 64\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of cordycepin reduced biofilm biomass compared to sterile water (negative control), there was no significant difference compared to 1.5% arginine (positive control), so we chose the concentration of 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, which was significantly different compared to both negative and positive controls, for the subsequent experiments (Fig.\u00a01B).\nMTT assay was used to evaluate the metabolic activity of S. mutans biofilm. As shown in Fig.\u00a01C, the metabolic activity of the biofilm decreased to 75.452\u2009\u00b1\u20093.862% after 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL cordycepin treatment and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). This result indicates that cordycepin inhibited the metabolic activity of S. mutans to reduce the biomass of biofilm.\nThe cytotoxicity of cordycepin was evaluated by testing the viability of HOK cells. As shown in Fig.\u00a01D, treatment with 128\u00a0\u00b5g/ml cordycepin for 24\u00a0h had no significant effect on HOK cells (P\u2009=\u20090.916). Therefore, 128\u00a0\u00b5g/ml cordycepin was used for subsequent experiments.\n\n## Effect of cordycepin on the live bacterial rate and volume of S. mutans biofilm\nPlanar and 3D images of biofilm were obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy and the live bacterial rate and the volume of S. mutans biofilm were analyzed. The green color of image was for live bacteria, red color was for dead bacteria. In the absence of cordycepin, the biofilm structure was relatively dense and substantial, while after cordycepin treatment, the structure appeared looser and more dispersed (Fig.\u00a02A). Meanwhile, the biofilm volume decreased, changing from (1.447\u2009\u00b1\u20090.117\u2009\u00d7\u2009108) \u00b5m3 to (1.233\u2009\u00b1\u20090.084\u2009\u00d7\u2009108), with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) (Fig.\u00a02B). However, the live bacterial rate did not change significantly after cordycepin treatment (P\u2009=\u20090.551) (Fig.\u00a02C), indicating that cordycepin did not reduce the biomass of the biofilm by killing bacteria.\nFig. 2Effect of cordycepin on live/dead bacteria and volume of the biofilm of S. mutans (independent-samples t-test). (A) Live/ dead bacteria staining of S. mutans biofilm. The green color of image was for live bacteria, red color was for dead bacteria, merged image was for dead and live bacteria, and three-dimensional reconstruction image was also showed. (B) Changes in biofilm volume of S. mutans after treatment with 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL cordycepin for 10\u00a0min two times (8\u00a0h and 20\u00a0h). (C) Live bacterial rate in S. mutans biofilm after treatment with 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL cordycepin for 10\u00a0min two times (8\u00a0h and 20\u00a0h). Compared with Control group (sterile water). All values are mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. *P\u2009<\u20090.05\n\n## Metabolic profile summaries\nTo explore the effects of cordycepin on S. mutans biofilm, metabolomic analysis of biofilm samples from different groups was performed. To further observe the immediate metabolic changes in S. mutans after cordycepin treatment, an immediate treatment group (Exp-20\u00a0h) was included in the metabolomics analysis. The three groups were Control-24\u00a0h, Exp-24\u00a0h, and Exp-20\u00a0h. The Control-24\u00a0h and Exp-24\u00a0h groups were treated with sterile water and cordycepin for 10\u00a0min, respectively, at the 8-h and 20-h time points, and culture was continued for 4\u00a0h. The Exp-20\u00a0h samples were collected immediately at the 20-h time point after the second cordycepin treatment. Differences in metabolism were analyzed between the three groups. The total ion chromatograms for the QC samples obtained from the Control-24\u00a0h (n\u2009=\u20096), Exp-20\u00a0h (n\u2009=\u20096), and Exp-24\u00a0h (n\u2009=\u20096) group samples in the ESI\u2009+\u2009and ESI- modes are presented in Appendix Figure S1 (A, B). The figures show a high degree of overlap between the total ion chromatograms is high, indicating good signal stability of the instrument. Appendix Figure S1 (C, D) displays the PCA plots of the Control-24\u00a0h, Exp-20\u00a0h, Exp-24\u00a0h, and QC samples, showing that the QC samples were grouped tightly together and were easily distinguishable from the treatment samples. These results demonstrated the consistency and reproducibility of the LC-MS analyses.\nThe PCA plots showed a clear separation of the Exp-20\u00a0h group from the other two groups, while the Control-24\u00a0h and Exp-24\u00a0h groups overlapped to some extent (Fig.\u00a03A and B). The OPLS-DA plots clearly distinguished between the groups (Fig.\u00a03C and D), and the 200-permutation test assessment of the model quality showed accurate prediction and modeling capacity, as shown in Fig.\u00a03E (ESI\u2009+\u2009model, R2X\u2009=\u20090.739, R2Y\u2009=\u20090.976 and Q2\u2009=\u20090.906) and Fig.\u00a03F (ESI- model, R2X\u2009=\u20090.789, R2Y\u2009=\u20090.987 and Q2\u2009=\u20090.893). These findings point to modifications in bacterial metabolites in response to cordycepin treatment.\nFig. 3PCA, OPLS-DA plots, and OPLS-DA permutation. (A-B) PCA plots for ESI\u2009+\u2009and ESI- modes; (C-D) OPLS-DA plots for ESI\u2009+\u2009and ESI- modes. (E-F) Validation plots were obtained from 200 permutation tests in (C) ESI+ (R2X\u2009=\u20090.739, R2Y\u2009=\u20090.976 and Q2\u2009=\u20090.906) and (D) ESI- (R2X\u2009=\u20090.789, R2Y\u2009=\u20090.987 and Q2\u2009=\u20090.893) modes. Control-24\u00a0h and Exp-24\u00a0h represent the 24\u00a0h biofilm model without and with cordycepin treatment, respectively. Exp-20\u00a0h represents the biofilm model treated with cordycepin a second time (20\u00a0h)\n\n## Identification of differential metabolites\nThe screening criteria used for the identification of differential metabolites were FC\u2009\u2265\u20092.0 or \u2264\u20090.5, VIP of more than 1, and corrected P-values of less than 0.05. The presence of differential metabolites in the Control-24\u00a0h vs. Exp-24\u00a0h (Cluster A), Control-24\u00a0h vs. Exp-20\u00a0h (Cluster B), and Exp-24\u00a0h vs. Exp-20\u00a0h (Cluster C) groups was evaluated using ESI\u2009+\u2009based on the predetermined criteria. Cluster A was found to have 9 differential metabolites, of which 3 were upregulated and 6 were downregulated (Fig.\u00a04A), while Cluster B showed 994 differential metabolites, with significant upregulation of 105 and downregulation of 889 metabolites (Fig.\u00a04C). Cluster C included 978 differential metabolites with 96 upregulated and 882 downregulated (Fig.\u00a04E). In the ESI- mode, 0, 850, and 832 differential metabolites were identified in Clusters A, B, and C, respectively. Figure\u00a04D shows that 47 differential metabolites were significantly upregulated while 803 were downregulated in Cluster B. Figure\u00a04F shows that 792 differential metabolites were significantly downregulated and 40 were upregulated in Cluster C.\nFig. 4Volcanic map of differential metabolites. (A-B) Differential metabolites identified in ESI\u2009+\u2009and ESI- modes for Cluster A (Control-24\u00a0h vs. Exp-24\u00a0h) samples; (C-D) Differential metabolites identified in ESI\u2009+\u2009and ESI- modes for Cluster B (Control-24\u00a0h vs. Exp-20\u00a0h) samples; (E-F) Differential metabolites identified in ESI\u2009+\u2009and ESI- modes for Cluster C (Exp-24\u00a0h vs. Exp-20\u00a0h) samples\n\n## KEGG annotation and enrichment analysis\nAssessment of the shared differential metabolites between the three groups i.e., Clusters A, B, and C, identifed four common differential metabolites, namely, 2\u2019-deoxyadenosine, 2\u2019-deoxyinosine, adenine, and allopurinol, in the ESI\u2009+\u2009mode. No differential metabolites shared between the three clusters were identified in the ESI- mode (Fig.\u00a05).\nFig. 5Summary of the results of the metabolic analysis. Substances in red font represent differential metabolites shared by Cluster A, B, and C, which are related to purine metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. The substances in blue font represent differential metabolites shared by Cluster B and Cluster C, which are associated with purine and nucleotide metabolism\nThe pathways with which these four differential metabolites were associated were then investigated using the S. mutans KEGG database. Allopurinol was not matched with any metabolic pathways, while adenine, 2\u2019-deoxyadenosine, and 2\u2019-deoxyinosine were found to be associated with five metabolic pathways, namely, purine metabolism (SMU00230), nucleotide metabolism (SMU01232), ABC transporters (SMU02010), metabolic pathways (SMU01100), and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (SMU01110). Of these, purine metabolism (SMU00230) and nucleotide metabolism (SMU01232), both of which showed low P-values and high scores, were considered worthy of further attention (Fig.\u00a06) and the metabolite levels associated with purine metabolism and nucleotide metabolism were assessed between the three groups. Immediately after treatment with cordycepin (Exp-20\u00a0h), the contents of 2\u2019-deoxyadenosine, 2\u2019-deoxyinosine, and adenine were found to be significantly upregulated, while after continued culture (Exp-24\u00a0h), the levels of the three metabolites decreased markedly. Moreover, the levels of both 2\u2019-deoxyadenosine and 2\u2019-deoxyinosine were higher than their original levels, while that of adenine was lower than the original level (Fig.\u00a07A-C). In addition, metabolites related to purine and nucleotide metabolism pathways, including adenosine, inosine, xanthosine, guanosine, adenosine monophosphate (AMP), inosine monophosphate (IMP), xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), hypoxanthine, xanthine, cyclic AMP, and cyclic GMP, were also investigated (Fig.\u00a07D-O). Although these metabolites were not part of the shared differential metabolites between Clusters A, B, and C, they were found to significantly different in Cluster B and Cluster C. After immediate treatment with cordycepin (Exp-20\u00a0h), the contents of these metabolites decreased significantly but were markedly raised after continued culture (Exp-24\u00a0h). Figure\u00a05 provides a summary of these results.\nFig. 6Pathways that were enriched for differentially abundant metabolites.

To explore potential changes in the expression of these genes in biofilms treated with cordycepin, three groups were evaluated, namely, Control-24\u00a0h and Exp-24\u00a0h in the 24-h biofilm model and Exp-20\u00a0h in the 20-h biofilm model. Figure\u00a08B shows that compared with the Control-24\u00a0h group, the expression levels of these genes associated with purine metabolism and nucleotide metabolism were significantly downregulated after cordycepin treatment (Exp-20\u00a0h) but were upregulated after continued culture (Exp-24\u00a0h).\nFig. 8Genes associated with purine metabolism and nucleotide metabolism in S. mutans (one-way ANOVA).
