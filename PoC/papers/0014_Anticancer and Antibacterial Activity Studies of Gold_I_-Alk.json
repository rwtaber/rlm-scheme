  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nPlatinum-based drugs (e.g., cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin) are an important class of anticancer agents with proven clinical and commercial value [1,2,3]. Promising anticancer active metal complexes include the ruthenium-based derivatives RAPTA-C [4], NAMI-A [5], KP1019 [6], PIM-1 inhibitors [7], and a family of iron-based ferrocifens [8,9]. Although none of these compounds have been introduced to the market so far, they revealed a hidden potential of metal complexes in cancer therapy. In that respect gold complexes also have a role to play. Gold continues to be a metal of exceptional importance as a decorative material and in the monetary system throughout the entire world. For centuries it has also attracted attention of alchemists and physicians [10]. Thanks to Robert Koch\u2019s observations of the bacteriostatic activity of K[Au(CN)2], gold complexes have entered modern medicine [11]. Aurothiomalate, aurothioglucose, aurothiosulfate, aurothiopropanol sulfonate and triethylphosphine gold(I) tetraacetylthioglucose are currently in clinical use modifying antirheumatic drugs. In fact, the application of gold thiolates for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis dates back to the 1930s of the 20th century [12]. In the 1980s the anticancer properties of auranofin were reported [13,14]. Recently we have witnessed a revival of gold complexes in medicinal chemistry and new results have demonstrated that gold complexes are promising anticancer [15,16,17,18] and antimicrobial [19,20] drug candidates. The majority of biologically tested gold complexes focus on gold ions in the +1 oxidation state and generally bound to thiolates [21,22], to various N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) [23,24,25,26,27], to diphos-type [28] and alkyne [29,30,31,32,33,34,35] ligands. There is also an increased interest in the development of anticancer gold(III)-NHC complexes [36,37,38]. Mechanistic studies revealed mitochondria and the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) as a key cellular and molecular targets for gold complexes [18,27,39]. It has been shown that positively charged gold complexes are able to effectively penetrate to the mitochondria due to the negative membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m) of this organelle [27,40]. In turn, accumulation of the gold metallodrug in the mitochondria and inhibition of the TrxR enzyme [40,41] has significant metabolic consequences, e.g., imbalance of intracellular redox potential, loss of mitochondrial respiration and an increasing of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration [40]. These alterations ultimately lead to the pro-apoptic proteins signalling induction [27,40,42]. In comparison to the other classes of biologically investigated gold(I) complexes [15,18,19,20,23,24,25,26,27,40,41] gold(I)-alkynyl complexes have been studied to the very limited extent [29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge to date there has not been any reported data on the antibacterial activity of gold(I)-alkynyl complexes although some in vitro antimalarial activity in two strains of Plasmodium falciparum has been published [32].\nChromone and its derivatives are plant metabolites of recognized medicinal importance [43,44]. Recently others [45,46,47,48] and our group [49,50,51,52] have demonstrated that adequately designed metallochromones show anticancer [45,46,47,50,51] and antibacterial [48,49] activity, and that they can also be utilized as luminescent probes in bioimaging [52]. Accordingly, the work reported herein was spurred by these interesting results and by the abovementioned medicinal relevance of gold complexes. Herein we report on the novel gold(I)-alkynyl chromone complexes 4\u20136. These compounds were biologically examined in respect to anticancer and bactericidal activity. The cellular uptake of compounds 4, 5 and 6 was investigated by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) while the mechanisms of their anticancer activity were studied by their cytotoxic performance, TrxR inhibition, caspase activation, and genotoxic effects. The Au-Fe bimetallic complex 5 provides us with the possibility to investigate whether the presence of two different metal centres may enhance the biological activity of the system in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear congener.\n\n## 2.1. Synthesis of Complexes \nThe synthesis of the gold(I)-alkynyl chromones 4, 5 and gold(I)-alkynyl flavone 6 was carried out according to Scheme 1.\nAlkynes 1, 2 and 3 were obtained according to the literature [50,53]. Their treatment with chloro-(triphenylphosphine)gold(I) complex and diisopropylamine in dichloromethane at 40 \u00b0C [54] afforded products 4, 5 and 6 in 79%, 67% and 49% yield respectively after purification. Gold(I)-alkynes 4 and 6 are colorless solids, while the binuclear complex 5 is an orange solid. The products were characterized by 1H-, 13C-, 31P-NMR, IR spectroscopy, MS and elemental analyses. The analytical data confirm the proposed constitution. The formation of complexes 4\u20136 was evidenced by the disappearance of the signals of the terminal ethynyl protons in the \u03b4 3.15\u20132.13 ppm range of their 1H-NMR spectra. The 31P-NMR spectra of 4\u20136 show a single phosphorus signal at ca. 42 ppm, similarly to other reported gold(I)-alkynyl complexes [32]. The IR spectra of complexes 4\u20136 show diagnostic ethynyl absorption bands at ca. 2119 cm\u22121 [30,32].\n\n## 2.2. X-ray Diffraction Study of Compounds\nThe molecular structures of complexes 5 and 6 were determined by single-crystal X-ray structure analyses (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Crystallographic details regarding data collections and structure refinements are summarized in Table S1. In both complexes, the gold atom shows a linear geometry with C-Au-P angles of 178.13(14)\u00b0 in 5 and 174.00(12)\u00b0 and 172.46(12)\u00b0 in 6, where two independent molecules are observed in the crystal lattice. In both complexes, the Au-C (1.99\u20132.00 \u00c5) and Au-P (2.27\u20132.28 \u00c5) distances are considered normal (see Table 1), and overall, the geometrical parameters around the gold atoms are almost identical in both complexes. These geometrical values are consistent with those found in analogous triphenylphosphine organo-gold complexes [29,55].\nIn 5, the ferrocenyl moiety is pointing away from the gold atom, the intramolecular separation between the two metals being 16.999(1) \u00c5. The ferrocenyl unit adopts an eclipsed conformation and is almost coplanar to the chromone moiety: the angle between the plane defined by the functionalized cyclopentadienyl ring (C18\u2013C21) and the chromone plane (C6\u2013C16) being 15.1(3)\u00b0. A coplanarity between the chromone moiety and the phenyl functional group is also observed in 6: the angles between the plane of the phenyl ring and the chromone are respectively 0.54(6)\u00b0 in 6A and 1.58(6)\u00b0 in 6B. This coplanarity is favored in the solid state due to strong \u03c0-stacking interactions between neighboring molecules.\nIndeed, the presence of large planar aromatic units in 6 generates an interesting molecular packing in the crystal (Figure 3). The chromone moieties alligned themselves to form layers, thus forcing the triphenylphosphine gold units to face each other. These large planar aromatic surfaces are only separated by 3.34 \u00c5, providing strong \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between these layers. On the other hand, no such strong \u03c0-stacking interactions are observed in 5 due to the non-planarity of the dinuclear complex and the presence of solvent molecules in the packing of the crystal.\n\n## 2.3.1. Antiproliferative Effect toward Human Cancer Cells\nIn the first stage of the study, complexes 4\u20136 and the reference compound auranofin were screened for cytotoxicity against solid (hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells MCF-7, estrogen-unresponsive breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231) and hematological (T lymphoblast-like CCRF-CEM) human cancer cells. Table 2 lists the IC50 concentrations obtained for the entire series of tested compounds.\nCollected in Table 2, the IC50 values for the reference auranofin complex are in a low micromolar range, thus indicating the high cytotoxic potency of this drug. The data obtained here show the overall cytotoxicity of conjugates 4\u20136, comparable to that of auranofin. Noticably, the most active of the series, i.e., complex 4, showed higher antiproliferative activity than auranofin against HepG2, MCF-7 and CCRF-CEM cells, with the lowest IC50 value of 3.5 \u00b1 1.1 for the latter cells. Also, flavone derivative 6 showed higher cytotoxicity against HepG2 and CCRF-CEM cells than the reference drug. The weakest cytotoxic activity was observed for the Au-Fe bimetallic complex 5. Although it was the less active of the whole series, complex 5 showed an enhancement in activity against the MCF-7 and CCRF-CEM cell lines when compared to that shown by its mononuclear ferrocenyl congener 2 [50]. Gold(I)-alkynyl complexes were also investigated in non-transformed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC-ST). Complexes 4, 5, and 6 showed IC50 values of 2.1 \u00b1 0.9, 3.1 \u00b1 1.1, and 2.9 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcmol/L respectively against HUVEC cells.\nThe next stage of the study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the cytotoxicity of gold complexes. These comprise cellular uptake, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition, genotoxic effect, caspase activation and cell cycle analysis. Only the most active complexes in the corresponding cell lines were investigated.\n\n## 2.3.2. Cellular Uptake with High-Resolution Continuum-Source Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy\nThe cellular uptake of complexes 4\u20136 into MCF-7 cells was studied by a method based on gold quantification by high-resolution atomic absorption spectroscopy (HRCS-AAS). For this purpose, the cells were exposed to 3.0 \u00b5M of the complexes, and the gold and protein levels of the cells were determined after 1, 4 and 8 h by HRCS-AAS and the Bradford method, respectively. Cellular gold levels are expressed as the amount (ng or nmol, respectively) of gold per mg of cell protein. In general, the obtained values (Figure 4) were within a similar range as compared to previously studied gold-alkynyl species [34].\nAfter a short exposure, complex 4 afforded the highest cellular gold levels, while 5 and 6 showed only marginal uptake. In contrast, after a longer incubation, 5 and 6 afforded increasing values and levels, with 4 decreasing slightly. This effect was most marked for 6, which afforded the highest cellular accumulation in this study after 8 h of exposure. The observed pattern indicates that the respective compounds undergo different ways of biodistribution and/or metabolisation. However, a correlation with the measured IC50 values of cytotoxicity is not apparent, especially in the case of the most active compound 4.\n\n## 2.3.3. TrxR Inhibition Assay\nThioredoxin reductase has been recognised as a key molecular target for organo-gold compounds [18,27,39]. Thus we decided to evaluate our complexes for TrxR inhibition. Data pertaining to the TrxR inhibition assay are shown in Figure 5. Complexes 4\u20136 considerably (p < 0.05) inhibited the activity of TrxR. Depending on the cell line and type of complex, a 20%\u201370% decrease was observed in the enzyme activity. The highest inhibition (70%) was found for complexes 4 and 6 in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, respectively. Likewise, complexes 4 and 6 inhibited, to a similar degree (about 20%), TrxR activity in CCRF-CEM cancer cells. The same inhibitory effect was noted for complex 4 in MDA-MB-231 cells and complex 5 in MCF-7 cells. Complex 6 performed similarly in MCF-7 and HepG2 cells (40% inhibition), and the same effect (about 45% inhibition) was found for complex 5 in CCRF-CEM cells and complex 4 in HepG2 cells. The above results show that TrxR is a molecular target for complexes 4\u20136, which is consistent with findings for other gold derivatives [18,27,39]. A comparison of the cytotoxic effects with TrxR inhibitory effects shows, however, that the cytotoxicity of the gold chromone complexes investigated here is not solely correlated with their effect on TrxR activity. Thus, other mechanisms of action should be considered as well.\n\n## 2.3.4. DNA Comet Assay\nThe alkaline version of the DNA comet assay (pH > 13) was used to assess damage to DNA caused by compounds 4\u20136. The method allows to specify both single- and double-strand DNA breaks and also damage to DNA nucleotides caused by the negative effects of oxidative stress. The technical details of the comet assay are described in the SI and the literature [56]. The results obtained from single-cell electrophoresis showed that compounds 4, 5 and 6 damaged the DNA of both solid and leukemic cancer cells. This DNA-damaging activity contributed to the cytotoxic effect of the investigated compounds. Figure 6 shows images taken under a fluorescence microscope for the control and for MCF-7 cells treated with 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Analogous images for CCRF-CEM, HEPG2, and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the tested complexes are shown in Figure S1 of the SI.\nAs can be seen in Figure 6, supercoiled loops of DNA linked to the nuclear matrix of untreated control cells are seen as retaining a compact structure resembling a comet head, which after staining with fluorescence dye DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) emits very bright and intense fluorescence. On the contrary, DNA supercoils released from cells treated with the tested compounds are more relaxed and thus migrate behind the head, forming a comet tail with weaker fluorescence. Figure 7 shows quantified data on the DNA content in the tail of the comet obtained from human cancer cells treated with compounds 4\u20136. Although the treated cells contained more tail DNA than the control cells, its amount did not exceed 10% and reached the highest value in MCF-7 cells incubated with compounds 4 and 5 (Figure 7). In the remaining treated cell lines the level of tail DNA was about 6%\u20138%, on average.\n\n## 2.3.5. Cell Cycle Analysis\nThe results of the comet assay were confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle of cancer cells incubated with complexes 4\u20136 for 24 h. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that the DNA damage observed in the comet assay is also reflected in the cancer cell\u2019s mitotic cell cycle disturbances. An example of the analyzed DNA histograms is shown in Figure S2.\nAs shown in Figure 8, the inhibitory effect of the assayed compounds on the cell cycle results mostly in a moderate decrease in the percentage of cells in the G1 phase (15%\u201320%, on average). In the CCRF-CEM and MCF-7 cell lines, simultaneous accumulation of cells in the G2/M checkpoint is observed. On the contrary, no substantial differences were found in inhibitory effects on the cell cycle of MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 cells between the investigated compounds. Importantly, flow cytometry analysis also revealed an increase in the sub-G1 peak, including hypodiploid apoptotic cells in all of the treated cell lines (Figure S2). The most profound changes (ca. 20% increase) were found in MCF-7 cells treated with the most active compound 4 (Table 3). The presence of sub-G1 peaks on the histograms is an established indicator of the onset of apoptosis [57,58,59,60].\n\n## 2.3.6. Caspase Activation Assay\nIn order to evaluate the pathway of apoptosis induced by the complexes, their ability to activate initiator caspases-8 and -9 and executioner caspase-3 was assessed. Activation of caspase-8 [61,62,63] is typical for the external (receptor) pathway of apoptosis, while activation of caspase-9 [64,65] is rather connected with the internal (mitochondrial) pathway. Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 can activate downstream caspase-3. Caspase-3 initiates apoptotic DNA fragmentation by proteolytically inactivating the DFF45/ICAD protein complex [65]. Figure 9 presents the data on the relative activity of caspases-8, -9 and -3 in cancer cell lines treated with complexes 4\u20136.\nCompounds 4, 5 and 6 induced activation of caspases-9 and -3 but not of caspase-8. A ca. 25% increase in the activities of caspases-9 and -3 were observed in all cancer cell lines treated with compound 4 for 24 h. In the MCF-7 cells, activation of caspases-9 and -3 was also triggered by compounds 5 and 6. The same two compounds were more selective and activated solely caspase-9 in CCRF-CEM (compound 5) and MDA-MB-231 (compound 6) cells. On the basis of the above results, it can be speculated that the gold complexes investigated here induce apoptosis of CCRF-CEM, HepG2, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-237 cells via the internal (mitochondrial) pathway.\n\n## 2.3.7. Evaluation of Antibacterial and Hemolytic Activity\nAntibacterial activity of complexes 4, 5, 6 and reference compound Au(PPh3)Cl was expressed by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and tested against Gram-positive methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacterial strains. The pertinent MIC data are presented in Table 4. In addition, compounds 4\u20136 were tested against four clinical isolates of the sensitive and resistant S. aureus strain (Table 4). The reference Au(PPh3)Cl complex revealed remarkable antibacterial (bactericidal) activity against whole tested Gram-positive S. aureus strains, including antibiotic-resistant MRSA pathogens. Its antibacterial potency was, however, lower against Gram-negative E. coli strains. Substitution of the Cl ligand in the reference Au(PPh3)Cl compound by either chromone (complexes 4 and 5) or flavone (complex 6) groups had a visible influence on the antibacterial activity profiles. Although high activity against Gram-positive S. aureus strains was retained for complexes 4 and 5, the bactericidal effect of flavone derivative 6 against these strains was diminished. Moreover, compounds 4\u20136 lacked any antibacterial activity against Gram-negative E. coli strains.\nIn view of these data it can be speculated that in comparison to the Cl anion, chromone and flavone ligands significantly alter the uptake of compounds 4\u20136 into bacterial cells. As for the structural differences between the walls of Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli bacterial strains, it can be hypothesized that the permeability of the latter with respect to complexes 4\u20136 is halted.\nComplexes 4\u20136 were examined in vitro for hemolytic activity. No hemolytic activity of 4\u20136 was observed on human erythrocytes.\n\n## 3.1. General Information\nAll preparations were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques. Chromatographic separations were carried out using silica gel 60 (Sigma-Aldrich, 230\u2013400 mesh ASTM, St. Louis, MO, USA). Dichloromethane was freshly distilled from CaH2 handled under nitrogen. Other solvents were of reagent grade and were used without prior purification. Alkyne substrates were obtained according to the literature method [50,53]. All other chemicals were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. The NMR spectra were recorded on a AV600 Kryo (600 MHz) spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). Chemical shifts are reported in \u03b4 (ppm) using residual CHCl3 (1H \u03b4 7.26 ppm, 13C \u03b4 77.00 ppm) and DMSO (1H \u03b4 2.50 ppm) as the references. Mass spectra were recorded using ES methods on a Varian 500-MS iT mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). IR spectra were recorded on a FTIR Nexus Nicolet apparatus (Nicolet, Madison, WI, USA). Microanalyses were determined by the Analytical Services of the Polish Academy of the Sciences (\u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland).\n\n## 3.2.1. Synthesis of \nIn a 40 mL Schlenk tube, alkynyl chromone 1 (100 mg, 0.3 mmol) was dissolved in dry and degassed dichloromethane (35 mL). The resultant solution was purged with argon for 15 min at room temperature. To this solution were added Au(PPh3)Cl (149 mg, 0.3 mmol) and diisopropylamine (1.5 mL, 11 mmol). The reaction mixture was protected against light and stirred at 40 \u00b0C for 24 h. After cooling to r.t. the reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness.

To purify product 6 two subsequent chromatographic purifications on SiO2 were necessary. The first with n-hexane/ethyl acetate, (3:2) as eluting mixture and the second with toluene/ethyl acetate (4:1) as eluting mixture respectively. The analytically pure product 6 were obtained after recrystallization from dichloromethane/n-hexane mixture. Colorless solid.

X-ray Crystallography\nOrange crystals of 5\u00b7CH2Cl2\u00b70.5 C4H10 were obtained by the slow evaporation of a CH2Cl2/n-butane solution, while colorless crystals of 6 were grown by the slow diffusion of n-hexane into a CH2Cl2 solution of the complex. Data were collected on a Stoe Image Plate Diffraction system equipped with a \u03a6 circle goniometer, using Mo-K\u03b1 graphite monochromatic radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) with \u03a6 range 0\u2013200\u00b0. The structures were solved by direct methods using the program SHELXS-97, while the refinement and all further calculations were carried out using SHELXL-97 [66]. The H-atoms were included in calculated positions and treated as riding atoms using the SHELXL default parameters. The non-H atoms were refined anisotropically, using weighted full-matrix least-square on F2. Crystallographic details for 5\u00b7CH2Cl2\u00b70.5 C4H10 and 6 are summarized in Table S1. Figure 1 and Figure 2 were drawn with ORTEP [67] and Figure 3 with Mercury [68]. CCDC 1061082 5\u00b7CH2Cl2\u00b70.5 C4H10 and 1061083 6 contain the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre via www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/data_request/cif.\n\n## 3.4.1. Cell Lines\nThree adherent tumor cell lines: human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2; ATCC HB-8065\u2122), estrogen-responsive adenocarcinoma (MCF-7; ATCC HTB-22\u2122) and estrogen-unresponsive adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231; ATCC HTB-26\u2122) supplied by ATCC (Rockville, Manassas, VA, USA) were used in all experiments. Suspension T lymphoblast like polymorph cell line (CCRF-CEM) was kindly donated by Prof. G. Bartosz from Department of Molecular Biophysics, University of Lodz (Poland). Additionally adherent human endothelial cell line HUVEC-ST supplied by ATCC (Rockville, Manassas, VA, USA) were used as a model for normal cells in the MTT assay.\n\n## 3.4.2. Cell Culture\nAdherent cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) were cultured as a monolayer in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (Sigma, Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, NY, USA), penicillin-streptomycin (10 mg/mL) 1% (v/v) (Gibco) under a 100% humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air, at 37 \u00b0C. Exponential growth of cells was maintained by their regular passaging at 90% confluence three times a week using 0.025% trypsin/EDTA. CCRF-CEM cells were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium enriched with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), penicillin-streptomycin (10 mg/mL) 1% (v/v) (Gibco) under the culture conditions described above. Cell cultures, after centrifugation at 400 rpm for 5 min, were resuspended at a density of 2 \u00d7 105 viable cells/mL. Periodically, all cell lines were routinely screened for mycoplasma contamination.\n\n## 3.4.3. Evaluation of Cytotoxic Activity (MTT Assay)\nAnticancer activity of complexes 4, 5 and 6 was evaluated in vitro on the basis of their ability to inhibit the proliferation of HepG2, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and CCRF-CEM cancer cells. For this purpose a standard MTT microplate assay with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,3-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma Aldrich) was used. Cells were seeded a day before the experiment onto a 96-well microplate at the density up to 12 \u00d7 103 cells/well (depending on the cell line) and exposed to investigated compounds, resolved in an appropriate culture medium in a concentration range of 0.5\u2013120 \u03bcM, for 24 h. At the end of incubation the medium was replaced with a new one devoid of organometallic derivatives. The cells were grown for additional 48 h (post-incubation culture in a drug-free medium). At this time point the number of viable cells in each well was estimated by the MTT test. 50 \u00b5L of MTT (5 mg/mL final concentration) was added to each microplate well and the cells were incubated for 4 h in a CO2 incubator. Then MTT solution was discarded and a 100 \u00b5L DMSO/well was added in order to dissolved formazan crystals formed during the reduction of MTT by mitochondrial dehydrogenases of metabolically active cells. Absorbance of purple formazan solution was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Nonadherent CCRF-CEM were centrifuged for 5 min at 800 rpm each time before replacing an old solution with new one. Cytotoxicity of the assayed complexes was evaluated on the basis of their IC50 concentrations that reduced cell viability by 50% compared with that of untreated control cells, arbitrary taken as 100%. Moreover, similar evaluation was conducted for human endothelial cell line (HUVEC-ST) used as a model for normal cells.\n\n## 3.4.4. Thioredoxin Reductase Inhibition Assay\nTo assess the enzymatic activities of the thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity colorimetric assay kit (Bio Vision, Milpitas, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The method is based on the ability of TrxR to catalyze the reduction of 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) with NADPH to 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB2), which generate a strong yellow color with maximum at 412 nm). Since in crude biological samples other enzymes, such as glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase, can also reduce DTNB, therefore, TrxR specific inhibitor is utilized to determine TrxR specific activity. Two assays are performed: the first measurement is of the total DTNB reduction by the sample, and the second one is the DTNB reduction by the sample in the presence of the TrxR specific inhibitor. The difference between the two results is the DTNB reduction by TrxR. Cells were seeded onto 35 mm dishes at the density of 50 \u00d7 104 and cultured for 24 h in drug-free medium. Then tested complexes were added at IC50 concentration and the cells were incubated with t",
