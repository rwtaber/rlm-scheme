  "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen causing nosocomial infections. K. pneumoniae rapidly acquires antibiotic resistance and is known as a reservoir for resistance genes. Polymyxins remain effective as a last-line therapy against infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae; however, resistance to polymyxins emerges rapidly with monotherapy. Synergistic combinations of polymyxins with FDA-approved non-antibiotics are a novel approach to preserve its efficacy whilst minimising the emergence of polymyxin resistance in K. pneumoniae. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic antibacterial activity of polymyxin B in combination with the anti-fungal caspofungin against K. pneumoniae. The combination of polymyxin B and caspofungin showed marked synergistic antibacterial killing activity in checkerboard broth microdilution and static time-kill assays at clinically relevant concentrations at early (0.5 and 1\u00a0h) and later (4\u00a0h) time points. The potential bacterial killing mechanism of the combination was studied against K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001 using metabolomics and transcriptomics studies at 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h. The key pathways involved in the synergistic killing action of the combination were cell wall assembly (peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis), central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle) and fatty acid biosynthesis. Moreover, the combination inhibited the most common bacterial virulence pathway (phosphotransferase system) as well as the multi-resistant efflux mechanisms, including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter pathway. Overall, this study sheds light on the possibility of a polymyxin-caspofungin combination for the treatment of infections caused by K. pneumoniae and may help repurpose FDA-approved caspofungin against MDR K. pneumoniae infections.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nThe global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis is one of the three biggest threats to human health, as highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. The frequency of infections caused by AMR has increased every year for the past twenty years [2], and has been estimated to be responsible for at least 35,000 deaths annually across the United States [3]. Despite the profound clinical and economic consequences caused by AMR, only few new classes of antibiotics have been approved for clinical use in the past four decades [4]. The diminishing antibiotic pipeline, coupled with the mounting AMR, threatens the modern healthcare system, hence novel therapies are urgently needed to combat infections caused by these \u2018superbugs\u2019 in this rapidly approaching post-antibiotic era. Gram-negative pathogens like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are responsible for the increasing number of nosocomial infections that are difficult to treat as they have accumulated resistance to several classes of antibiotics [5].\nK. pneumoniae is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that is increasingly responsible for both hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteraemia in immunocompromised patients [6], [7], [8]. This pathogen can acquire and amplify wider range of AMR genes with increased capability to act like a reservoir for resistance plasmids, which can be trafficked to other Gram-negative pathogens [9]. In fact, many of the common antibiotic-resistant genes found in MDR Gram-negative bacteria were first discovered in the Klebsiella species [10].\nThe emergence of MDR bacteria, combined with the dry antibiotic pipeline, led to the revival of polymyxins as a last-line therapeutic treatment [11]. Polymyxins are an old class of cyclic lipopeptide antibiotics that were approved in the late 1950s [12], [13]. Polymyxins have a narrow spectrum of antibacterial activity and are mainly effective against Gram-negative pathogens [14]. The precise mechanisms of action of polymyxins have not yet been fully elucidated, but many theories have been put forth such as the \u2018self-promoted\u2019 uptake mechanism [15], [16]. In this putative mechanism, polymyxins are thought to primarily target the lipid A acyl chains on the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in the competitive displacement of ionic bridges that stabilise the LPS and thereby disrupting the OM permeability [13], [17], [18]. Reports of hetero-resistance in MDR K. pneumoniae is suggestive of the inadequacy of polymyxin monotherapy [19]. This has emphasized the urgent need for optimizing of polymyxin exposure for preserving its antimicrobial activity to minimise or limit the further emergence of polymyxin-resistant K. pneumoniae. Higher polymyxin B doses and longer duration of therapy are associated with increased prevalence of polymyxin B nephrotoxicity. Hence there is increasing interest in designing effective treatment strategies to treat MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections that limit the polymyxin B exposure, i.e. by polymyxin combination with FDA-approved non-antibiotics [20], [21], [22]. The ability of polymyxins to disrupt the OM raises the potential that polymyxins could aid in enabling non-antibiotic drugs to gain entry into the bacteria and interact with the intracellular targets and reveal their antibacterial effects [23], [24], [25].\nCaspofungin, is one such FDA approved non-antibiotic, a derivative of pneumocandin B0, is a naturally occurring lipophilic cyclic antifungal peptide that belongs to the family of echinocandin [26]. Like polymyxins, caspofungin is reserved for difficult-to-treat invasive fungal infections which occur in immunocompromised patients such as those with malignancies or HIV infections [27], [28]. Caspofungin is generally very well tolerated with a highly favourable safety profile due to few adverse effects, limited toxicity and relatively few drug-drug interaction [29], [30]. Due to its low toxicity and low resistance rates, caspofungin is a very attractive alternative in fungal infection prophylaxis and treatment [31].\nThe synergistic bacterial killing activity of polymyxin B plus caspofungin combination treatment has not been studied. Adams et. al (2016) is the only other study that studied the in vitro synergistic activity of the polymyxin B-caspofungin combination against fluconazole-resistant Candida glabrata yeast isolates [32]. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential pharmacodynamics of polymyxins in combination with caspofungin against polymyxin-susceptible and -resistant K. pneumoniae isolates and investigate the underlying mechanism of their synergistic activity employing metabolomics and transcriptomics.\n\n## MIC and FICI determination\nPolymyxin B and caspofungin MIC results are documented in Supplementary Table S1. Polymyxin B in combination with caspofungin displayed excellent synergy against thirteen polymyxin-susceptible K. pneumoniae isolates with FICI values ranging from 0.03 to 0.25. The combination also displayed synergistic activity against three polymyxin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, including FADDI-KP030, FADDI-KP001 and FADDI-KP005 with FICI values of 0.03, 0.09 and 0.31, respectively. However, indifferent effect (FICI\u00a0=\u00a00.53) against only one polymyxin-resistant K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP062 was seen after combination treatment. Furthermore, the combination did not result in synergistic activity against the other three polymyxin resistant K. pneumoniae isolates. This suggests that polymyxin B potentially permeabilizes the polymyxin-susceptible K. pneumoniae outer membrane which in turn enables the entry of caspofungin intracellularly and thereby, both drugs work collaboratively to kill the bacteria (Supplementary Table S1) [23], [33].\n\n## Time-kill kinetics\nCaspofungin as monotherapy against both K. pneumoniae strains (K. pneumoniae ATCC13883 and FADDI-KP001) exhibited no remarkable antibacterial activity across all time points (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). While polymyxin B monotherapy (0.25\u00a0mg/L) resulted in a significant decrease in bacterial count of K. pneumoniae ATCC13883 (>3 log10 CFU/mL) and FADDI-KP001 (>2 log10 CFU/mL) compared to the untreated control by 1\u00a0h, however; this was followed by regrowth similar to the control after 4\u00a0h (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B).\nOn the other hand, against the polymyxin-susceptible K. pneumoniae ATCC13883, combination therapy was more effective in the first 1\u00a0h resulting in\u00a0>\u00a04 log10 CFU/mL decrease in the initial inoculum, with regrowth suppressed until at least 4\u00a0h prior to observable regrowth by 24\u00a0h (Supplementary Fig. S1A). A similar trend was observed against the polymyxin-resistant K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001, where the combination of polymyxin B and caspofungin reduced the bacterial inoculum by\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 log10 CFU/mL by 1\u00a0h as compared to both the control (untreated) as well as the polymyxin B monotherapy (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The difference in bacterial killing after 1\u00a0h between the combination and the polymyxin B monotherapy was much more pronounced for the K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001 (2.3-fold log10 CFU/mL) compared to that for K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883 (1.5-fold log10 CFU/mL). Notably, the polymyxin B-caspofungin combination was substantially more effective compared to both monotherapies and control across all time points.\n\n## Metabolic perturbations of \nThe killing activity of polymyxin B-caspofungin combination in static time-kill studies was carried out against K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001 (\u223c108 CFU/mL) for the purposes of determining appropriate conditions for sample preparation to perform metabolomics analysis. The polymyxin B concentration of 2\u00a0mg/L and caspofungin concentration of 10\u00a0mg/L were used as monotherapy and in combination (Supplementary Fig. S2).\nMultivariate data analysis using One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by principal component analysis (PCA) were performed in order to determine the significant metabolites affected by treatment conditions (\u22650.59-log2-fold; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The PCA plots showed that combination treatment samples were significantly separated from all other treatment conditions at 0.5\u00a0h (Supplementary Fig. S3A). There was noticeable overlap between the combination treatment and polymyxin B monotherapy at 1\u00a0h, suggesting that the combination effect was mainly driven by polymyxin B (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Notably, at the 4\u00a0h timepoint there was some overlap between the polymyxin B and caspofungin mono and the combination treated samples in some components, the combination treatment was still distant from the control (untreated) samples (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Similarly, in line with the previous results, heatmap showed that the impact of combination treatment was significantly different compared to the control and monotherapy with either drug (Supplementary Fig. S3B).\nThe bacterial metabolome was impacted the most by the combination, perturbing 131, 153 and 162 significant metabolites at 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Perturbations produced by monotherapy with either caspofungin and polymyxin B was less comparatively as caspofungin induced only 8 (0.5\u00a0h), 14 (1\u00a0h) and 10 (4\u00a0h) significantly perturbed metabolites while even fewer significant metabolites 14 (0.5\u00a0h), 9 (1\u00a0h) and 3 (4\u00a0h) were induced by polymyxin B (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Notably, there were 117, 135 and 153 unique metabolites induced only by combination therapy at 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4B). The combination therapy shared more metabolites with polymyxin B alone (11 intermediates) than with caspofungin (4 metabolites) at 0.5\u00a0h; however, at later time points (1 and 4\u00a0h) the combination therapy shared more intermediates with caspofungin (12 metabolites, 1\u00a0h; 8 metabolites, 4\u00a0h) compared to polymyxin B alone (9 metabolites, 1\u00a0h; 3 metabolites, 4\u00a0h).\nThe classification of significantly changed metabolites has shown that carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, and peptides were largely altered compared to other classes of metabolites in response to treatment across all time exposures (0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h) (Supplementary Fig. S5). The highest number of metabolites were altered in response to the combination as compared to monotherapy with polymyxin B and caspofungin. The most significant changes in response to combination treatment were a decrease in carbohydrates (0.5 and 1\u00a0h) and amino acids (4\u00a0h) while an elevation in the abundance of lipids was seen across all time points (0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h) (Supplementary Fig. S5).\n\n## Transcriptomics analysis of \nTranscriptomics study was employed to investigate the transcriptomic responses of K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001 following treatment with mono and combination treatment with polymyxin B (2\u00a0mg/L) and caspofungin (10\u00a0mg/L) at 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h. At 0.5\u00a0h, a total of 349/190 (up/down) and 98/80 (up/down) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were induced by monotherapy with polymyxin B and caspofungin respectively. Transcriptomic response observed following treatment with polymyxin B-caspofungin resulted in 474/394 (up/down) DEGs at 0.5\u00a0h (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Supplementary Fig. S6A). DEGs at 1\u00a0h following monotherapy with polymyxin B (89 up/94 down) and caspofungin (26 up/17 down) were lower compared to the number of DEGs (148 up/343 down) expressed in response to the combination treatment (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Similarly, at 4\u00a0h, mono- and combination therapy with polymyxin B and caspofungin resulted in 84/26 (up/down), 102/45 (up/down) and 290/96 (up/down) DEGs (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) respectively (Supplementary Fig. S9A). Across all time points, venn diagrams generated from the RNA expression profiles revealed polymyxin B as the main driver of perturbations in gene expression in the polymyxin B-caspofungin combination treatment. There were a large number of differentially expressed genes in common between polymyxin B and combination, particularly at 0.5\u00a0h (209 DEGs) and 1\u00a0h (49 DEGs) (Supplementary Fig. S6B). The number of unique DEGs in the combination treatment were 254 (0.5\u00a0h), 92 (1\u00a0h) and 174 (4\u00a0h) (Supplementary Fig. S6B). DEGs of each time point (0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h) following each treatment (polymyxin B, caspofungin and the combination) were mapped to the metabolic pathways. Similar to the metabolomic analysis, the polymyxin B-caspofungin combination treatment comparatively affected significantly more pathways compared to either monotherapy. Intriguingly, cell envelope biogenesis, PTS, ABC transporter system, central carbon metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis were among the most significantly expressed pathways across all time points. The genes names and annotation of the DEGs involved in the significantly expressed pathways are listed in Supplementary Table S2.\n\n## Metabolic analyses of perturbations in lipid metabolism\nMonotherapy with either polymyxin B or caspofungin had no effect on lipid intermediates of K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001, and all perturbations in lipid metabolism were caused by combination therapy only across the earlier time points of 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h (Fig. 1). The crucial precursors of bacterial membrane lipids, sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a03.08) and sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a03.02) were significantly increased following combination therapy at 0.5\u00a0h (Fig. 1). However, CDP-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol, a CDP-diacyl-glycerol that functions as a biosynthetic intermediate in the formation of the major membrane-forming phospholipid phosphatidylcholine [34], was extensively reduced (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-7.93) due to the combination treatment at 0.5\u00a0h. Polymyxin B-caspofungin caused nearly equal perturbations in fatty acids and glycerophospholipids metabolites at 0.5\u00a0h. However, the combination treatment induced a different response at 1\u00a0h, wherein the impact on the levels of fatty acid intermediates (10 metabolites) were higher compared to the shift in glycerophospholipids (only 3 metabolites) (Fig. 1). At 1\u00a0h, two essential membrane phospholipid fatty acids, namely FA(16:0) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a03.15) and FA(17:0) (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a03.51) were significantly increased in response to the combination treatment (Fig. 1). It is hypothesized that increased abundance of these saturated fatty acids can decrease the fluidity of the bacterial membrane which in turn will reduce the LpxK activity and thereby, biogenesis of LPS [35], [36]. At 4\u00a0h, the combination induced more perturbations in fatty acids compared to glycerophospholipids, including membrane phospholipid fatty acid FA(16:0), FA hydroxy(16:0) and FA oxo(16:0) (\u22651.5-log2-fold; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).

It has been shown that one of the possible bacterial killing mechanisms displayed by polymyxins is the disorganisation and destabilisation of the bacterial OM [12], [37]. Diaminopimelic acid (DAP) is an amino acid that is utilised as an intermediate for lysine biosynthesis as well as DAP-type peptidoglycan formation in several Gram-negative bacteria [38]. A high level of suppression in the abundance of multiple key metabolites involved in cell wall biosynthesis (amino- and nucleotide sugar metabolism, lysine, peptidoglycan and LPS biosynthetic pathways) was clearly observed after polymyxin B-caspofungin treatment particularly at 1\u00a0h (Fig. 2A & B). At 0.5\u00a0h, the level of few building blocks of cell wall envelope were significantly reduced after polymyxin B-caspofungin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7). However, more perturbation due to the combination therapy occurred at 1\u00a0h, at which the combination therapy caused a significant suppression in the levels of three key precursors of amino- and nucleotide sugar metabolism [1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramate, N-acetylmuramate and UDP-N-acetylmuramate] and the intimately interrelated LPS biogenesis pathway [D-ribose 5-phosphate, D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO)] (\u2265\u20131.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 2A & B). Admittedly, D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate is a heptose unit that makes up one of the key building blocks of the LPS inner core of Gram-negative bacteria as well as act as a central metabolite for the pentose phosphate pathway; KDO is highly conserved in bacteria and is essential for cell viability [39]. Furthermore, another downstream pathways, peptidoglycan, and lysine metabolisms, were significantly perturbed in response to polymyxin B-caspofungin combination therapy at 1\u00a0h (Fig. 2A & B).Fig. 2(A) Diagrammatic and (B) heatmap representation of all significantly impacted metabolites involved in the interconnected pathways of the cell envelope biogenesis (amino- and nucleotide sugar metabolism, lysine, peptidoglycan, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthetic pathways) in K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001 after polymyxin B (PMB) and caspofungin (CSP) monotherapies and their combination (COM) at 1\u00a0h (\u2265-1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Blue rectangles represent the downregulated metabolites. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nIn comparison to 0.5 and 1\u00a0h, the combination therapy caused more perturbations in the lysine pathway than other cell wall formation interconnected pathways such as amino- and nucleotide sugar metabolism, peptidoglycan and LPS pathways at 4\u00a0h, wherein the abundance of ten intermediates of lysine pathway were significantly supressed (except for 5-aminopentanamide, log2FC\u00a0=\u00a02.05), namely LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate, N6-acetyl-LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate, meso-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate, N6-acetyl-L-lysine, L-pipecolate, 5-acetamidopentanoate, 5-aminopentanoate, 2-oxoglutarate and glutarate (\u2265-1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Supplementary Fig. S7). Notably, both polymyxin B and caspofungin monotherapies displayed minor impact on all cell wall interconnected pathways (lysine, amino- and nucleotide sugar metabolism, peptidoglycan and LPS pathways) at all time exposure (0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h) (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S7).\nIn line with the metabolomics results, the combination treatment resulted in more genes involved in metabolic pathways (amino- and nucleotide sugar metabolism, lysine, peptidoglycan and LPS biosynthetic pathways) related to the cell wall assembly at all time points, particularly 1\u00a0h (Fig. 3A-C). While polymyxin B and caspofungin alone resulted in minimal changes in DEGs of these pathways at 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h (Fig. 3A-C). Intriguingly, a marked rise in the expression of a crucial gene ftsI, which involved in the catalysis of cross-linking of the peptidoglycan cell wall [40], was observed following polymyxin B alone and the combination treatment at 0.5 and 1\u00a0h (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, at the same time exposure 0.5 and 1\u00a0h, both polymyxin B monotherapy and the combination therapy caused a significant up-regulation in LPS inner core formation gene namely kdsC (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 3C) [41]. Importantly, a gene (lpxD) coding for the lipid A biosynthesis, a phosphorylated glycolipid that moors the LPS with the bacterial outer membrane, was up regulated in response to caspofungin monotherapy (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a01.25) and the combination therapy (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a01.25) at 1\u00a0h (Fig. 3C)[42]. At 4\u00a0h, all treatment groups induced less perturbation in genes involved in the interconnected metabolic pathways of the cell envelope formation (Fig. 3A-C).Fig. 3Differentially expressed genes (log2 fold change) of K. pneumoniae FADD-KP001 after polymyxin B (PMB), caspofungin (CSP) and the combination (PMB/CSP) treatments involved in the cell wall biosynthesis interconnected pathways of amino- and nucleotide sugar metabolism, lysine, peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways, and phosphotransferase system, ABC transporter and RND operon, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cycle and fatty acids metabolic pathways at 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h (>1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).\n\n## Metabolic and transcriptomic alteration of the central carbon metabolism\nCentral carbohydrate metabolism in bacteria is a complex cellular network which involves multiple pathways such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), citrate cycle and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and hence the target of investigation for a new generation of antibiotics [43], [44]. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that polymyxin B-caspofungin treatment induced a greater perturbation in metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism across all time points (0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h) while minor changes in these pathways were caused by polymyxin B and caspofungin treatment alone (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S8). Polymyxin B-caspofungin therapy resulted in a significant decline in the levels of eight fundamental building blocks of glycolysis pathway at 0.5\u00a0h, whereas the abundance of only two essential elements of the glycolysis were significantly reduced following treatment with polymyxin B alone (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Furthermore, the levels of crucial precursors of the closely related pathways the PPP (acetyl-CoA, (S)-lactate, cis-aconitate, succinate and citrate) and the TCA cycle (D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and 6-phospho-2-dehydro-D-gluconate) were significantly perturbed following the combination therapy at 0.5\u00a0h (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Polymyxin B monotherapy also reduced the abundance of acetyl-CoA (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-0.61) at 0.5\u00a0h (Supplementary Fig. S8A). It is a well-known that acetyl-CoA mediates several metabolic processes in bacteria such as supply of acetyl groups to citrate cycle, fatty acid and amino acid biosynthesis, and it is mainly supplied by the glycolysis [45].Fig. 4Schematic pathway diagram depicting the significantly influenced precursors of central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cycle) and interrelated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway of K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001 due to polymyxin B (PMB), caspofungin (CSP) monotherapies and their combination at 1\u00a0h (\u2265-1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Blue rectangles represent the supressed metabolites. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)\nAt 1\u00a0h, polymyxin B monotherapy had no impact on central carbon metabolism, whereas caspofungin monotherapy significantly suppressed the levels of three key metabolites (D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and glycerone phosphate) from glycolysis and one key component (D-ribose 5-phosphate) from PPP at 1\u00a0h (\u2265-1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 4). This perturbation paled in comparison to the impact of polymyxin B-caspofungin combination treatment, where twenty metabolites in central carbon metabolism pathway, including 9 glycolysis intermediates (e.g., glycerone phosphate and D-glucose), 6 TCA intermediates (e.g., succinate and citrate) and 5 PPP intermediates (e.g., D-ribose-5-phosphate and D-sedoheptulose-7-phospahte), were markedly declined (\u2265-1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 4). The TCA cycle has a direct role in bacterial cellular respiration, as well as supplies several key metabolites, such as succinate and citrate, which are important intermediates required for other bacterial metabolic processes such as fatty acid and amino acid metabolism [46]. The effect of the combination treatment on glycolysis, PPP and TCA started to decline at 4\u00a0h, which was comparable to its effect at 0.5\u00a0h (Supplementary Fig. S8B). In comparison to the combination treatment, polymyxin B and caspofungin monotherapies did not display significant impact on the central carbon metabolism at 4\u00a0h (Supplementary Fig. S8B).\nThe transcriptomic response of central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, PPP, and TCA) was similar to patterns of abovementioned metabolic pathways, where polymyxin B-caspofungin combination caused extensive dysregulation in the levels of genes involved in this complex pathway across all time points, in particular 1\u00a0h (Fig. 3D-F). While polymyxin B and caspofungin monotherapies induced expression of central carbon metabolism genes at 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h to a lesser extent (Fig. 3D-F). In glycolysis, polymyxin B (4\u00a0h) and the combination therapy (1 and 4\u00a0h) significantly dysregulated the expression of an essential gene namely acs (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, acs gene, encoding acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, can mediate the conversion of acetate into acetyl-CoA, the latter is an essential intermediate used by bacterial cell to generate energy via TCA cycle and helps maintain the bacterial cell membrane integrity via formation of fatty acid precursors [47], [48]. Notably, polymyxin B and caspofungin per se caused a significant upregulation in the abundance of principal TCA cycle gene sucA at 4\u00a0h (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 3F). Whereas the expression of sucA was significantly supressed following polymyxin B-caspofungin therapy at 1\u00a0h (\u2265-1.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05); nevertheless, at 4\u00a0h, the combination therapy revealed a conversed pattern as indicated by causing a significant upregulation in the level of the same gene (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 3E). It has been found that sucA gene knockout attenuates TCA cycle and glycolysis in Gram-negative bacteria, which in turn impairs the proton motive force and bacterial cell growth [49].\n\n## Metabolic and transcriptomic perturbations of the fatty acid biosynthesis\nPhospholipids in bacterial OM is made up of glycerolipids with two fatty acid chains. These acyl chains determine membrane viscosity, which in turn has an influence on many key membrane-associated bacterial functions, namely membrane permeability for hydrophobic molecules (including drugs), active transport and protein\u2013protein interactions [50]. Therefore, survival is highly dependent on membrane lipid homeostasis and the ability of bacteria to adjust their lipid composition in response to their external environments [51]. As a result, fatty acid biosynthesis pathway has been studied as a novel target for antibacterial drug discovery [52]. Fatty acid biosynthesis is closely related pathway to the central carbon metabolism [53].\nIntriguingly, polymyxin B-caspofungin treatment significantly disorganised the fatty acids biosynthesis pathway at all time exposure particularly 1\u00a0h (Supplementary Fig. S9). Whilst polymyxin B and caspofungin treatment alone had no impact on fatty acid biosynthesis at all time points (0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h) (Supplementary Fig. S9). Notably, a significant rise in the levels of three essential fatty acids components (tetradecanoic acid, (9Z)-hexadecenoic acid and (9Z)-octadecenoic acid) was observed following the combination treatment at 0.5 and 4\u00a0h (\u22651.5-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Supplementary Fig. S9). However, a greater impact was induced by polymyxin B-caspofungin treatment at 1\u00a0h, wherein the levels of five metabolites namely tetradecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, (9Z)-hexadecenoic acid and (9Z)-octadecenoic acid were significantly increased (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Supplementary Fig. S9).\nIn the transcriptomic analysis, polymyxin B and caspofungin monotherapies significantly dysregulated a fundamental transcript of fatty acid metabolism namely fabG at 1 and 4\u00a0h, respectively (\u22651.0-log2-fold, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) (Fig. 3G). Similarly, fabG experienced a marked downregulation with polymyxin B in combination with caspofungin at 0.5 and 1\u00a0h (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.30 and \u22121.84, respectively), which at the later time point 4\u00a0h conversely displayed an overrepresentation (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a01.77) (Fig. 3G). Furthermore, the level of fadl gene was significantly downregulated (log2FC\u00a0=\u00a0-1.59) in response to polymyxin B-caspofungin combination treatment at 1\u00a0h (Fig. 3G). The fabG and fadl genes play an important role in the synthesis of fatty acids in Gram-negative bacteria as they are required for the elongation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid [53]. Downregulation of long-chain fatty acid transport protein (FadL) is associated with antimicrobial peptides resistant Gram-negative bacteria; therefore, there has been a growing interest to develop antibacterial agents to target fatty acid biosynthesis [54], [55].\n\n## Metabolic and transcriptomic perturbations in phosphotransferase system (PTS) pathway\nPTS in Gram-negative bacteria, plays various roles in multiple aspects of bacterial physiology such as biofilm formation, virulence, and transposon-mediated directed mutation [56], [57], [58]. It also plays a role in the catalysis of sugar transport, phosphorylation and chemoreception, in addition to these primary functions, it possesses secondary functions like metabolic and transcriptomic regulations [59]. Apart from its potential impact on membrane structure, pathway enrichment analysis also illustrated that the effect of the combination therapy on PTS pathway was prominent at 1\u00a0h (12 metabolites) compared to the minor impact it had at 0.5\u00a0h (5 metabolites) and 4\u00a0h (4 metabolites). On the other hand, polymyxin B and caspofungin monotherapies, in comparison to the combination treatment, caused a minor effect on the PTS pathway at 0.5, 1 and 4\u00a0h (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. S10).Fig. 5Whisker plots of s",
