  "title": "Antifungal agent tavaborole as a potential broad-spectrum serine and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases inhibitor.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The global emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in clinical settings have driven the search for inhibitors that can counteract carbapenemases. These enzymes include several serine \u03b2-lactamases (SBLs, such as KPC) and metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs, such as NDM) that hydrolyse almost all \u03b2-lactams including carbapenems. This endeavour has successful developed some SBL inhibitors, including the boron-containing compound vaborbactam. However, the challenge posed by MBLs remains unresolved. METHODS: A high-throughput screening was conducted on 1718 FDA-approved drugs as potential adjuvants to meropenem. The synergistic effect was determined by checkerboard assay. The underlying mechanisms were elucidated using enzyme inhibition assays, molecular docking and dynamics simulations. The safety and efficacy were evaluated using a murine model. FINDINGS: We have identified another boron-containing broad-spectrum serine and metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, the benzoxaborole antifungal agent tavaborole. In vitro, tavaborole enhances the antibacterial activity of multiple \u03b2-lactam antibiotics against bacteria producing either SBLs or MBLs. In vivo, injectable administration of tavaborole has demonstrated good safety in mice and has restored the efficacy of meropenem against blaNDM-5 and blaKPC-2-positive bacterial infection in a mouse intraperitoneal model. Tavaborole may effectively inhibit the activity of SBLs and MBLs by covalently bonding with the active serine residue of SBLs and chelating the Zn2+ at the active center of MBLs. INTERPRETATION: Tavaborole shows good potential as an agent for use in combination with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics for treating multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections.

  "full_text": "## Evidence before this study\nThe emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has rendered nearly all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics ineffective, posing a urgent threat to public health. These bacteria often harbour additional resistance genes, further limiting clinical treatment options. Recent advancements have led to the development of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors that effectively target class A and class C serine \u03b2-lactamases (SBLs). However, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs) continue to present a major challenge. Moreover, in the early stages of infections caused by \u03b2-lactam-resistant pathogens, selecting an appropriate treatment regimen is particularly difficult due to the inability to rapidly identify the specific type of \u03b2-lactamases involved.\n\n## Added value of this study\nThis study conducted a comprehensive screening of 1718 FDA-approved drugs and identified the benzoxaborole antifungal agent tavaborole as a broad-spectrum serine and metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. Tavaborole was shown to enhance the antibacterial efficacy of various \u03b2-lactam antibiotics against bacteria producing either SBLs or MBLs, while also demonstrating good safety profiles. Mechanistic studies revealed that tavaborole inhibited SBLs by covalently binding to the serine catalytic residue at the active site of serine enzymes and inhibits MBLs by chelating the zinc ions in metalloenzymes. As a broad-spectrum serine and metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, tavaborole, in combination with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, offered a faster, safer, and more cost-effective treatment option for early management of infections caused by \u03b2-lactam-resistant pathogens. This highlighted the potential of benzoxaborole compounds as broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors.\n\n## Implications of all the available evidence\nThis study identified tavaborole as a broad-spectrum serine and metallo-\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor with significant clinical potential.\n\n## Introduction\n\u03b2-Lactam antibiotics are regarded as the safest and most efficacious antimicrobial agents for the clinical management of bacterial infections.1 Nevertheless, their extensive employment in clinical settings has precipitated a concerning trend: the relentless proliferation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In Gram-negative bacteria, the production of \u03b2-lactamases represents the predominant mechanism of \u03b2-lactam resistance.2 \u03b2-lactamases possess either an active serine residue at their active site, classifying them as SBLs (class A, C and D), or at least one catalytically functional divalent zinc ion, categorizing them as MBLs (class B).3 Among them, Classes A, B, and D include carbapenemases, particularly noteworthy for their ability to hydrolyse a broad spectrum of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, have emerged as a significant public health concern. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has designated carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as an urgent threat due to their capacity to cause severe infections and limited treatment options available.4\nThe development of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors is instrumental in preserving the therapeutic efficacy of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics against \u03b2-lactamase-producing pathogens. To date, the FDA has approved seven combinations of \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (Table 1). These combinations effectively target Class A serine carbapenemases, such as KPC. However, they remain ineffective against MBLs and also lack activity against problematic Class D enzymes in Acinetobacter baumannii, such as OXA-23.12 Hence, it is imperative to develop the broader-spectrum inhibitors capable of capturing these additional types of \u03b2-lactamases. Bicyclic boronate derivatives have demonstrated broad-spectrum inhibitory potential against both SBLs and MBLs. Their distinctiveness stems from their ability to mimic the anionic tetrahedral transition state that occurs during the catalytic hydrolysis of \u03b2-lactams by SBLs and chelate zinc ions at the active site of MBLs.13 Recently, two bicyclic boronates, taniborbactam (VNRX-5133) and xeruborbactam (QPX7728), have received considerable attention.Table 1FDA approved \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors.NameApproved year\u03b2-Lactam partnerSpectrum of inhibitionReferencesClass AClass AClass BClass CClass D(ESBLs)(KPC)(MBLs)(AmpC)(OXA-23)Clavulanic acid1984Amoxicillin\u221a\u2013\u2013\u2013\u20135Sulbactam1987Ampicillin\u221a\u2013\u2013\u2013\u20136Tazobactam1993Piperacillin\u221a\u2013\u2013\u2013\u20137Tazobactam2014Ceftolozane\u221a\u2013\u2013\u2013\u20138Avibactam2015Ceftazidime\u221a\u221a\u2013\u221a\u221a9Vaborbactam2017Meropenem\u221a\u221a\u2013\u221a\u201310Relebactam2019Imipenem\u221a\u221a\u2013\u221a\u201311\u221a, useful inhibitory activity shown; \u2013, no useful inhibitory activity shown; ESBLs, extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases; MBLs, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases.\nThese compounds possess a bicyclic structure and a carboxyl group analogous to those found in \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, allowing them to replicate the initial binding mode of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics to the active sites of SBLs and MBLs, therefore exhibiting potent inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of \u03b2-lactamases. In present, the combination of xeruborbactam and meropenem has completed Phase I clinical trials, while taniborbactam combined with cefepime has shown promising results in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, with strong potential for FDA approval pending additional chemistry, manufacturing, and control data (Table 2).14,17 The success of taniborbactam validates the feasibility of developing broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors and demonstrates its effectiveness in combating infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, due to the complexity of its synthesis, future research should prioritize developing broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors that are simper to manufacture.Table 2The promising \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors under clinical investigation.NamePhase\u03b2-Lactam partnerSpectrum of inhibitionReferencesClass AClass AClass BClass CClass D(ESBLs)(KPC)(MBLs)(AmpC)(OXA)TaniborbactamPhase III trials finishedCefepime\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a14,15,16XeroborbactamPhase I trials finishedMeropenem\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a12,17\u221a, useful inhibitory activity shown; SBLs, extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases; MBLs, metallo-\u03b2-lactamases.\nCompared to the new drug development, screening existing drug libraries based on target or phenotypic approaches can reduce the duration of the preclinical research phase for candidate drugs. Moreover, using established pharmacokinetic properties and safety profiles can effectively mitigate the risk of failure in clinical studies.18 Therefore, we reasoned that the identification of potential \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors within the FDA drug library represents a promising strategy for overcoming antibiotic resistance. To this end, we evaluated the synergistic antibacterial effects of meropenem in combination with a range of FDA-approved drugs, and discovered that tavaborole, a benzoxaborole antifungal drug, exhibited synergistic antibacterial activity when combined with multiple \u03b2-lactam antibiotics against bacterial pathogens producing SBLs (class A and D) and MBLs (class B). Mechanistic studies indicated that tavaborole, akin to other bicyclic boron-containing compounds, binds to the catalytic pockets of SBLs and MBLs. This interaction effectively restores the antibacterial activity of meropenem both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, the administration of the injection demonstrated favourable safety profiles in mice. Overall, tavaborole is a promising broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor.\n\n## Bacterial strains and materials\nThe bacterial strains used in this study include Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883, and the engineered strains BW25113::pUC19-blaNDM-5, ATCC 13883::pUC19-blaNDM-5 and ATCC 13883::pUC19-blaKPC-2, as described in Supplementary Table S1. Other tested blaNDM-5 and blaKPC-2 -positive strains isolated from animals or humans are listed in Supplementary Table S3. Unless otherwise noted, all of the strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB). Tavaborole (Cat No. T3349, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) was obtained from Shanghai Topscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China. All antibiotics were purchased from the China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control. All media were purchased from Beijing Land Bridge Technology Co., Ltd. The Isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (Cat No. ST1416), PEG 400 (Cat No. ST2589) His-tag Protein Purification Kit (Cat No. P2247S) and enhanced bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Cat No. P0010) were obtained from Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China.\n\n## Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination\nThe MIC values were determined by microbroth dilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI).19 In short, the drugs were serially diluted twofold in a 96-well microtiter plate containing Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB). Subsequently, an equal volume (100 \u03bcL) of a bacterial suspension standardized to 1.0\u20131.5 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL was added into each well. The plates were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 16\u201318 h. The MIC value was determined as the lowest concentration of the compound that inhibited visible bacterial growth. Each bacterial strain was tested at least in triplicate. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as the quality control strain.\n\n## Primary screening of meropenem adjuvants\nIn MHB medium supplemented with a final concentration of 1/4 MIC of meropenem, a range of FDA-approved drugs was introduced at predefined concentrations (10 \u03bcM). Overnight bacterial culture (BW25113::pUC19-blaNDM-5) was suspended and dispensed in a microtiter plate, yielding a final load of 1 \u00d7 106 cells per well. The MHB medium containing 1/4 \u00d7 MIC and 2 \u00d7 MIC of meropenem functioned as positive and negative controls, respectively. The microplates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h, and the bacterial growth (OD600nm) was recorded using an Infinite M200 plate reader. The \u03b8 value was introduced to define the interaction between meropenem and the FDA-approved drugs used. \u03b8 = [1 \u2212 (ODsample \u2212 ODbackground)/(ODcontrol \u2212 ODbackground)], where synergy was operationally defined as a \u03b8 value \u2265 1.20 The initial screening procedure was independently replicated twice.\n\n## Checkerboard assay\nTo better understand the synergistic antibacterial effect between \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and tavaborole, the checkerboard assay was employed to determine the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI), with minor modifications as previously described.21 Briefly, 100 \u03bcL of MH broth containing serially diluted antibiotics and tavaborole was dispensed into each well of a 96-well plate. Subsequently, 1.6 \u00d7 106 CFU/mL of bacteria were inoculated into the same plate, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h OD600nm was measured using an Infinite M200 plate reader. The FICI was calculated using the formula: FICI = (MIC_A combination/MIC_A alone) + (MIC_B combination/MIC_B alone). FICI values of \u22640.5, 0.5\u20132, and >2 were defined as synergistic, indifferent, and antagonistic effects, respectively.22\n\n## Construction, expression and purification of NDM-5 and KPC-2\nThe blaNDM-5 and blaKPC-2 genes were obtained from E. coli 15NN1 and K. pneumoniae K154, respectively, and cloned into the expression vector pET-28a (+) by Gibson Assembly. Protein expression and purification were performed according to a previous study.23 Briefly, the plasmids pET-28a included blaNDM-5 and blaKPC-2 were transformed into E. coli BL21 by chemical transformation. Cultures of E. coli BL21 containing the pET-28a vector were grown to an OD600nm of 0.6 at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 200 rpm. Following this, isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce protein expression. The cultures were then incubated overnight at 16 \u00b0C with shaking at 200 rpm. Bacterial cells were harvested and lysed using a lysis buffer. Protein purification was performed using a His-tag Protein Purification Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The purity and concentration of the recombinant proteins were assessed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and an enhanced bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1).\n\n## Enzyme inhibition assay\nEnzyme inhibition assays were conducted using a 96-well plate at room temperature with an Infinite M200 plate reader. Enzyme concentrations were set at 20 nM for NDM-5 and 30 nM for KPC-2. The substrate, meropenem, was utilized at concentrations of 60 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM, respectively. Tavaborole concentrations ranged from 1 to 1000 \u03bcM, while EDTA and avibactam (positive control) were used at concentrations spanning from 100 to 0.1 \u03bcM and 1 to 0.001 \u03bcM, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). All enzymes and substrates were diluted in HEPES buffer. The enzymes and test compounds were pre-incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequent, the reaction was initiated by adding the substrate. Reaction progress was monitored by measuring fluorescence intensity at OD300nm. Data fitting and IC50 value determination were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 software.\n\n## Ki measurement method\nKi measurements were conducted in a 96-well plate at room temperature using an Infinite M200 plate reader. NDM-5 and KPC-2 enzymes, along with tavaborole, were diluted in HEPES buffer. For the assays, tavaborole was used at final concentrations of 0, 100, 200 \u03bcM for NDM-5 and 0, 2.5, 5.0 \u03bcM for KPC-2. EDTA and avibactam (as positive controls) were used at concentrations of 0, 0.1, and 1 \u03bcM for NDM-5, and 0, 0.25, and 0.5 \u03bcM for KPC-2. Samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Substrate concentration of meropenem varied between 12.5 and 500 mM depending on the concentration of tavaborole. The reaction progress was monitored by measuring fluorescence intensity at OD300nm. Lineweaver-Burke plots were generated for each concentration of tavaborole, along with double reciprocal plots of the reaction rate against substrate concentration. The Ki values were calculated using GraphPad Prisim 9.3.1 software to determine the inhibition type of tavaborole on NDM-5 and KPC-2 enzymes.\n\n## Silico docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nMolecular docking studies of MBL (NDM-5) and SBLs (KPC-2, AmpC and OXA-23) with inhibitors were conducted using the Dock module of MOE 2020 and the Covalent docking module of Schrodinger Maestro 2022-2 program, respectively. This work was supported by Shanghai Topscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Tavaborole, EDTA, QPX7728, bicyclic boronate compound 17b, and C9P were prepared using the Discovery Studio Viewer 2022. The complex structures of KPC-2 (PDB ID: 6V1J), NDM-5 (PDB ID: 6MGY), AmpC (PDB ID: 4KZ4), and OXA-23 (PDB ID: 4JF4) were downloaded from the PDB database. The active site of MBL and SBLs was designated as the docking binding site. Docking pose predictions of MBL and SBLs with inhibitors were performed using the GBVI/WAS and Goldscore scoring function. All docking results were visualized using the PyMOL 2.6.0 program. The highest-scoring docking poses were selected for MD simulations using Gromacs 5.1 software, with each simulation running for 200 ns. Following the completion of the simulations, the resulting trajectories were analysed utilizing VMD 1.9.3, PyMOL, and the suite of Gromacs analysis tools, in accordance with established protocols.24 The binding free energy of SBLs with inhibitors was calculated from the molecular dynamic trajectories using the MM/GBSA method.\n\n## Safety evaluation of intraperitoneal administration of tavaborole\nFor the safety evaluation, female BALB/c mice, aged 6\u20138 weeks and weighing approximately 20 g, were divided into 6 groups, with 6 mice in each group. Before the experiment, the mice were weighed, and tavaborole was diluted to concentrations of 150 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg based on their body weight, with 30% PEG 400 as the solvent. Both a solvent control group and a PBS control group were included in the study. Each mouse received an intraperitoneal injection of 200 \u03bcL of tavaborole. Post-injection, the mice were given access to normal drinking water and maintenance feed daily. The mice were weighed regularly, and survival rates were calculated.\nAnother cohort of mice, maintained under the same conditions, had blood samples collected at 24 h and 7 days post-injection for complete blood count (CBC) and biochemical analyses. The CBC parameters included red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), haemoglobin (HGB), haematocrit (HCT), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The biochemical tests measured total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), alanine transaminase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (CREA), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG).\n\n## Mice intraperitoneal infection assays\nThe intraperitoneal infection experiment utilized female BALB/c mice, aged 6\u20138 weeks and weighing approximately 20 g. The bacterial strains employed were NDM-5-producing E. coli 15NN1 and KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae K154. The mice were randomly assigned to one of eight groups, with 6 mice in each group: a solvent control group, a meropenem monotherapy group (8 mg/kg), a tavaborole monotherapy group (16 mg/kg or 32 mg/kg), and a combination therapy group (8 mg/kg meropenem + 16 mg/kg tavaborole or 8 mg/kg meropenem + 32 mg/kg tavaborole. For a detailed description of the dosage determination, please refer to Supplementary Text S1. Each mouse received an intraperitoneal injection of bacterial suspension containing 5 \u00d7 108 CFU of 15NN1 or 7.5 \u00d7 106 CFU of K154, followed by intraperitoneal administration of the designated drugs 0.5 h later. For additional details on the timing of administration, please refer to Supplementary Text S2. The mice were observed daily for survival over a period of 7 days, and survival curves were generated using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 software.\nAdditionally, another cohort of mice, treated under the same conditions, had their major intraperitoneal organs (liver, spleen, and kidneys) harvested 48 h post-treatment for further analysis. These organs were subjected to both plating counts and histopathological examination. For histopathological analysis, the organs were sectioned, paraffin-embedded, deparaffinized, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, dehydrated, and mounted for microscopic examination and image analysis.\n\n## Ethics\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare and Research Ethics Committee of China Agricultural University (approval number: SQ2022YFD1800019) and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines provided by the committee.\n\n## Statistics\nGraphPad Prism 9.3.1 was used for data processing. All data were presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (s.d.). The statistical significance was determined by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant.\n\n## Role of funders\nThe funders had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, or in the writing of the paper. The authors had full access to all the data in the study and accept responsibility to submit for publication.\n\n## Tavaborole is a potential ultrabroad-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases inhibitor\nTo address the urgent need for clinically effective inhibitors for \u03b2-lactamases, specifically MBLs, we conducted a comprehensive screening of 1718 FDA-approved drugs to identify agents that show synergistic antibacterial activity with meropenem. Using a \u03b8 value = 1.0 as the cut-off, 69 compounds (4.0%) showed synergistic activity with meropenem (Supplementary Fig. S3). A subsequent assessment using the checkerboard assay revealed that 10 drugs (69%) combined with meropenem achieved FICI values \u2264 0.5 (Supplementary Table S2). Considering effect, toxicity and cost, the antifungal agent tavaborole was selected for further study (\u03b8 = 1.01, FICI = 0.5, Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S2). We further used \u03b2-lactamase-free strain K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, the engineered strains expressing either MBL (ATCC 13883::pUC19-blaNDM-5) or SBL (ATCC 13883::pUC19-blaKPC-2), and clinical-derived NDM-5-producing E. coli 15NN1 and KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae K154, and demonstrated the synergistic bactericidal effects of combination of tavaborole and meropenem against strains producing both MBL and SBL (FICI \u22640.5, Fig. 1). No synergistic effect was observed against \u03b2-lactamase-free ATCC 13883 (FICI >1), implying that the potentiation mechanisms of tavaborole may relate to the inhibition of \u03b2-lactamases activity. Therefore, we further assessed the synergistic activity of both tavaborole and meropenem on clinical and animal-derived bacterial isolates producing either MBLs (NDM, IMP, and VIM) or SBLs (KPC and OXA), and demonstrated that the drug combination exhibited synergistic effects against the majority of tested strains producing either MBLs or SBLs (32/37 86.5%, FICI \u22640.5; 5/37 13.5%, FICI <0.62, additive effects), and reduced the MIC of meropenem for tested strains by 4- to 16-fold (Supplementary Table S3, Fig. 2a). Specifically, the drug combination exhibited synergistic activity against three MBLs across all tested bacterial species, reducing the MIC of meropenem to NDM-producing and IMP-/VIM-producing bacteria by 16- and 4-fold, respectively. It also exhibited a more pronounced synergistic effect against class A SBLs (KPC-2 and -93) than class D SBLs (OXA-10, -23, and -232). The drug combination showed highest level of synergistic activity against KPC-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/4 75%, FICI \u22640.25, 1/4 25%, FICI = 0.5), whilst only an additive effect for OXA-232-producing K. pneumoniae (FICI = 0.56).Fig. 1The combined antibacterial effect of tavaborole and meropenem. (a) Chemical structure of tavaborole. Checkerboard broth microdilution assays were performed to evaluate the synergistic activity between meropenem and tavaborole against standard strains (b)K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883-pUC19-blaNDM-5, (c) ATCC 13883-pUC19-blaKPC-2, (d) ATCC 13883, and clinical strains (e)E. coli_15NN1-blaNDM-5, (f)K. pneumoniae_K154- blaKPC-2.Fig. 2The combined antibacterial effect of tavaborole and \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials. The synergistic activity of (a) tavaborole and meropenem combination against Gram-negative bacteria producing different types of \u03b2-lactamases, (b) tavaborole in combination with different \u03b2-lactam antibiotics against carbapenem-resistant bacteria (blaNDM-5 positive E. coli 15NN1 and blaKPC-2 positive K. pneumoniae K154).\nTo investigate the synergistic bactericidal effects of tavaborole with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics other than meropenem, we employed a checkerboard assay to evaluate the combined effects of \u03b2-lactams with tavaborole against NDM-5-positive E. coli 15NN1 and KPC-2-positive K. pneumoniae K154. Synergistic effects against both strains were observed when tavaborole was combined with second-, third-, and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams (Supplementary Table S4 and Fig. 2b). The best synergistic bactericidal effects were observed when tavaborole was combined with carbapenems and monobactams, with a FICI value of 0.25 for meropenem against 15NN1, and FICI values of 0.28 for ertapenem and aztreonam against K154. Among the four first-generation cephalosporins, only cefalotin and cefapirin exhibited synergistic effects with tavaborole against E. coli 15NN1, whereas they showed additive effects against K. pneumoniae K154 (FICI \u22640.75). Except for procaine penicillin, the other seven penicillin types demonstrated additive effects with tavaborole against both strains (FICI \u22641). Additionally, we evaluated the effects of three other benzoxaborole compounds, AN-2718, crisaborole, and epetraborole, in combination with meropenem against strains producing NDM-5 (15NN1) and KPC-2 (K154). AN-2718 and meropenem demonstrated synergistic bactericidal activity against both 15NN1 and K154 (FICI = 0.19, Supplementary Fig. S4). Conversely, crisaborole (FICI = 0.16) and epetraborole (FICI = 0.5) exhibited synergistic effects with meropenem exclusively against the K154 strain (Supplementary Fig. S4), while they produced only additive effects against the 15NN1 strain (FIC \u22641). These results suggested that benzoborazole compounds, particularly tavaborole, may possess potential as an ultrabroad-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases inhibitor.\n\n## Mechanism of the interaction between tavaborole and MBLs/SBLs\nWe first evaluated whether tavaborole enhanced meropenem efficacy by inhibiting \u03b2-lactamases activity. After expressing and purifying the representative MBL (NDM-5) and SBL (KPC-2) enzymes in E. coli BL21, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of tavaborole was determined. The results showed a dose-dependent reduction in meropenem absorbance at OD300nm, indicating that tavaborole inhibited the enzymatic activities of NDM-5 and KPC-2 with IC50 values of 3 and 0.17 \u03bcg/mL (19.6 and 1.1 \u03bcM), respectively (Fig. 3a, c). To further investigate the inhibitory mechanism, we determined the inhibition constants Ki against NDM-5 and KPC-2. The Ki values for tavaborole against NDM-5 and KPC-2 were 59 and 0.88 \u03bcg/mL (388.4 and 5.8 \u03bcM), respectively. Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated a competitive inhibition pattern of tavaborole against both NDM-5 and KPC-2 enzymes (Fig. 3b, d).Fig. 3The mechanism of the interaction between tavaborole, NDM-5 and KPC-2.

(i) and (j) RMSD and RMSF analyses of the tavaborole-NDM-5 and tavaborole-KPC-2 complexes during MD simulation.\nTo further elucidate the binding modes of tavaborole with MBL and SBLs, we performed in silico docking analyses with NDM-5 (MBL, Class B) and KPC-2, AmpC, and OXA-23 (SBLs, Classes A, C, and D). Tavaborole localized within the catalytic pockets of both MBL and SBLs, similar to reference compounds (EDTA, QPX7728, bicyclic boronate compound 17b, and C9P), with comparable binding scores and free energies (Fig. 3e, f, Supplementary Fig. S6). Specifically, tavaborole formed a coordination bond with Zn2+ in NDM-5 and covalently bonded with a key serine residue in the SBL catalytic domain. For example, the boron atom of tavaborole formed a covalent bond with the serine residue (Ser70) in the active site of KPC-2 and hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues (Ser70, Ser130, and Thr237), resembling the tetrahedral transition state in antibiotic hydrolysis, leading to competitive inhibition.\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations further confirmed the stability of these binding modes. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) are critical indicators used to evaluate structural deviations and stability in MD simulations. In our study, RMSD values stabilized around 0.15 nm for NDM-5 and 0.18 nm for KPC-tavaborole (Fig. 3i). Apart from the terminal regions and certain loop structures, the RMSF for the main structures of NDM-5 and KPC-2-tavaborole remained relatively low, fluctuating between approximately 0.1 nm and 0.4 nm, respectively (Fig. 3j). The physicochemical properties of tavaborole in NDM-5-tavaborole complex also demonstrated notable stability throughout the simulation, with RMSD, RMSF, solvent-accessible surface area, and radius of gyration remaining consistently stable (Supplementary Fig. S5). Structural clustering analysis of the simulation trajectories showed that the NDM-5-tavaborole complex was categorized into 437 distinct clusters, with the largest cluster comprising 77 structures, while the KPC-2-tavaborole complex formed a single cluster containing 2000 structures. Representative structures identified in the clustering analysis exhibited a high degree of consistency with the original configurations (Fig. 3g and h). This structural comparison, along with observed RMSD variations, suggested no significant changes in the secondary structure of the enzymes throughout the simulations. Further, stable coordination interactions between tavaborole and the NDM-5, as well as covalent and hydrogen bonds with KPC-2, were consistently maintained (Fig. 3g and h). Collectively, these findings indicated that tavaborole could stably bind to both MBLs and SBLs, effectively inhibiting their enzymatic activities, making it a potent broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor.\n\n## Injection administration of tavaborole demonstrated favourable safety profiles in mice\nTavaborole has been approved by the FDA exclusively for the topical treatment of onychomycosis.25 However, we propose that its use as an injectable could enhance the effectiveness of meropenem against systemic infections. Given that different routes of drug administration can lead to distinct toxicological responses,26 we assessed the safety profile of tavaborole\u2019s intraperitoneal administration in a mice model. Mice administered varying concentrations of tavaborole displayed normal neurological status and behavioural activities compared to the control group. The survival rate was 100% across all groups within 7 days. Aside from a slight decrease in body weight in the 150 mg/kg group on day 2 (p < 0.05) and the 50 mg/kg group on day 6 (p < 0.01), no significant differences in body weight were observed across the groups (Supplementary Fig. S7a, p > 0.05). Additionally, blood samples were collected on days 1 and 7 post-administration for complete blood count and biochemical analyses. The blood parameters (RB",
