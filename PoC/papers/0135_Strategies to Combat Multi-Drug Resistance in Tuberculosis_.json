  "abstract": "\"Drug resistance is an unavoidable consequence of the use of drugs; however, the emergence of multi-drug resistance can be managed by accurate diagnosis and tailor-made regimens.\"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), is one of the most paramount health perils that has emerged in the 21st century. The global increase in drug-resistant strains of various bacterial pathogens prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop a priority list of AMR pathogens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), an acid-fast bacillus that causes tuberculosis (TB), merits being one of the highest priority pathogens on this list since drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) accounts for \u223c29% of deaths attributable to AMR. In recent years, funded collaborative efforts of researchers from academia, not-for-profit virtual R&D organizations and industry have resulted in the continuous growth of the TB drug discovery and development pipeline. This has so far led to the accelerated regulatory approval of bedaquiline and delamanid for the treatment of DR-TB. However, despite the availability of drug regimes, the current cure rate for multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treatment regimens is 50% and 30%, respectively. It is to be noted that these regimens are administered over a long duration and have a serious side effect profile. Coupled with poor patient adherence, this has led to further acquisition of drug resistance and treatment failure. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new TB drugs with novel mechanism of actions (MoAs) and associated regimens.This Account recapitulates drug resistance in TB, existing challenges in addressing DR-TB, new drugs and regimens in development, and potential ways to treat DR-TB. We highlight our research aimed at identifying novel small molecule leads and associated targets against TB toward contributing to the global TB drug discovery and development pipeline. Our work mainly involves screening of various small molecule chemical libraries in phenotypic whole-cell based assays to identify hits for medicinal chemistry optimization, with attendant deconvolution of the MoA. We discuss the identification of small molecule chemotypes active against Mtb and subsequent structure-activity relationships (SAR) and MoA deconvolution studies. This is followed by a discussion on a chemical series identified by whole-cell cross-screening against Mtb, for which MoA deconvolution studies revealed a pathway that explained the lack of in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of TB and reiterated the importance of selecting an appropriate growth medium during phenotypic screening. We also discuss our efforts on drug repositioning toward addressing DR-TB. In the concluding section, we preview some promising future directions and the challenges inherent in advancing the drug pipeline to address DR-TB.",

Historically,\nTB was considered incurable until the discovery and use of streptomycin\n(STR) in 1946 (Figure 1). In the very first clinical trial conducted by the British Medical\nResearch Council (BMRC), STR showed an impressive reduction in mortality\nbut very soon resistance emerged to this drug.5 In the 1960s, a trial of isoniazid (INH)-para-aminosalicylic acid\n(PAS) was launched, which suggested that care in the home was equally\neffective and comparable to treatment in a sanatorium or hospital.6\nModern-day standard TB chemotherapy effective at treating drug-susceptible\n(DS) disease requires 6 months of administration using a combination\nregimen containing INH, rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), and\nethambutol (EMB). The emergence of HIV/TB comorbidity led to the declaration\nof TB as a global public health emergency by the World Health Organization\n(WHO) in 1993. This is further worsened by a rise in diabetes which\nresults in a more than 3-fold increase in the risk of TB, a bigger\nrisk than HIV in certain regions.7 However,\nthe most significant factor affecting this global health menace is\nthe emergence of drug resistance where the treatment runs up to 2\nyears in some cases with limited success and is accompanied by severe\ntoxicity. In this Account, we evaluate the challenges facing TB drug\ndiscovery and associated drug resistance, focusing on key insights\nand highlighting the outstanding questions. We also discuss how these\nmight be tackled. We conclude with a perspective on potential areas\nof future research in TB drug discovery focusing on circumventing\ndrug resistance.\n\n## Drug Resistant TB: A Challenge\nContrasting with other bacterial pathogens that have evolved to\nspread drug resistance in populations via horizontal gene transfer,\ndrug resistance in Mtb is mainly due to mutations\nin chromosomal genes (Table 1). This genotypic resistance may develop due to single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions or deletions in bacterial genes,\naffecting prodrug activation, modifications in the drug-target structure,\nreduced drug permeability, or increased efflux.8\u221210 However, and\ninterestingly, the development of resistance in Mtb is complex. It involves an interplay of clinical, biological, and\nmicrobiological processes, e.g., nonadherence of patients to the therapy11 leading to the development of genetic resistance,\ncomplexity of granulomas which presents a barrier to effective drug\ndistribution12 and thus limiting adequate\nsupply of drugs to Mtb, intrinsic resistance, phenotypic\nresistance exhibited by nonreplicating (NR) drug-tolerant bacteria,13 and acquired resistance. Drug-resistance in\nTB can be categorized in four categories: (i) Single drug-resistant\nTB (SDR-TB), where only one drug of the combination therapy is subject\nto resistance; (ii) multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), defined as the\nfailure to respond to at least RIF and INH; (iii) extensively drug-resistant\nTB (XDR-TB), when MDR-TB coupled with the resistance to at least one\nof the second-line drugs; and (iv) totally drug-resistant (TDR-TB),\nwhen all the available first- and second-line anti-TB drugs are ineffective.\nAt this juncture, it is noteworthy that, due to the limitations in\ndrug-susceptibility testing of second-line drugs for resistance, the\nWHO has yet to recognize TDR-TB.\nIn 2019, globally\nan estimated 10 million people fell ill with\nTB. There were \u223c1.2 million deaths recorded among HIV-negative\nand an additional 208\u202f000 deaths of HIV positive people due\nto TB in 2019.14 Although TB affects people\nof both sexes, in 2019 men showed the highest-burden and accounted\nfor 56%, women for 32%, and children (aged <15 years) for 12% of\nall TB cases. DR-TB continues to be a major threat. There were about\n0.5 million new cases of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB), and \u223c78%\nof these had MDR-TB. Globally, there were 3.3% of new TB cases and\n17.7% of previously treated cases that displayed MDR/RR-TB. A total\nof 12\u202f350 globally reported cases of XDR-TB echo the mayhem\nof drug resistance in TB. The WHO has mandated Mtb drug susceptibility testing (DST) for all TB patients to better\nguide treatment decisions and improve treatment outcomes. However,\nthe availability of resources in high burden countries remains a major\nproblem. Traditionally, phenotypic drug susceptibility testing is\nthe first choice for the diagnosis of MDR/XDR-TB, but it can take\n\u223c12 weeks to deliver results which directly affects effective\ntreatment due to the delay in initiating therapy. Toward this, a single\ndiagnostic test involving all possible mutations in the resistance\ngenes\u2019 profile would be the ultimate assay. And this fast and\naccurate diagnosis should subsequently result in effective treatment\nand reduction in resistance development. However, DR-TB may also spread\nwhen a new infection occurs with a resistant Mtb strain,\nunderscoring the prevention of treatment failure to stop the spread\nof MDR/XDR infections.15\u221217 For the effective treatment of DR-TB, the WHO has\nissued recommendations with regard to drug combinations to be used,\nlength of treatment, and how patient response should be monitored.18 The MDR/RR-TB regimens can be offered as either\n(i) a standardized shorter regimen of 9\u201312 months or (ii) longer\nregimens of up to 20 months.\n\n## Drugs and Regimens in Development\nAdequate treatment of DR-TB can prevent further development of\nnew DR strains, which can worsen the current situation of poor prognosis\nand limited therapeutic options. Current second- and third-line anti-TB\ndrugs are more toxic, less efficacious, and more expensive than first-line\ndrugs. In light of this, the most important step toward the management\nof DR-TB is the use of an efficacious drug regimen, derived directly\nfrom the drug-susceptibility testing outcomes. This testing needs\nto be rapid in order to identify DR-TB which can allow for an immediate\nprescription of a specific drug regimen. Two recently approved anti-TB\ndrugs, bedaquiline and delamanid, are used in many countries to treat\nMDR-TB when no other option is available. However, due to severe side\neffects and emergence of resistance to these, there is an urgent need\nfor novel drugs and regimens.19 Regimens\ninvolving new drugs would be a dual feat toward achieving DR-TB treatment,\nas these would reduce the current requirement of drug-susceptibility\ntesting. It is interesting to note that global efforts for TB treatment\nhave dramatically evolved in the recent past (Table 2). A number of new anti-TB agents and repurposed\ndrugs are under clinical development as shown in the pipeline (Figure 2).14,20\n\n## DR-TB:\nHow Can We Intervene?\nAs highlighted in Figure 1 and Table 1, resistance to newly discovered drugs has\ngenerally developed within\n10 years of their first use. Genetic resistance to the drug is an\nevolutionary process in response to the selection pressure of the\ndrug(s) that reinforces the need to continue optimizing new drug(s)\nand associated regimens. New vulnerable drug targets with at least\nthree levels of validation, i.e., genetic, phenotypic, and in vivo,\ncan be a basis for confronting DR-TB. In parallel, considering the\nhost environment, identifying compounds targeting Mtb residing in granulomas/cavities is of interest. In addition, a micromanaged\nantibiotic stewardship strategy can be effective in slowing down the\nemergence of resistance. However, understanding antibiotic resistance\nin Mtb is not straightforward (Figure 3). Resistance can appear as a result of a\npersistent phenotype, which is displayed by drug-tolerant populations\nof Mtb known as persisters. These appear to be nonreplicating\nor slowly growing due to reduced metabolic activity and carry noninheritable\nphenotypic resistance. Multiple pathways can be involved in evolving\npersisters, such as energy metabolism, regulators, toxin-antitoxin\nsystem, and transporter or efflux mechanisms. Therefore, an understanding\nof persistence/dormancy/tolerance in Mtb may direct\nthe rational development of new treatment regimens.21 Management of this tolerant/persister population would\nsignificantly slow down the development of drug resistance which will\nhelp in TB treatment shortening. However, it remains a challenge because\ndrug-tolerant populations are generally tolerant of all drugs. Recent\nadvances have seen the establishment of various in vitro models representing\nthe nonreplicating or tolerant state. These models include low pH,\nhypoxia, nutrient starvation, carbon starvation, and a recently developed\nrapid, low pH nutrient stress to facilitate understanding of the physiology\nof the tolerant population and a quick determination of the bactericidal\nactivity of test compounds.22 Also, induction\nof alternative pathways of prodrug activation can be a viable mechanism\nfor neutralizing drug resistance, as exemplified by the SMARt-420\n(Small Molecules Aborting Resistance) that stimulates ethionamide\nactivity and reverses EthA-mediated resistance.23\n\n## Addressing Drug Resistant TB: Our Approach\nAs described above, most of the current drugs in clinical development\nfor TB are derivatives of existing drug classes. To identify new chemical\nstarting points for drug discovery, the target-based screening approach\nis preferred when target validation has been demonstrated. Selecting\nthe target mainly relies on its vulnerability and selectivity. Interestingly,\ndespite tremendous success in other disease areas, this approach was\nlargely not successful in TB drug discovery due to compound permeability\nissues across the lipid-rich cell-wall, efflux, and metabolization\nof the compound in Mtb. On the other hand, the phenotypic\nwhole-cell screening approach has relatively been more successful\nin delivering cell-permeable small molecules active against whole Mtb cells as starting points for TB drug discovery. This\nis then typically followed up by deconvolution of the MoA of the actives.\nOur program has largely utilized this approach with small molecule\nactive hits being progressed through the drug discovery process, underpinned\nby medicinal chemistry optimization, toward improving potency, pharmacokinetic,\nand pharmacodynamic properties. A critical benchmark in selecting\na \u201cNew Chemical Entity\u201d from the screening campaign\nis the representation of a new drug class, acting via a novel MoA.\nTo achieve this, we typically perform hit-triaging at an early stage\nto avoid rediscovery of the established targets by using a slew of\nsecondary assays. The blueprint of our early drug discovery approach\nis summarized in the test cascade (Figure 4). Our whole-cell based phenotypic screening\nassesses the growth kinetics by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration\n(MIC) as the end point. As the libraries of small polar molecules\noffer a significant edge by occupying a unique chemical space of MW\n(<250 Da) and lipophilicity (clogP < 2.5) in TB drug discovery,\nwe screened such and several other libraries. Moreover, we have learned\nthe importance of target deconvolution studies in order to drive successful\nstructure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) exploration. For this\nreason, we typically initiate target identification work in parallel\nwith medicinal chemistry hit optimization studies.\nIn this context, whole-cell screening of a small polar library\nof \u223c6000 compounds in a novel chemical space (Mw 150\u2013350\nDa, clogP \u22121 to 3.5; assembled by Novartis Institute for Tropical\nDiseases (NITD)) identified a potent hit compound, the pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1,3(2H)-dione 1 (Figures 5 and 6).1 Subsequent resynthesis, retesting,\nand ADME profiling confirmed the good in vitro potency (<0.15 \u03bcM)\nagainst Mtb. However, the ester functionality raised\nconcerns about its metabolic instability as less than 20% of the compound\nremained after 30 min of incubation with human, rat, and mouse liver\nmicrosomes. Therefore, the initial medicinal chemistry strategy was\naimed at improving the metabolic liability of compound 1 while maintaining good anti-Mtb activity by identifying\nbioisosteric replacements for the labile ester. The SAR produced 1,2,4-oxadiazole 1a with improved metabolic stability (HLM/RLM/MLM; % remaining,\n57/100/98) over ester 1 (HLM/RLM/MLM; % remaining, 14/19/18)\nand significant anti-Mtb activity (0.62 \u03bcM).\nAdditional SAR exploration delivered compound 1b with\ngood in vitro metabolic stability and excellent potency of the hit\ncompound 1. Next, in order to investigate the MoA of\npyrrolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1,3(2H)-diones,\nwe explored a chemo-genetic approach by attempting to raise spontaneous-resistant\nmutants (SRMs) in Mtb. SRM generation attempts were\nunsuccessful even when the bacterial cultures were exposed to compounds\nat a concentration of 2\u2013200\u00d7 MIC. Nonetheless, the hit-triaging\nof the series showed that the compounds are hyperactive to a nonessential\ncytochrome bd oxidase deletion mutant (\u0394cydKO). This led us to screen the compounds against a QcrB\n(Ala317Thr) mutant of Mtb; QcrB is an essential subunit\nof respiratory cytochrome bc1 complex and the target of telacebec (Q203), that has completed\nphase-2 clinical trials with promising results (ClinicalTrials.gov:\nNCT03563599).24,25 Compounds in the series showed\nresistance to the QcrB point mutant; therefore, in conjunction with\nthe hyperactivity to the \u0394cydKO, this strongly\nsuggested that the pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1,3(2H)-diones target the QcrB subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex. Next, to determine the clinical\npotential of this series, we evaluated the activity of this series\nagainst DS Mtb clinical isolates belonging to different\nlineages such as atypical Beijing, Haarlem, Cas 1/Delhi, and X families.\nThe tested compounds were equally effective against all the strains\nwith an MIC90 of 0.08\u20130.6 \u03bcM. Although, we\ncould not test this series against DR clinical isolates it is to be\nnoted that QcrB inhibitors are equally effective against DR isolates.24,26\nA SoftFocus library27 comprising 35\u202f000\ncompounds represented by >200 scaffolds that had primarily been\ndesigned\nto target specific gene families, including kinases, G-protein coupled\nreceptors, and ion channels, was acquired. High-throughput screening\nagainst Mtb was carried out in Middlebrook 7H9 medium\nunder aerobic conditions and glucose as a carbon source. Two hit series,\none based on aminopyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines and\nthe other based on 6-dialkylaminopyrimidine carboxamides, were selected\nbased on the potency, intellectual property overlap, and chemical-structural\nproperties. As described above, the biology triage process facilitated\nthe exclusion of compounds acting on promiscuous targets such as QcrB,\nMmpL3, and DprE1 as well as DNA damaging agents. In the aminopyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine series,28 our medicinal\nchemistry efforts were focused on substitution with a variety of amino\ngroups in the 7-position and aryl groups in the 3-position (compound 2, Figure 5). This yielded compound 2a with an MIC99 of 1.25 \u03bcM (vs original hit of 5 \u03bcM). However, this\nseries exhibited liabilities of poor aqueous solubility and in vitro\ncytotoxicity. The series did not show MIC modulation against the tested\nmutant and reporter strains which is suggestive of the involvement\nof a novel MoA. In the 6-dialkylaminopyrimidine carboxamide series,2 compound 3 was identified as a suitable\nhit with a moderate potency of 20 \u03bcM (MIC), low toxicity (VERO\ncell-line, IC50 of 287 \u03bcM), but poor kinetic solubility\n(<5 \u03bcM) linked to the high lipophilicity and flat aromatic\ncharacter of the molecule. To improve the properties, a detailed SAR\nfocusing on understanding key hydrogen bond donor\u2013acceptor\ninteractions critical for activity, shape, and size of the central\ncore and scope for substitution/modification on either side of the\nmolecule was used (Figures 5 and 6). Additionally, the possibility\nof the addition of heteroatoms or polar groups was also investigated\nto reduce the lipophilicity, poor physicochemical properties, and\nstructure alerts, e.g., presence of potentially AMES positive anilines\nupon cleavage of the amide group. This effort resulted in potency\nimprovement (compound 3a, 0.78 \u03bcM from 20 \u03bcM)\nbut not solubility. Nonetheless, the detailed SAR demonstrated limitations\nas well as scope for further optimization of the series. The biology\nhit-triaging suggested involvement of a novel MoA. In order to supplement\nour MoA identification efforts, we raised a SRM with a distinct resistance\nphenotype against compound 3b. The 3b-resistant\nmutant did not exhibit cross-resistance to the standard TB drugs,\nsuggesting a potential novel MoA for the series. Unfortunately, whole-genome\nsequencing of the mutant did not reveal any genetic polymorphism(s)\nsuggestive of the target or MoA. Most of the analogues from the series\nwere cross-resistant against this mutant except the thiadiazole analogue 3c, indicating additional targets and/or a different MoA.\nGiven the failure to identify genetic polymorphisms in the raised\nmutant, we considered an alternative target identification approach\nand accordingly decided on chemoproteomics, using Mycobacterium\nbovis BCG cell lysate. The compound 3d was profiled\non 3e-immobilized beads. Subsequent affinity analyses\nsuggested that the potential target could be BCG_3193 (Rv3169) with\nan apparent Kd value of 0.7 \u03bcM and\na second weaker target BCG_3827 (Rv3768) with an apparent Kd value of 3.8 \u03bcM. The series was equally\neffective against the clinical strains of Mtb clinical\nisolates belonging to different lineages, exhibiting the MIC90 of 0.08\u20135 \u03bcM.\nNext, a high-throughput screen\nof a Medicines for Malaria Venture\n(MMV) compound library comprising an \u223c530\u202f000 diverse\nset of compounds against Mtb was conducted at the\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIAID/NIH). The reconfirmed hits were profiled\nfor MIC on multiple media conditions which identified a cluster of\npyrazolylpyrimidinones represented by compounds 4 and 5 (Figures 5 and 6). Detailed SAR investigation resulted\nin improving the activity against Mtb, moderate to\nhigh aqueous solubility, and excellent in vitro microsomal stability.\nHowever, there was a narrow scope to improve the selectivity index\nagainst mammalian cell-line toxicity. Therefore, further optimization\nof pharmacokinetic properties along with improved mammalian cytotoxicity\nwas needed to identify a compound suitable for in vivo efficacy studies.\nThe compounds were bactericidal against replicating Mtb and retained good potency against clinical isolates, within 4-fold\nrange of MICs against drug-sensitive Mtb strain.\nTranscription analyses of Mtb cultures treated with\npyrazolylpyrimidinones revealed the upregulation of genes involved\nin iron-homeostasis. This was further verified by iron supplementation\nto the growth medium displaying increase in the MIC values, suggesting\nthe perturbation of Fe-homeostasis as a MoA.3\nIn continuation of our TB drug discovery efforts, a whole-cell\ncross-screening against Mtb identified the 2-aminoquinazolinone\nseries as an attractive chemotype to prosecute.4 Originally, the 2-aminoquinazolinones were synthesized\nfor evaluation against the human malaria parasite Plasmodium\nfalciparum, based on their structural similarity to a previously\ndiscovered antimalarial 2-aminopyridine series in our lab.29 The hit compound 6 exhibited good\nin vitro potency against Mtb but low solubility (MIC,\n0.24 \u03bcM; solubility, <5 \u03bcM). The SAR investigation\nresulted in the identification of compound 7 with an\nimproved solubility while maintaining potency (Figures 5 and 6). However,\nthis series was not efficacious in a BALB/c mouse acute TB infection\nmodel despite the favorable pharmacokinetics profile. This intriguing\ndiscrepancy between in vitro vs in vivo efficacy was investigated\nthoroughly and found that this series was displaying a glycerol-medium\ndependent effect. Our MoA investigation efforts, involving SRM generation\nand whole-genome sequencing studies, validated this as point mutations\nmapped to glycerol metabolizing genes. This further reiterates the\nneed for caution during screening, that one should consider the major\ndifference in carbon metabolism between bacteria growing in standard\nTB culture medium containing glycerol compared to those found in TB-infected\nlungs.26\nAdditionally, one of the\nstrategies in tackling drug resistance\nis to reposition or repurpose existing drugs which can potentially\nreduce the cost and time of drug development.30 Toward this end, we first investigated the experimental drug chlorpromazine\n(CPZ) (Figure 7a),\na phenothiazine originally developed for treatment of psychosis, and\nits metabolites against the mycobacteria in combination with a number\nof first- and second-line TB drugs and observed a potential for synergy\nwith spectinomycin, kanamycin, STR, and 25-desacetylrifampicin (an\nactive metabolite of rifampicin).31 Another\ndrug we considered for repositioning is the triterpenoid antibiotic,\nfusidic acid (FA), due to its unique MoA, specifically, inhibition\nof bacterial protein synthesis through binding to elongation factor\nG in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\nIt displayed good activity against both DS and DR clinical isolates\nof Mtb(32) and, therefore,\nwas considered a viable candidate for repositioning for TB. We worked\non the SAR of FA with respect to structural modifications that influenced\nin vitro potency, metabolic profile, and pharmacokinetics (Figure 7b).33,34 The rapid biotransformation of FA to its inactive epimer (3-epifusidic\nacid) via 3-keto fusidic acid in rodents complicated proof-of-concept\nstudies in this model.34 A prodrug approach\ninvolving masking the metabolically labile C-3 position through esterification\nwas found to improve absorption and tissue distribution of FA.35 To assess the molecular target of FA, our current\nefforts are focused on deconvoluting its MoA.\nIn recent times, use\nof efflux-pump inhibitors as an option to\naddress drug resistance in TB has emerged. One such efflux-pump inhibitor\nis verapamil (VPL), a calcium channel blocker used clinically for\nthe treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, hypertension,\ncluster headache, and angina. VPL, as such, does not exhibit inhibitory\nactivity against extracellular Mtb but enhances the\nanti-TB activity of other standard drugs, thus making it a potential\ncandidate for treatment shortening and managing drug resistance. To\nthis end, we investigated the SAR around VPL.36,37 Biological evaluation of VPL and norverapamil suggested that these\ncompounds inhibit the expansion of Mtb-specific T\ncells. However, one promising analogue 8 inhibited intracellular Mtb replication without affecting the Mtb-specific T-cell expansion (Figure 7c). This analogue showed efflux-pump inhibition comparable\nto VPL in Mtb, and enhanced the inhibitory activities\nof isoniazid and rifampin on intracellular Mtb.36\nLastly, the most straightforward strategy\nin combating DR-TB is\nto identify novel drug pathway(s)/target(s) that could be exploited\nto effectively kill DR Mtb strains. In this context,\nwe have identified and validated novel drug targets such as, GuaB2,\nencoding an essential inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase involved\nin guanine biosynthesis,38 WecA, an essential\ntransferase of arabinogalactan biosynthesis,39 and Wag31, an essential protein in Mtb which has\nno known enzymatic activity but required for the proper assembly and\nfunction of the elongation machinery during cell division.40\n\n## Conclusion and Future Prospects\nIn the history of antibiotics, not a single drug yet discovered\nis evolution-proof. Sooner or later resistance will develop. Although Mtb exhibits a low mutation rate which is supported by its\nnarrow genetic diversity, lack of a horizontal-gene transfer mechanism,\nand no added environmental benefit, the worsening epidemic of DR Mtb is a serious threat. This underscores the need to act\nnow to stop the spread of these deadly DR strains. The resistance\nexhibited by Mtb to any TB drug is complex due to\nthe contributory role of biological, clinical, and microbiological\nfeatures: prescription vs nonadherence to the treatment, drug combination\nvs drug\u2013drug interaction, granulomatous lesions vs suboptimal\ndrug concentration, and intrinsic resistance vs acquired resistance.\nIn addition to the traditional approach of discovering new drugs,\nother alternative approaches must be used in parallel. A significant\neffort in identifying key bacterial and host pathways and targets/proteins\nmust be invested; this should cover investigations on persisters,\nexploring various networks associated with molecular mechanisms of\npersistence/tolerance. Similarly, a great deal of effort is needed\nin identifying new chemical entities using screening methods that\nclosely mimic the host site environment. This is in view of the sobering\nreality around uncertainties in the biology of TB disease (and to\na certain extent of its pathogen, Mtb), which complicates\nmedicinal chemistry efforts toward optimizing a novel drug/regimen.\nHere, two alternative strategies could be (i) chemical optimization,\nallowing inactivated drugs to escape the resistance mechanisms, and\n(ii) targeting resistance, resistance mechanisms targeted by specific\ninhibitors that can resensitize resistant bacteria to the inactive\ndrugs. We believe that the lack of information related to drug metabolism\nmediated by both host and Mtb enzymes significantly\ncontributes to drug resistance via suboptimal dosing, poor patient\ncompliance, subsequent treatment failure, and relapse. In this context,\npharmacometabonomics, identifying drug-induced metabolome variations,\ncan be useful. Another promising approach to potentially shorten the\ntreatment duration and reduce the residual lung pathology/bacterial\nload is host-directed-therapy (HDT), which we have not covered in\nthis Account. In addition, tailor-made regimens after accurate diagnosis\nshould be practiced, and for this, cross-resistance, synergies, or\nantagonism among drugs of a range of possible combinations must be\nconsidered. Finally, more than ever, understanding the transmission\nof DR strains followed by a possible check is needed; this could be\nachieved by identifying desired genetic markers, supporting timely\ndiagnosis of drug resistance in order to not present Mtb with the opportunity to evolve into a DR monster.",
