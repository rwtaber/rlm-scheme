  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance remains a worldwide health problem with serious societal and economical repercussions. Multidrug resistant and Extended-Spectrum \u03b2-Lactamase producing-Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) are pathogens of critical public health priority that urgently require the research and development of new drugs. This study aims to determine the prevalence and characterize the genes conferring resistance to \u03b2-lactams among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the West region, Cameroon. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among two healthcare facilities during a four-month period from February to May, 2023. All mid-stream urine samples were collected from UTIs patients. The Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae strains were identified using Enterosystem 18R kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The screening of ESBL production was done using ESBL ChromAgar medium combined with the double-disk synergy test (DDT). Antimicrobial resistance genes were detected using polymerase chain methods. The data analysis was performed using Excel 2016 and IBM SPSS version 20. RESULTS: A total of 215 urine samples were collected and analyzed during the study period. A 31.62% (68/215) prevalence of Enterobacterales was detected with prevalence of 79.41% (54/68) and 14.70% (10/68) for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. The overall prevalence of ESBL-Enterobacterales was 64.70% (44/68). About 82% (36/44) of isolates were MDR and high resistance level was observed for amoxicillin\u2009+\u2009clavulanic acid and ceftazidime. The resistance genes detected were blaCTX-M,\u00a0and blaTEM respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study highlight the high burden of MDR and ESBL-E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates from UTIs. The study emphasizes the necessity of routine screening and monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare facilities and community settings. It is therefore crucial to implement antimicrobial stewardship programs in the country and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in hospital settings.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nHospital and community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are amongst the most common infections caused by Enterobacterales affecting especially pediatric patients and women worldwide [1, 2]. High frequency of Enterobacteriaceae involved in urinary tract infections have been reported in several Africa countries with 89.17% in Nigeria, 39.13% in Uganda, 10.1% in Ghana and 21.2% among children in Gambia [3]. These reports shown that most species belonged to Enterobacterales including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis were associated with numerous risk factors such as age, poor economic status, poor hygiene measure, hospitalization, catheterization, sexual activities, pregnancy and diabetes mellitus [3\u20135].\nEmergence and escalation of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae is aggravating the global concern of urinary tract infections. They are commonly associated with increased length of hospital stay, use of last-resort and often expensive drug and increase mortality [6]. Numerous studies reported high prevalence of UTI caused by ESBL-E. coli and K pneumoniae [2, 7\u20139].\nExtended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing penicillin, broad-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams leading to use carbapenems and quinolone as a last resort treatment option [10]. Its emergence is generally derived from blaCTX\u2212M, blaSHV and blaTEM expression [10]. It is well known that blaCTX\u2212M among Enterobacterales disseminate worldwide including in sub-Saharan Africa [6, 10]. However, there is still a paucity of data regarding the prevalence of \u03b2-lactams encoding genes among E. coli and K. pneumoniae in UTI patients in Cameroon and particularly in the Western region. This study aims at determining the prevalence, phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from urine of hospitalized and community patients at Bafoussam Regional Hospital and Dschang Regional Annex Hospital in West region, Cameroon.\n\n## Study settings and design\nThis cross-sectional analysis study was conducted over a four-month period from February to May 2023 in two biggest public hospitals in the Western region of Cameroon. All urine samples from patients presenting signs and symptoms of hospital-acquired infections (HA-UTI) and/or community-acquired infection (CA-UTI) were collected at the medical laboratory of the Dschang Regional Annex Hospital and Bafoussam Regional Hospital. Demographic data were recorded using a case report form and questionnaire.\n\n## Culture and identification\nClean catch mid-stream urines were cultured on Cysteine Lactose Electrolytes Deficient (CLED) agar using a calibrated loop 0.001\u00a0ml, and incubated in presence of oxygen at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. All growing colonies were counted and leukocytes were enumerated with a Malassez cell. UTI was defined based on pyuria (\u2265\u2009104 leukocyte/mL of urine) and positive culture (\u2265\u2009105 colony-forming units) diffusion method.\u00a0Only bacteria that grew at a significant rate (Kass criteria) were identified by their morphological and biochemical characters using Enterosystem 18R according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and ESBL screening methods\nAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) was performed using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method on muller Hinton agar according to the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM) guidelines. A panel of 12 antibiotics belonging to six different families were tested including: amoxicillin\u2009+\u2009clavulanic acid (AMC; 10\u00a0\u03bcg), cefoxitin (CFX; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), ceftazidime (CAZ; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), ceftriaxone (CRO; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), cefotaxime (CTX; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), imipenem (IMP; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), aztreonam (AZT; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), gentamicin (CN; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), amikacin (AN; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), ciprofloxacin (CIP; 5\u00a0\u03bcg), fosfomycin (FOS; 30\u00a0\u03bcg), nitrofurantoin (NIT; 30\u00a0\u03bcg). The production of ESBL was detected through culture on medium namely CHROMagar\u2122 ESBL (CHROMagar, Paris - France). The samples were then stored at -20\u00a0\u00b0C in cryotubes containing trypticase soya broth supplemented with 20% glycerol for future use. Escherichia coli ATCC25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC700603 were used to assess the quality of the media and antibiotic discs. The inhibition zone diameters were measured and interpreted according to the criteria defined by CA-SFM 2022. A participant was considered positive to ESBL-E when at least one ESBL colony was detected. The isolates being resistant to at least one antibiotic of three or more families of antibiotics tested were considered as multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR).\n\n## Conventional and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nGenomic DNA was extracted from all ESBL-E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates by boiling method as previously described [11]. Detection of blaCTX\u2212M,blaTEM and blaOXA\u221248 genes was carried out by multiplex-PCR method using a BIO-RAD thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mames-la coquette, France). The reaction was carried out in a 10 \u03bcL reaction mixture consisting of 5 \u03bcL of Dream Taq green Polymerase Master Mix 2x (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA); 2.6 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water, 0.1 \u03bcL of each forward and reverse primers (10 \u03bcM) and 2 \u03bcL of DNA. Thermal cycler program included initial denaturation (95\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min), 30 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 4s, annealing at 46.9\u00a0\u00b0C for 40s, elongation at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 50s and final elongation at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. In addition, amplification of blaSHV gene occurs in a 10 \u03bcL reaction mixture consisting of 5 \u03bcL Dream Taq Green Polymerase Master Mix 2x (ThermoFisher Scientic, Vilnius, Lithuania), 2.8 \u03bcL nuclease-free water, 0.1 \u03bcL each primer direct and reverse [10 \u03bcM] and 2\u00a0\u03bcl of DNA with approximately the same condition.\n\n## Agarose electrophoresis and gel visualization\nPCR products were subjected to electrophoresis analysis performed on an agarose gel of 1.5% (w/v) that was run at 90\u00a0V for 45\u00a0min along with a 100\u00a0bp molecular ladder (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained in an ethidium bromide solution (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) for 15\u00a0min and briefly unstained with water. PCR products were then visualized under UV light using a gel documentation system G-BOX Chemi-XL (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). An internal quality control for bla genes was assessed using a K. pneumoniae ATCC700603 and internal strains previously sequenced (Unpublished result).\n\n## Statistical analysis\nData analysis was performed using Excel 2016 and IBM SPSS Statistics 20. Proportions were compared using the Fischer exact test and chi-square test as appropriate. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Demographic characteristics\nA total of 215 urine samples were collected from Dschang Regional Annex Hospital (n\u2009=\u2009107) and Bafoussam Regional Hospital laboratories (n\u2009=\u2009108), with 68 (31.62%) of these being positives with at least one Enterobacterales (Fig.\u00a01). Women were more represented than men (65.11%, 140/215 vs. 34.88%, 75/215). The age of participants varies between 1 year and 49 years with a median age of 25 years. Patients aged between 20 and 29 years constitute the most common age group (30.7%) of the population infected by Enterobacterales.\nFig. 1Flowchart of participant isolates.

In addition, ESBL-K. pneumoniae have shown a high-level resistance to amoxicillin clavulanic acid (5/7; 71.42%), aztreonam (5/7; 71.42%) and gentamicin (5/7; 71.42%) (Fig.\u00a02). However, ESBL-E. coli and ESBL-K. pneumoniae displayed high susceptibility for both imipenem and amikacin.\nFig. 2Resistance proportions of ESBL-E. coli and K. pneumoniae.

The most prevalent phenotypic profile was AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-F-ATM-AK-FOS-CIP-CN (3/42; 7,14%) including 10 antibiotics from 5 different family (Table\u00a02).\nTable 2Resistant patterns of ESBL-E. coli and K. pneumoniaePhenotypic profilesNumber of antibioticsNumber of antibiotic familiesFrequency of isolates (%)AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ412(5.55)AMC-ATM-FOS32(5.55)AMC-CN231(2.77)AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-FOS51(2.77)AMC-CRO-CTX-FOX-AK-FOS-CN-IPM82(5.55)AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-F-ATM-CIP72(5.55)AMC-CRO-AK-FOS431(2.77)AMC-CRO-CAZ-FOX-F-AK-CN71(2.77)AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-FOX-F-AK71(2.77)AMC-CRO-CAZ-F-FOS-CIP61(2.77)AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-FOS-CIP-CN72(5.55)AMC-CRO-FOX-F-FOS-CN62(5.55)AMC-CRO-CTX-FOX-F-FOS-CIP-PM81(2.77)AMC-CRO-CAZ-FOX-F-ATM-AK-FOS82(5.55)AMC-CRO-CAZ-ATM-AK-FOS-CIP-CN842(5.55)AMC-CAZ-F-AK-FOS-CN61(2.77)AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-ATM-FOS-CIP-CN81(2.77)AMC-CRO-ATM-AK-FOS-CIP61(2.77)AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-F-ATM-AK-FOS-IPM92(5.55)AMC-CRO-ATM-AK-FOS-CIP-CN71(2.77)\nAMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-F-ATM-AK-FOS-CIP-CN\n\n10\n\n3(8.33)\nAMC-CRO-CTX-F-AK-FOS-CIP-CN82(5.55)AMC-CRO-CAZ-F-ATM-AK-FOS-CN82(5.55)AMC-F-ATM-AK-FOS-CIP-CN71(2.77)AMC-CAZ-FOX-F-AK-FOS-CIP7\n5\n1(2.77)AMC-CRO-CAZ-FOX-F-FOS-CIP-CN82(5.55)AMC-CRO-CTX-F-ATM-AK-FOS-CIP-CN91(2.77)AMC-CRO-CTX-CAZ-F-ATM-FOS-CIP-CN91(2.77)\n\n## Characterization of resistance determinants\nThe overall prevalence of genes was blaCTX\u2212M (42/44; 95.5%), blaTEM (24/44; 54.5%), blaSHV (2/44; 4.5%) and blaOXA48 (2/44; 4.5%). A high prevalence of blaCTX\u2212M was observed among ESBL-E. coli (34/37; 91.89%) and ESBL-K. pneumoniae (5/7; 71.42%). Also, a high prevalence of blaTEM was observed among ESBL-E. coli compare to ESBL-K. pneumoniae with 48.64% (18/37) and 28.57% (2/7) respectively.\n\n## Discussion\nUrinary tract infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae have been widely reported worldwide and represent a critical public health challenge. The alarming resistance observed in sub-Saharan Africa by Murray et al. (2022) urge the importance of surveillance and monitoring efforts for better prevention and containment measures as well as evidence-based decision [12]. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and characterize phenotypically and genotypically the ESBL-E. coli and ESBL-K. pneumoniae in the West region of Cameroon.\nThe findings showed that E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the major Enterobacterales species involved in urinary tract infections in the West region of Cameroon. The overall prevalence of Enterobacterales species was 31.62%. This result is higher than those obtained in Madagascar (12,9%), Gambia (12.8%) and Ghana (10%) [3, 13, 14]. However, it is lower than those reported in Cameroon (59.6%) by Nzalie et al. (2016), where the authors investigated UTIs among the two biggest hospital settings in Yaound\u00e9 and shown that E. coli (50,9%) and K. pneumoniae (16.4%) were the most important bacteria involved in UTI [15, 16]. This result showed that UTI prevalence\u2019s depend on the geographical location in Africa. The result is also lower than that reported in Tanzania (41%) in 2022 [15].\nOur findings revealed that E. coli and K. pneumoniae were the most common Enterobacterales species implicated in UTI which affected predominantly women. This could be explained by the anatomy of urinary tract of women which is generally ascending and colonize by Enterobacterales especially E. coli coming from intestinal tract origin. This is in agreement with numerous studies conducted in Africa where the proportion of E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated in Tanzania, Nigeria and Republic of Djibouti were 40% and 28%, 31.7% and 17.5%, and 82.39% and 9.86% respectively among hospital-and community-acquired urinary tract infections [17].\nThe high prevalence of ESBL-E. coli in our study is alarming but similar to those obtained in India in 2023 (82.5%) [6]. However, this finding is higher than the results obtained in Iraq, Iran, Republic of Djibouti, Algerie, Tunisie, Northern Ethiopia and Morocco where the prevalences were 71.7%, 52%, 41%, 37.1%, 30.8%, 27.8% and 12.2% respectively [1, 18\u201320]. In addition, the prevalence of ESBL-K. pneumoniae is lower than those reported in India (74.3%) and Ethiopia (33.8%) [20] but higher than that obtained in the Republic of Djibouti (7%) [17, 18]. The results observed among ESBL-E. coli could be explained by the fact that these countries have implemented the antimicrobial stewardship program.\nIn this study, ESBL-E. coli were more resistant to amoxicillin\u2009+\u2009clavulanic acid (81.1%), ceftazidime (67.56%), gentamicin (62,16%), fosfomycin (62.16%) and aztreonam (59.45%). In addition, ESBL-Kp were more resistant to amoxicillin\u2009+\u2009clavulanic acid (71.42%), aztreonam (71.42%), gentamicin (71.42%), ceftazidime (57.14%) and fosfomycin (57.14%). A moderate susceptibility to quinolone and \u03b2-lactams families have been observed, despite the broadly prescriptions of theses antibiotics commonly recommended by the physicians to treat UTIs caused by ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Kp in our context, as described [3, 15, 21]. Despite the high resistance levels observed, these isolates were relatively susceptible to nitrofurantoin, imipenem and amikacin. These findings are consistent with a report revealed that ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Kp are more susceptible to nitrofurantoin, imipenem and amikacin [15]. Our findings corroborate with a Cameroonian study carried out in Garoua and where ESBL-Enterobacterales isolates in UTIs were susceptible to amikacin and imipenem [19]. This finding could be explained by the fact that imipenem is not routinely used in the treatment of UTIs in our context, suggesting that it could be the best alternative therapeutic option. This could further be explained by the non-existence of antimicrobial stewardship program in the country, self-medication and over-the-counter supply of antibiotics, over-reliance on antibiotics from physicians, sub-optimal diagnostic and antimicrobial susceptibility testing prior prescription that all contribute to the selective pressure on the microbiome and increasing antimicrobial resistance [22]. The lack of infection prevention and control measures and programs contribute to the fluidity of resistant bacteria between patients in hospitals and communities. The overall prevalence of MDR-E coli and MDR-K pneumoniae was observed which agreed with the results already reported [23]. This high level of MDR-E coli and MDR-K pneumoniae reported could be explained by the excessive and inappropriate use of antibiotics in West region in Cameroon, where antibiotics are easily accessible over the counter without a prescription.\nAmong the different ESBLs genes tested, blaCTX\u2212M and blaTEM genes were the most frequently detected. This is an agreement with previous studies which showed that blaCTX\u2212M was the most common ESBLs gene carried among Enterobacterales responsible for UTIs [17]. These findings disagree with the results of Zemtsa et al. (2022) where the high prevalence of blaTEM and blaCTX\u2212M among HIV patients in Yaound\u00e9 in 2022 was 72% and 48%, respectively [24]. This result can be explained by the fact that in our context, the prescription of third generation cephalosporins is commonly observed over the counter, and this behavior led to increase the resistance to \u03b2-lactams and consequently increase the widespread of blaCTX\u2212M encoding for its resistance.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis study shows the high prevalence of MDR-E. coli and K. pneumoniae implicated in urinary tract infections, intimating the need for rational use of antibiotics to treat UTIs. It revealed that imipenem and amikacin remain antibiotics with good activities against ESBL-E. coli and K. pneumoniae. This study highlights the routine screening of ESBL-E. coli and K. pneumoniae and antimicrobial stewardship program implementation across the country. It emphasizes the urgent need for a national action plan at the regional and local levels to fight against AMR.\n\n## Electronic supplementary material\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.\nSupplementary Material 1",
