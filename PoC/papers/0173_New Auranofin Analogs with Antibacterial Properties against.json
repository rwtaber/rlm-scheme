However, antibiotic resistance is now a global crisis, responsible for approximately 700,000 deaths annually [2], with that number projecting to increase each year [3]. The \u201cgolden era\u201d of antibiotic discovery, which lasted approximately 20 years, led to the identification of vancomycin, methicillin, cephalosporins, and many other antibiotics [1,2]. No new antibiotic from a new class has reached the clinic for many decades [4]. When a new antibiotic is developed that does not have a novel mechanism of action, resistance mechanisms are already present. Therefore, antimicrobials with novel mechanisms of action are needed to prevent this quickly generated resistance.\nBacteria of the genus Burkholderia [5] includes difficult-to-treat human pathogens such as the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei [6]. Bcc is a group of more than 20 species that cause life-threatening bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients [7]. Burkholderia cenocepacia infections, in particular, have one of the worst clinical outcomes [5,8], causing decreased lung function and cepacia syndrome, a sepsis with necrotizing pneumonia [8,9]. Additionally, CF patients infected with B. cenocepacia are often ineligible for lung transplants [10], a common life-saving procedure [8], because B. cenocepacia infections have a high risk of reoccurrence [11].\nNew antibiotics are urgently needed to combat Burkholderia infections. Promising emerging therapeutics are those with heavy metals [12], especially gold [13,14,15,16,17], which have been used in medicine since 2500 B.C.E. Recently, the gold-containing, anti-arthritis drug auranofin [18,19] was found to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Gram-positive bacteria [20]. Auranofin inhibited the function of the enzyme thioredoxin reductase, interrupting thiol-redox homeostasis [20,21]. However, auranofin lacked significant activity against Gram-negative bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) > 16 mg/L [20].\nWe previously found that auranofin is active against Helicobacter pylori and synthesized sugar-modified analogs have improved antibiotic activity and reduced toxicity to mammalian cells [21]. By varying the structures of the thiol and phosphine ligands on auranofin, we expanded the antibacterial activity of the auranofin analogs to the Gram-negative pathogens including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli [22]. In this work, we describe the characterization of two auranofin analogs, WB-19-HL4170 (MS-40S) and WB-19-HL4118 (MS-40), which show potential as antimicrobials against Bcc strains, B. pseudomallei and B. mallei. MS-40S and MS-40 are bactericidal against B. cenocepacia, kill persister cells, and do not select for multistep resistant mutations while maintaining low toxicity to eukaryotic systems.\n\n## 2.1. MIC of Auranofin Derivatives against a Panel of Burkholderia Cepacia Complex Species\nWe tested auranofin and ten auranofin analogs (Figure 1) against a panel of Bcc bacteria, comprising of clinical isolates from CF patients and strains from environmental sources. Auranofin (Figure 1, top left) and the analogues belonging to group one (Figure 1, top right) were largely inactive against members of the Bcc (Table S1), with most of the MICs being 128 \u03bcg/mL or higher. Group one analogs have modifications of the thioglucose ligands, with or without additional replacing of trimethylphosphine (-PMe3) to triethylphosphine (-PEt3) coordinated bonding to the gold atom. Auranofin, however, showed high activity against B. mallei with MICs ranging from 0.25\u20131 \u03bcg/mL. In B. pseudomallei, auranofin had an MIC of 64 \u03bcg/mL. Auranofin and the group one derivatives in this study were shown to have diverse activity in other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, but they were inactive or had low activity in P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. pneumoniae [22].\nGroup two (Figure 1, bottom) includes the analog WB-19-HL4118 (MS-40) which had shown a low MIC in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, such as in A. baumannii, E. cloacae, E. coli, and S. aureus [22]. Therefore, we synthetized additional analogs with similar structures to MS-40. Group two analogs showed lower MICs against members of the Bcc (Table 1) than group one (Table S1). Remarkably, MS-40 and WB-19-HL4170 (MS-40S) showed the strongest activity (Table 1). These two compounds also have high activity in B. mallei and B. pseudomallei strains as well. The synthesis of MS-40S and MS-40 is shown in Scheme 1. The remaining derivatives from this group have moderate MICs, ranging from 8 to 64 \u03bcg/mL, with only a few being 128 \u03bcg/mL or higher. The structures of the group two derivatives have substitution of thioglucose ligands with mercaptoethanol (HOCH2CH2SH) or mercaptoethanol modification, suggesting that the thioglucose was unable to permeate into most of the Bcc bacterial cell.\nNext, we compared the MICs of MS-40S and MS-40 to common antibiotics used to treat CF patients infected with Burkholderia spp. Those include ceftazidime [23,24], meropenem [23,24,25,26], doxycycline [27], and tobramycin [24,25,26]. The combination therapy ceftazidime\u2013avibactam is considered the last resort treatment for those infected with Burkholderia species [9]; therefore, we determined the MIC of ceftazidime\u2013avibactam and these four antibiotics against the Bcc panel (Table 2). The MICs of MS-40 and MS-40S are much lower than the antibiotic tobramycin and are similar to the other antibiotics, including the last resort combination treatment ceftazidime\u2013avibactam. Additionally, doxycycline, against some isolates from the Bcc, had MIC values as low as 1 and 2 \u03bcg/mL. Taken together, the initial MIC testing shows MS-40S and MS-40 are comparable to antibiotics used currently in the clinic, having MICs lower than most and even have similar values to the combination therapy ceftazidime\u2013avibactam.\n\n## 2.2. MS-40S Has Broad Bactericidal Activity\nIndividuals with CF are commonly infected by multiple bacteria, causing polymicrobial infections [28,29]. Therefore, for MS-40S and MS-40 to be effective antimicrobials, it is imperative for these compounds to kill additional CF pathogens. Common bacteria that cause CF lung infections, besides Burkholderia spp., are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Achromobacter xylosoxidans [28,30]. Other pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria that were shown to, although rarely, cause CF pulmonary infections include Escherichia coli [31], Escherichia vulneris [32], Klebsiella pneumoniae [30], and Acinetobacter species [32].\nWe thus tested MS-40S against CF pathogens to determine their MIC and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration), and the same was done with MS-40 (Table 3). MS-40S have low MICs for the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus, one of which is an MRSA strain. MS-40S is also bactericidal against the other Gram-negative bacteria tested with MICs in the range of 1\u201316 \u03bcg/mL and most of the MBCs were between 1- and 4-fold of their respective MICs. P. aeruginosa is a common multi-drug resistant bacterium [33], with some strains/clinical isolates being extensively-drug resistant [34], and has moderate MIC values between 16 and 64 \u03bcg/mL and its MBCs between 2- and 16-fold higher than its MICs. MS-40 shows similar results to MS-40S. Overall, the MICs/MBCs against CF pathogens show MS-40S and MS-40 have broad-spectrum bactericidal activity, indicating their potential as a therapeutic option for CF patients.\n\n## 2.3. MS-40S Does Not Select for Multistep Resistant Mutants\nNew antimicrobials are urgently needed because resistance to current antibiotics has arisen and spread to many bacteria [3,35,36]. Ideally, resistance will occur slowly for new antimicrobials, or not at all. We therefore characterized the occurrence of resistance to MS-40S due to repeated exposure and continuous growth [37]. Bacteria grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of each compound (0.5\u00d7 MIC) were subcultured and grown overnight in Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) broth. These cultures were then used for the next MIC test, and this process was repeated for a total of 24 days (Figure 2, left). We performed this procedure for MS-40S, MS-40 and the antibiotics meropenem and doxycycline. These antibiotics were chosen because they are commonly used to treat cystic fibrosis patients infected with Burkholderia species [23,24,25,26,27], and they have different mechanisms of action and resistance [3,38].\nFigure 2 (right) shows that resistance against meropenem and doxycycline arose quickly. While their starting MICs values were 16 and 4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, both MICs reached 256 \u03bcg/mL after 12\u201316 days. Remarkably, no apparent increase in their MICs was observed for MS-40S and MS-40, demonstrating a desired property as a potential therapeutic agent.\n\n## 2.4. MS-40S Is Bactericidal against Both Replicating and Non-Replicating Cells\nAntibiotics are classified either as bactericidal, if they kill cells and reduce the population by 99.99%, or bacteriostatic, if they prevent cell growth/division, but do not kill more than 99.99% of the population [38,39]. It is common for antibiotics to only target actively dividing cells because their targets are involved in replication or other energy-dependent processes [38], rendering them less effective when cells are not replicating or respiring [40]. In time kill experiments, we found MS-40S to be bactericidal to both exponential (replicating) and stationary (non-replicating) phase cells, and the same was found for MS-40 (Figure 3; top 4 panels). Interestingly, MS-40S is more effective at killing stationary phase (Figure 3; middle right) than exponential phase cells (Figure 3; middle left), reducing the culture by approximately three log10 units and nine log10 units at 4\u00d7 MIC in the exponential and stationary phase, respectively. For comparison purposes, we show that doxycycline and ceftazidime\u2013avibactam are both unable to kill cells in stationary phase (Figure 3; bottom right) and ceftazidime\u2013avibactam is slow at killing exponential phase cells, regardless of the concentration (Figure 3; bottom left).\nThe finding that MS-40S and MS-40 are able to kill stationary phase cells highlights their potential as future therapeutics. Stationary phase cells contain a higher amount of persister cells that could be a common cause of relapses in infections [10,41].\n\n## 2.5. MS-40S Kill and Inhibit the Formation of Persister Cells\nPersister cells, a subpopulation that is not killed by an antimicrobial, are thought to be a common cause of relapses in infections and persistent infections [41,42]. Persisters are thought to form via randomly overexpressing a resistance factor, decreased growth rate, decreased cellular energy, and/or a slower lag phase [42,43]. Once the antibiotic is removed, they will begin to grow normally, without inherited resistance, termed \u201cpersister awakening\u201d [43]. A stationary phase population has increased amounts of persisters because it is slower growing and is metabolically dormant [41]. MS-40S and MS-40 can kill stationary phase cells effectively, so we reasoned that the compounds might kill persister cells.\nWe exposed an exponentially growing B. cenocepacia K56-2 population to 5\u00d7 MIC of ciprofloxacin (MIC, 2 \u03bcg/mL) for 3 h, to enrich the surviving population in persister cells. After the treatment, surviving cells were washed and collected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to prevent persister awakening [44], then exposed to the MS-40S and MS-40. Figure 4 show persister cells, in the presence of MS-40S and MS-40 (Figure 4, top panels), are killed to a concentration below/close to the limit of detection, whereas the persister cells re-exposed to ciprofloxacin or those without antibiotics are not killed. This demonstrates that MS-40S and MS-40 can indeed kill persister cells created by other antibiotics.\nTo determine the amount of persisters remaining after 24 h of exposure, we performed the persister frequency assay [45]. We exposed a culture with a CFU/mL of 1 \u00d7 108, to one of the antimicrobials for 24 h. Compounds tested included MS-40S, meropenem, ceftazidime\u2013avibactam, and MS-40. The remaining cells, enriched in persisters, were plated on LB to determine CFU/mL and percent survival was calculated by the log10 CFU/mL values. After 24 h, no persisters were formed after exposure to 10\u00d7 MIC MS-40S, and a very low persister frequency with 5\u00d7 MIC MS-40S (Figure 4, bottom). No persisters were formed exposed to 5\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 MIC of MS-40 and meropenem also produced a low amount of persisters at both concentrations tested. The last resort combination therapy ceftazidime\u2013avibactam (CZA) produced the most persisters in this assay, with approximately 30% of the culture enriched in persisters surviving after treatment.\nTaken together, these results show MS-40S, as well as MS-40, can kill persister cells created by other antibiotics and can inhibit persister cell formation. This suggests that MS-40S, as well as MS-40, have the potential to effectively eradicate an infection, reducing the risk of a relapse in infection after the treatment regime.\n\n## 2.6. C. elegans and G. mellonella Toxicity\nIn preliminary cytotoxicity tests, MS-40 was shown to have lower toxicity in human A549 cells than auranofin [21,22]; however, the novel MS-40S has not been tested. To show that these compounds are safe for eukaryotic cells, we first used C. elegans as a model organism.\nWe performed a survival assay with Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to MS-40S, and three clinical antibiotics: the combination ceftazidime\u2013avibactam, meropenem, and doxycycline, as well as MS-40 (Table 4). We calculated the Survival100/MIC value, which is a ratio of the highest concentration with 100% survival to the compound\u2019s MIC [46]. This is a preliminary view to a compound\u2019s therapeutic index. MS-40S has similar Survival100/MIC values as clinical antibiotics, with MS-40S, doxycycline, and ceftazidime\u2013avibactam having values of 8, 16, and 32, respectively, and MS-40 and meropenem having a value of four. Similar to C. elegans, Galleria larvae were also well tolerated to MS-40S (Table 5). This was compared to MS-40 and a clinical antibiotic, doxycycline, which has similar MIC values to MS-40S and MS-40. Concentrations used ranged from 10 to 1 mg/kg. MS-40S and MS-40 were safe for the larvae at concentrations of 10 mg/kg with a percent survival of approximately 80% and higher. This was similar as the clinical antibiotic, doxycycline. Taken together, C. elegans and Galleria toxicity models show that MS-40S, as well as MS-40, have low toxicity in these eukaryotic organisms.\n\n## 3. Discussion\nHere, we show initial antibiotic properties of two auranofin analogs, MS-40 and the novel compound MS-40S, against the cystic fibrosis pathogen B. cenocepacia K56-2. The antibiotic properties were explored in parallel with commonly used antibiotics, namely doxycycline, meropenem, and ceftazidime\u2013avibactam. This comparison shows MS-40S and MS-40 to have potential to be developed as antibiotics. One difference between MS-40S and MS-40 and the antibiotics used in this study is the ability of MS-40S and MS-40 to eliminate non-replicating cells. It is common for antibiotics to act on essential targets, such as those involved in cell wall synthesis, DNA replication, and translation [38]. In stationary phase, most of these processes are decreased, preventing the antibiotics from acting upon the cell. We confirmed this with two antibiotics with different mechanisms of action (MOA): doxycycline, a tetracycline that binds to the 30 s subunit of the ribosome, preventing translation elongation [47], and ceftazidime\u2013avibactam, a cephalosporin\u2013\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combination that inhibits cell wall synthesis [48]. These two antibiotics did not kill cells in stationary phase. Our data show that MS-40S and MS-40 are bactericidal against both replicating and non-replicating cells. Interestingly, MS-40S was shown to kill a greater amount of stationary phase cells than exponential phase, unlike MS-40. This suggests that the MOA of these two compounds may be slightly different.\nB. cenocepacia strains are inherently resistant to many available antibiotics [6,10,49], leaving only a few available for treatment. As shown in the resistance studies, resistance is not easy to achieve for MS-40S and MS-40. Mutational resistance can be achieved by altering the antibiotic gene targets, decreasing the binding affinity of the antimicrobial to the gene product, decreasing the uptake/increase in efflux, or, lastly, by changing global responses such as changing a metabolic pathway [3]. Meropenem and doxycycline quickly generated multistep resistance, possibly by one of the mechanisms listed above; however, resistance did not emerge for MS-40S and MS-40. This might be due to MS-40S and MS-40 not being affected by the change of porins/efflux pumps that can cause resistance to other antimicrobials [3], especially in Burkholderia species [6,10,50]. Alternately, mutations in the gene targets of MS-40S and MS-40 could have resulted in a reduced fitness of the resistant mutant cell, preventing the mutant from outcompeting the sensitive cells [51,52].\nAdditionally, MS-40S and MS-40 can clear difficult-to-eradicate persister cells which commonly cause relapses in infections [42]. This suggests these compounds could eradicate the difficult-to-treat persistent infections in the CF lung, helping CF patients infected with Burkholderia species become eligible for lung transplants by [11]. MS-40S and MS-40 were shown to eliminate persister cells in two ways. The first way was by killing an enriched population of ciprofloxacin-generated persisters, reducing the population by a further 1\u20132 log10 CFU/mL. The second way was from a stationary-phase population of bacteria exposed solely to MS-40S and MS-40, with MS-40S only having a small amount of persisters at 5\u00d7 MIC and MS-40 producing no persisters. Alternatively, the persister frequency was low for meropenem (5\u20137%), and approximately 30% for ceftazidime\u2013avibactam, similar to the amount produced by Burkholderia pseudomallei exposed to ceftazidime [45]. Therefore, MS-40S and MS-40 could be used on their own to eliminate infections, or in tandem with current antibiotics to help eradicate infections [53].\nWe have also showed MS-40S and MS-40 have low toxicity in C. elegans and G. mellonella. One limitation of these compounds is that we did not observe in vivo antibiotic activity in C. elegans and G. mellonella infected with B. cenocepacia K56-2 (data not shown). To help explain why we were not seeing a protective effect, we tested the MIC of MS-40S and MS-40 in 50% human serum. In the presence of 50% human serum, the MICs of both compounds increased to 128 \u03bcg/mL, suggesting these compounds bind non-specifically to proteins, which could decrease their antimicrobial activity. To increase the efficacy of these potent antimicrobials, a drug delivery system must be developed. One possible route is the creation of an MS-40S/MS-40-loaded liposome, as has been shown with rifampicin in the treatment of pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus infections [54]. Creating an aerosolized antimicrobial therapy would also allow us to achieve higher concentrations of the drug, and increase lung penetration, which is especially important for CF pulmonary infections [55].\nAuranofin, and previously published auranofin analogues, inhibits thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme that plays a role in thiol-homeostasis in the cell [20,21]. However, it is unclear whether MS-40S and MS-40 share the same target with auranofin. It is assumed that the active component of auranofin is the gold atom, which binds the sulfur in the active site of thioredoxin reductase, inhibiting the formation of the critical disulfide bond, disrupting the function of the enzyme [18,21]. Auranofin was shown to have other effects on the bacterial cell, such as inhibiting DNA, protein, and cell wall synthesis. Thus, thioredoxin reductase may not be the sole antimicrobial target [17]. It is assumed that MS-40 and MS-40S will have similar effects inside the cell as auranofin, possibly having a multi-target mechanism of action. The lack of multi-step resistance may support this multi-target mechanism of action because multiple mutations would be needed to generate resistance. The other potential targets of auranofin and auranofin derivatives are not known. Other factors in the mechanism of action of the antimicrobials, which can explain differences in activity among compounds with slightly different structures, can be associated efflux pumps and transporters. Future research avenues could include determining the mechanism of action of MS-40S and MS-40, including the targets of the compounds, permeability factors, such as transporters and efflux pumps, and how these compounds kill persister cells and stationary phase cells.\n\n## 4.1. Materials\nAll reagents and solvents were used as received from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific unless noted. Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using TLC plates pre-coated with silica gel 60 F254 (SiliCycle, Qu\u00e9bec, QC, Canada), visualized with a handheld ultraviolet device either directly or after staining with 5% H2SO4 in ethanol. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance Spectrospin DRX500 spectrometer, referenced either to the non-deuterated residual solvent peaks or tetramethyl silane peak (TMS, \u03b4 0.00 ppm). 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance Spectrospin DPX200 spectrometer, using freshly prepared triphenylphosphine solution (0.1 M in CDCl3, \u03b4 \u22126.00 ppm) as the external standard.\n\n## 4.2.

The solution was stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 23 h. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated and was then transferred to a 20-mL scintillation vial with a total volume of ~5 mL. The solution was placed in an ether vapor environment at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The yellow crystals formed were washed by diethyl ether and were further purified by preparative silica gel TLC (10:1 v/v dichloromethane/methanol) to give the product as a white solid (22 mg, 7.5%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD2Cl2) \u03b4 1.60 (t, J = 4.1 Hz, 1H), (Figure S13). 31P NMR (162 MHz, CD2Cl2) \u03b4 8.2, 143.8 (septet, JPF = 710 Hz), (Figure S14).\n\n## 4.4. Auranofin Derivatives and Antibiotic Stock Solutions\nStock solutions were prepared by dissolving the compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Antibiotics were suspended at the following concentrations: tobramycin (Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA), 10 mg/mL in H2O; chloramphenicol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 20 mg/mL in ethanol; ceftazidime (Sigma), 10 mg/mL in 0.1 M NaOH; meropenem (Sigma), 10 mg/mL in DMSO; doxycycline (Sigma), 25 mg/mL in H2O; ciprofloxacin (Sigma), 10 mg/mL in 0.1 M HCl; and avibactam (MedKoo Biosciences, Morrisville, NC, USA), 10 mg/mL in DMSO.\n\n## 4.5. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and Multistep Resistance to Active Derivatives\nThe compounds were diluted from their stock solutions to 256 \u03bcg/mL in Cation-Adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth (CAMHB) for use in the experiment. Determination of the MIC was followed by standards set by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [56]. The 96-well plates were filled with 50 \u03bcL of CAMHB, combined with a concentration gradient of compound to be tested. Bacterial culture was diluted to a turbidity equal to MacFarland Standard 0.5, then diluted 100-fold in CAMHB. A total of 50 \u03bcL of culture was transferred into each well. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C with no shaking for 18 h, MIC was read visually as the lowest concentration of antibiotic that prevented growth.\nTo determine the rate of multistep resistance mutations from serial passaging, the assay was performed as described previously [37,57]. From the MIC plate, 30 \u00b5L from the well that had bacterial growth at the highest concentration of the antimicrobial (0.5\u00d7 MIC) for each of the compounds tested, was inoculated into 2 mL of LB without compound and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C with shaking. These overnight cultures were then used as the culture for a second MIC test, and this was repeated 12 times for a total of 24 days of continuous growth.\n\n## 4.6. Time Kill Assays\nBacterial cultures were grown overnight and either subcultured to an OD600 of 0.025 or left in stationary phase. If subcultured, the bacteria were grown to early exponential phase (OD600 of 0.13\u20130.18). The bacteria were exposed to the antibiotics at 1\u00d7, 2\u00d7, and 4\u00d7 the MIC, as well as no antibiotic for a negative control. Each hour from time zero to six hours, a sample of each condition was serially diluted to a dilution factor of 10\u22128, and 5 \u03bcL of each dilution was spotted onto LB agar. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C to determine CFU/mL.\n\n## 4.7. Time Kill of Persister Cells\nThe generation and collection of persister cells was adapted from Bahar et al. [44]. Briefly, persister cells were generated by subculturing an overnight culture of B. cenocepacia K56-2 in LB and grown until it reached early exponential phase (OD600 of 0.13\u20130.18). The culture was then exposed to 5\u00d7 MIC of ciprofloxacin (CIP; MIC = 2 \u03bcg/mL) with 0\u00d7 MIC as a control for three hours. For the initial time zero count, a sample was taken and diluted to a factor of 10\u22128 and 5 \u03bcL was spotted onto LB. After the initial count, ciprofloxacin was added to the corresponding culture. A sample was taken every hour for three hours for CFU/mL counts, as mentioned above. After the third hour, the remaining population, enriched in persister cells, was collected, washed, and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), divided into five tubes, and again exposed to 5\u00d7 MIC ciprofloxacin or different concentrations of MS-40S or MS-40 (2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 the MIC), along with a no antibiotic condition as a control. Samples were taken every hour for an additional three hours. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h and counted for CFU/mL.\n\n## 4.8. Persister Frequency Assay\nThe persister frequency assay was performed as described in Ross et al. [45]. An overnight culture of B. cenocepacia K56-2 was subcultured to a concentration of 1 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL in 2 mL LB. Antimicrobials tested, meropenem, ceftazidime\u2013avibactam, MS-40S, and MS-40 were added to a final concentration of 5\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 MIC. The cultures were exposed to the antibiotics for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with shaking. After 24 h the culture was plated on LB to determine CFU/mL. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h.\n\n## 4.9.
