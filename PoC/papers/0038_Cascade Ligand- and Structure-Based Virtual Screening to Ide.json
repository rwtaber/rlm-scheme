  "abstract": "Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, though migratory movements have recently spread it to other regions. Here, we have applied a cascade virtual screening campaign combining ligand- and structure-based methods. In order to find novel inhibitors of putrescine uptake in Trypanosoma cruzi, an ensemble of linear ligand-based classifiers obtained by has been applied as initial screening filter, followed by docking into a homology model of the putrescine permease TcPAT12. 1,000 individual linear classifiers were inferred from a balanced dataset. Subsequently, different schemes were tested to combine the individual classifiers: MIN operator, average ranking, average score, average voting, with MIN operator leading to the best performance. The homology model was based on the arginine/agmatine antiporter (AdiC) from Escherichia coli as template. It showed 64% coverage of the entire query sequence and it was selected based on the normalized Discrete Optimized Protein Energy parameter and the GA341 score. The modeled structure had 96% in the allowed area of Ramachandran's plot, and none of the residues located in non-allowed regions were involved in the active site of the transporter. Positivity Predictive Value surfaces were applied to optimize the score thresholds to be used in the ligand-based virtual screening step: for that purpose Positivity Predictive Value was charted as a function of putative yields of active in the range 0.001-0.010 and the Se/Sp ratio. With a focus on drug repositioning opportunities, DrugBank and Sweetlead databases were subjected to screening. Among 8 hits, cinnarizine, a drug frequently prescribed for motion sickness and balance disorder, was tested against T. cruzi epimastigotes and amastigotes, confirming its trypanocidal effects and its inhibitory effects on putrescine uptake. Furthermore, clofazimine, an antibiotic with already proven trypanocidal effects, also displayed inhibitory effects on putrescine uptake. Two other hits, meclizine and butoconazole, also displayed trypanocidal effects (in the case of meclizine, against both epimastigotes and amastigotes), without inhibiting putrescine uptake.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) describes neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) as a group of tropical diseases which mainly affect people living in poverty, lacking adequate sanitary conditions and in close contact with the infectious vectors (World Health Organization, 2015). One the most important NTDs\u2014in numerical terms\u2014is Chagas disease, a parasitic disease endemic to Latin-America, caused by the infection by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite can be transmitted to humans and more than 150 domestic and wild mammals, making complete eradication of the parasite practically impossible. The main route of transmission of T. cruzi is through the feces of the insect vector, known as vinchuca, a bug of the subfamily Triatominae. There are also other transmission routes, as congenital transmission and blood transfusions (Rassi et al., 2010), which are becoming increasingly important in the last years. WHO estimates based on 2010 data indicate that more than 6 million people are infected with T. cruzi worldwide, mostly in Latin-American countries (World Health Organization, 2015). However, several reports suggest that the actual number of infected people could be quite higher, reaching 10 million people (Ventura-Garcia et al., 2013; Stanaway and Roth, 2015; Browne et al., 2017).\nChagas disease presents two clinical phases. The initial or acute phase, which lasts between 4 and 8 weeks, is in general asymptomatic or might present as a self-limiting febrile illness. After the acute phase, an indeterminate, latent phase follows, with absence of clinical symptoms. About 60\u201370% of these people will remain in the indeterminate phase, but the remaining 30\u201340% will develop the symptomatic chronic phase characterized by damage to specific organs\u2014particularly heart, esophagus, or colon. The chronic phase remains throughout life drastically reducing life expectancy among these patients (Nunes et al., 2013).\nThe only two approved drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease so far are Benznidazole and Nifurtimox, launched in the early 1970s. Both compounds are well-tolerated in children and effective during the acute phase. However, they present considerable side effects in adults, different susceptibility among T. cruzi strains and limited efficacy in adults in chronic phase (Morillo et al., 2015; Bermudez et al., 2016).\nDrug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, indication expansion and indication shift) represents an interesting strategy to approach the development of new medications for NTD (Ekins et al., 2011; Bellera et al., 2015; Ferreira and Andricopulo, 2016; Sbaraglini et al., 2016). It consists in finding novel medical uses for existing drugs, including approved, experimental, discontinued and shelved drugs. Drug repurposing has several advantages over the search of de novo drugs. Since the new indication is built on already available pharmacokinetic and safety data, drug development time and costs can be considerably shortened. Possible manufacturing issues have also been solved. There are several successful cases of repositioned drugs in the field of NTDs: the anticancer drug eflornithine has been approved for the treatment of sleeping sickness and the antifungal drug amphotericin B has been repurposed for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. To date, however, although there are several reports of drug candidates to be repositioned for the treatment of Chagas disease, none of these has yet been approved (Andrews et al., 2014; Klug et al., 2016; Sbaraglini et al., 2016). While initially drug repurposing stories arose from serendipitous observations, the drug discovery community has progressively adopted more systematic approximations to indication expansion (Ekins et al., 2011; Jin and Wong, 2014; Ferreira and Andricopulo, 2016), including genomic and structural biology tools, in silico screening and high-throughput screening platforms.\nPolyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) are low molecular weight polycations with crucial physiologic role in all the eukaryotic cells. They take part in fundamental cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, macromolecular biosynthesis and protection against oxidative damage. The polyamine metabolism in T. cruzi differs significantly from its human counterpart since the parasite lacks the enzymes arginine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase, which are necessary for the biosynthesis of polyamines (Figure 1; Carrillo et al., 1999, 2003). Thus, T. cruzi depends on the incorporation of polyamines from the host cell. These functions are carried out by polyamine transporters such as the high-affinity putrescine permease TcPAT12 (or TcPOT1.1) which does not present homologous in the mammalian lineage (Carrillo et al., 2006). The importance of polyamines for parasites survival, the inability of the parasite to biosynthesize polyamines and the exclusivity of the putrescine transporter in T. cruzi makes putrescine uptake an attractive target for the search of new trypanocidal drugs (Hasne et al., 2016).\nBack in 2016, we reported the first in silico drug repurposing campaign to discover novel inhibitors of polyamine uptake in T. cruzi (Alberca et al., 2016); such study applied an ensemble of ligand-based models to screen DrugBank 4.0 and Sweetlead databases and resulted in the identification of three candidates that impaired putrescine transport: paroxetine, triclabendazole and sertaconazole. Here, we have improved our ligand-based computational models and complemented them with molecular docking based on a homology model of TcPAT12; the combined screening has been applied to identify two new TcPAT12 potential inhibitors: clofazimine and cinnarizine. We also report, for the first time, the use of Positivity Predictive Value (PPV) surfaces analysis to select the score threshold that will be used in the virtual screening procedure. The two hits were assayed against T. cruzi epimastigotes and trypomastigotes, and the inhibitory effect on putrescine uptake was also determined.\n\n## Dataset collection\nPolyamine analogs previously assayed against T. cruzi were compiled from literature. 256 polyamine analogs were found and conformed the dataset used here for model calibration and validation. Such dataset was curated using the standardization tool available in Instant JCHEM v. 17.2.6.0. We have labeled the 256 compounds as ACTIVE or INACTIVE according to their half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) against T. cruzi. The ACTIVE category included compounds with EC50 below 20 \u03bcM; the remaining compounds were included in the INACTIVE category. Considering such cut-off, the dataset includes 116 actives and 140 inactives. The molecular diversity of the whole dataset and within each category can be appreciated in the heatmaps displayed in Figure 2, which show, for every compound pair in the database, the Tanimoto distance computed using ECFP_4 molecular fingerprints. The heatmap was built using Gitools v. 2.3.1 (Perez-Lamas and Lopez-Bigas, 2011) and Tanimoto distances were calculated using ScreenMD\u2014Molecular Descriptor Screening v. 5.5.0.1 (ChemAxon, 2002-2011). The dataset is included as Supplementary Information.\n\n## Dataset splitting\nThe resulting dataset of 256 polyamine analogs was divided into two groups using a representative sampling procedure: (a) training set, that was used to calibrate the models and; (b) test set, that was used to externally validate the models. The representative partition of the dataset resulted from a serial combination of clustering procedures: first, we have used the hierarchical clustering method included in LibraryMCS software (version 17.2.13.0\u2013ChemAxon), which relies on the Maximum Common Substructure (MCS). From the resulting clusters, a compound from each cluster was randomly chosen and used as a seed to perform a non-hierarchical clustering using the k-means algorithm, as implemented in Statistica 10 Cluster Analysis module (Statsoft, 2011). Such procedure was performed in an independent manner for the ACTIVE and INACTIVE categories.\nSeventy-five percent of the compounds in each cluster of the ACTIVE category were kept for the training set (totaling 87 compounds); an equal number of compounds were taken from the INACTIVE category clusters (62.14% of each INACTIVE cluster). The remaining 29 active and 53 inactive compounds were assigned to test set. Note that, to obtain the training set, we have under-sampled the INACTIVE category, so that a balanced calibration sample was obtained. In that way, model bias toward predicting a specific category was avoided.\n\n## Molecular descriptor calculation and modeling procedure\nThree thousand six hundred sixty-eight conformation-independent descriptors were computed with Dragon 6.0 software. A random subspace-based method was applied to obtain 1,000 random descriptor subsets of no more than 200 potential independent variables each. In the random subspace approach, the features (independent variables, e.g., molecular descriptors) are randomly sampled and each model (learner) is trained on one subset of the feature space (El Habib Daho and Amine Chikh, 2015; Vyskovsky et al., 2016), which causes individual models not to over-focus on features that display high explanatory power in the training set.\nA dummy, binary variable (class label) was used as dependent variable. Such variable was assigned observed values of 1 for compounds within the ACTIVE, and observed values of 0 for compounds in the INACTIVE category.\nUsing a Forward Stepwise approach and a semi-correlation approach (Toropova and Toropov, 2017), 1,000 linear classifiers were obtained, one from each of the random subsets of features. In order to avoid overfitting, only one molecular descriptor every 10 training instances was allowed into each model, with no more than 12 independent variables per model. No regression coefficient with p-value above 0.05 was allowed into the model.\nR language and environment was used for all data analysis. The R package data table (https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table) was used to handle datasets.\nThe robustness and predictive ability of the models were estimated through randomization and leave-group-out cross-validation tests. In the case of randomization, the class label was randomized across the compounds in the training set. The training set with the randomized dependent variable was then used to train new models from the descriptor selection step. Such procedure was repeated 10 times within each descriptor subset. It is expected that the randomized models with perform poorly compared to the real ones. Regarding the Leave-Group-Out cross-validation, 18-compound subsets were randomly removed from the training set in each cross-validation round and the model was regenerated. The resulting model was used to predict the class label for the 18 removed compounds. The procedure was repeated 10 times, removing each of the training set compounds once.\n\n## Ensemble learning\nClassifier ensembles are known to handle complex data and to provide better generalization and accuracy than single model classifiers (El Habib Daho and Amine Chikh, 2015; Carbonneau et al., 2016; Min, 2016; Vyskovsky et al., 2016); they can be particularly useful to prevent overfitting when handling datasets that suffer from small sample size while their dimensionality is large (Vyskovsky et al., 2016), a quite frequent scenario in the drug design field.\nThe best individual classifiers were selected and combined (selective ensemble learning approach) using the area under the ROC curve metric (AUC ROC) as criterion of performance. Systematic combinations of the 2\u2013100 best performing classifiers were analyzed. Four combination schemes were applied to obtain a combined score: MIN operator (which returns the minimum score among the individual scores of the combined models); Average Score; Average Ranking and Average Voting. Voting was computed according to the equation previously used by Zhang and Muegge (2006). AUC ROCs were obtained with the pROC package (Robin et al., 2011); the Delong method was used to obtain 95% confidence intervals.\n\n## Pilot (retrospective) screening campaign\nThrough simulated ranking experiments, Truchon et al. demonstrated that the AUC ROC metric is dependent on the ratio of actives/inactives, and the standard deviation of the metric converges to a constant value when small yield of actives of the screened library (Ya, also called ratio of actives or prevalence of activity) are used (ratios of actives below 0.05 seem to provide more robust results). Reasonably small Ya also ensures that the saturation effect is constant or absent. A high number of decoys (around 1,000 or higher) contribute to a controlled statistical behavior, especially if poorly performing classifiers/methods are applied (Truchon and Bayly, 2007). Accordingly, we have performed pilot (retrospective) VS campaigns for the individual classifiers and classifier ensembles. For that purpose, we have dispersed the active compounds from each test set among a large number of decoys obtained with the help of the enhanced Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD-E) (Mysinger et al., 2012). Each of the test set active compounds from each dataset was used as a query in the DUD-E website, thus generating paired putative inactive compounds (decoys) for each of those active compounds. As a result, the pilot database contained 29 known active compounds dispersed among 1302 DUD-E decoys and 53 known inactive compounds, adding up a total of 1384 compounds and displaying a Ya of 0.021.\n\n## Building positivity predictive value surfaces and choosing an adequate score threshold value\nA practical concern in virtual screening campaigns is to predict the actual probability that a predicted hit will prove truly active when submitted to experimental testing (the PPV). Estimation of such probability is however obstructed due to its dependency on the Ya of the screened library, which cannot be known a priori:\nwhere Se represents the sensitivity associated to a given score cutoff value and Sp represents the specificity. Equation (1) was applied to build PPV surfaces. 3D plots illustrating the interplay between PPV, the Se/Sp ratio and Ya were built for each individual model and for each model ensemble. Using the corresponding pilot database (as described in previous subsections), Se and Sp were computed in all the range of possible cutoff score values. Note that there is no guarantee that the Se and Sp associated to each score value (and thus, the ratio Se/Sp) will be the same when applying the classifiers to other compound databases, e.g., in the real virtual screening campaign; nevertheless, since controlled statistical behavior is observed for database sizes of about 1000 compounds or more and Ya below 0.05, we can reasonably assume that the ROC curve and derived metrics will be similar when applying the models to classify other large chemical databases with low Ya. In order to build the PPV surfaces, and taking into consideration that in real VS applications Ya is ignored a priori but invariably low, Ya was varied between 0.001 and 0.010. The R package plotly (https://cran.r-project.org/package=plotly) was used to obtain all the PPV graphs. Visual analysis of the resulting PPV surfaces allowed us to select a score cutoff value with a desired range of PPV.\n\n## Virtual screening\nBased on visual inspections of the resulting of PPV graphs, we have applied an 8-model ensemble using the MIN operator to combine individual models for virtual screening, choosing 0.354 as score threshold (above 0.354 compounds from the screened databases have labeled as predicted active compounds). Such threshold corresponds to a Se/Sp ratio of 0.666. It was checked that every hit belonged to the applicability domain of the model from the model ensemble that assigned the minimum score (which, was, according to our combination scheme, the one that ultimately decided if a compound was or was not labeled as an active). The leverage approach was used to assess if a hit belongs to the applicability domain, using 3d/n as cutoff value, where d is the number of descriptors in the correspondent model and n is the number of compounds in the training set.\nWe have used the 8-model ensemble to screen two databases: (a) DrugBank 4.0, an online database containing extensive information about the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, experimental, nutraceutical, illicit and investigational drugs (Law et al., 2014); (b) Sweetlead, a curated database of drugs approved by other international regulatory agencies, compounds isolated from traditional medicinal herbs, and regulated chemicals (Novick et al., 2013). These two databases were curated using Standardizer 16.10.10.0 (ChemAxon). We have applied the following actions to generate homogeneous representations of the molecular structure for the virtual screening: (1) Strip salts; (2) Remove Solvents; (3) Clear Stereo; (4) Remove Absolute Stereo; (5) Aromatize; (6) Neutralize; (7) Add Explicit Hydrogens; and (8) Clean 2D. Additionally, duplicate structures were removed using Instant JCHEM v. 17.2.6.0. Based in the results obtained and considering the most direct candidates for repositioning, two compounds were selected for experimental evaluation. Hits submitted to experimental testing were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n## Structure-based virtual screening\nThe 24 best solutions from ligand based virtual screening were submitted to molecular docking calculations. To this end we employed as target our 3D model of the putrescine permease TcPAT12 previously constructed (Dietrich et al., 2018). This model was based on the arginine/agmatine antiporter (AdiC) from E. coli as template (Protein data bank accession code: 3L1L, Feng et al., 2000), which was identified through Blast sequence search and showed 23% of sequence identity and 64% coverage of the entire query sequence. The model of TcPAT12 architecture was achieved by Modeller Software (Webb and Sali, 2016). The best model has been selected based on the normalized Discrete Optimized Protein Energy parameter (z-DOPE) (Shen and Sali, 2006) and the GA341 score (which analyze the reliability of a model based on statistical potentials) (Melo and Sali, 2007). This structure had the highest number of residues in allowed area (96%) on Ramachandran plot, and none of the residues located in non-allowed regions were involved in the active site of the transporter.\nThe docking conditions were defined according to our previous studies, which pointed to Autodock4.2 (rigid mode) as the best software to discriminate known inhibitors from non-inhibitors of TcPAT12 through the docking score (Dietrich et al., 2018). The \u201cdocking active site\u201d was set according to previous research of Soysa et al. (2013). They proposed the location of the putrescine-binding pocket in a region that includes Gly69, Cys66, Trp241, Ala244, Asn145, Cys396, Asn245, Tyr148, Tyr400 amino acids. Autodock4.2 calculations were computed in a grid with the default spacing (0.375 A) between the 44 \u00d7 58 \u00d7 40 grid points in x, y, z directions respectively. Additionally, we performed the standard estimation for all the variables such as Marsilli-Gasteiger partial charges. We computed 100 docking runs for each compound, with a rigid target and flexible ligands (allowing the rotation of all non-ring torsion angles of the candidates).\n\n## Biological activity against different \nFor all assays, stock and working solutions of the candidate drugs were prepared using DMSO as solvent and test or control conditions were tested in triplicate.\nEpimastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi were cultured at 28\u00b0C in BHT medium supplemented with 20 ug/ml haemin, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin. The antiproliferative activity of the candidates was tested at concentrations from 1 to 100 \u03bcM in cultures initiated at 107 cells/ml. After 4 and 8 days, the number of viable parasites were counted using a hemocytometer chamber under the light microscope (Bellera et al., 2013). Controls were performed under the same culture conditions with equal concentrations of DMSO as for candidate drugs. The EC50 values were determined from dose response curves fitted to a sigmoidal equation (Boltzmann model) or extrapolated from linear fitting plots (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2013).\nT. cruzi trypomastigotes were purified at the parasitemia peak from peripheral blood of mice infected with the RA strain. Trypomastigotes (1 \u00d7 104 per well) were cultured in a 96 well-plate (final volume 200 \u03bcl) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 24 hours motile parasites were counted in hemocytometer chamber under the light microscope (Miranda et al., 2015). Results were expressed as % viability of trypomastigotes at 20 \u03bcM of the hits. Controls were performed under the same culture conditions with equal concentrations of DMSO as for candidate drugs. The negative control was cultured with PBS and the positive control was cultured with Benznidazole (20 \u03bcM).\nIn vitro evaluation of drug activity against intracellular amastigotes. J774 cells infected with bloodstream trypomastigotes of RA strain were cultured at 37\u00b0C in humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in 24-well plates (1.5 \u00d7 105 cells per well; final volume of 500 \u03bcl in duplicate). After 24 h of incubation, increasing doses of freshly prepared dilutions of benznidazole, meclizine dihydrochloride, cinnarizine, or butoconazole were added at final concentrations of 5, 20, and 50 \u03bcM for meclizine, and cinnarizine and 1, 5, and 20 \u03bcM for butoconazole nitrate. Seventy-two hours later, medium was drained and cells were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold methanol and stained with 10% v/v of Giemsa solution for 15 min. The number of amastigotes per 100 host cells was recorded. Control cultures were incubated in medium alone or with equal DMSO concentrations. Citotoxicity was analyzed in trypsinized cell suspensions, after addition of Propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) (5 \u03bcg/ml) 10 min prior to analysis by fluorescence and light microscopy of the number of viable and dead cells.\n\n## Aminoacid/polyamine transport assay\nAliquots of T. cruzi epimastigotes (3 \u00d7 107 parasites) starved for 3 hs in 2% glucose\u2014phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were collected, centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were then resuspended in 2 ml of PBS containing 5 \u03bcM (14C)-putrescine, or (14C) arginine, and candidates at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcM previously solubilized in DMSO. Aliquots were taken at different time points, centrifuged and washed three times with 1 ml of ice cold 10 mM solution of unlabeled putrescine/arginine in PBS. Pellets were resuspended and radioactivity determined in UltimaGold XR (D\u00edaz et al., 2014). All experiments were performed in triplicate.\nThe effect of the candidate on parasite viability under uptake assay conditions was evaluated through the tetrazolium salt (MTT) reduction assay (Mosmann, 1983). Briefly, 10 \u03bcl of 5 mg/ml MTT dye (3[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added to the eppendorf tubes containing 106 parasites in 100 \u03bcl of BHT and the drug candidates at 50 \u03bcM solubilized in DMSO. After incubation for 3 h at 28\u00b0C, the tubes were spin-dried (3,000 rpm) and the pellet with the formazan crystals were dissolved with 100 \u03bcl of DMSO. The optical density (OD) was determined using a microplate reader (Labsystems Multiskan MS, Finland) at 570/695 nm. Under such conditions, the OD is proportional to the viable cell number in each well. All experiments were performed in triplicate.\n\n## Model development and validation and virtual screening\nTwo serial virtual screening methods were applied to find out putative TcPAT12 inhibitors. First, we resorted to a computationally inexpensive ligand-based approach. For that purpose, 1,000 individual linear classifiers were obtained by applying a random subspace approximation. The individual models were externally validated by using an independent test set and, for a more challenging and realistic simulation, by retrospective screening of a simulated library where a small proportion of active compounds was dispersed among a high number of (mostly putative) decoys. 82, 57, and 25% of the individual classifiers displayed AUC ROCs above 0.8 for the training set, the test set and the simulated DUD-E database, in that order. This suggests some degree of overfitting and corroborates that the pilot (retrospective) screening campaign against the DUD-E database is the more challenging task for the classifiers. Table 1 shows the eight individual classifiers that showed the best performance on the training and test sets, and also on the DUD-E database.\nThe best individual model included the following features:\nDragon's nomenclature for the molecular descriptors has been kept in the previous expression. F06[C-C] refers to the count of C-C at a topological distance of 6; S-107 represents the count of R2S/RS-SR groups; F05[N-N] stands for the frequency of N - N at a topological distance of 5; C-039 refers to Ar-C(= X)-R groups; SM5_B(s) corresponds to the spectral moment of order 5 from the Burden matrix weighted by I-State; Eta_epsi_A is the eta average electronegativity measure; nSO2OH stands for the number of sulfonic (thio-/dithio-) acids; SpMax_H2 is the leading eigenvalue from reciprocal squared distance matrix; Eig04_AEA(ri) denotes the fourth eigenvalue from augmented edge adjacency matrix weighted by resonance integral: ATSC1e corresponds to the Centred Broto-Moreau autocorrelation of lag 1 weighted by Sanderson electronegativity; CATS2D_09_PL is the CATS2D Positive-Positive at lag 09 and; SaaO corresponds to the sum of aaO E-states.\nWhereas the performance of the best individual classifiers was quite satisfactory, we resorted to ensemble learning to obtain meta-classifiers with improved accuracy and a more robust behavior. The expectations on the model combination approach were confirmed statistically: no matter which combination scheme is applied, the model ensembles show a statistically similar behavior to the best individual model when classifying the training and test set compounds, while statistically outperforming the individual models when considering the DUD-E database (p < 0.05 in all cases). The MIN, RANKING and AVERAGE combination schemes led to the best results (Table 1), with p-values below 0.001. When considering the influence of the number of combined models on the AUROC metric, it was observed that although the ensemble learning approach always seems to improve the results in comparison with the individual classifiers, combinations above 10 models tend to poorer behavior in terms of AUROC values but also regarding the standard deviation of the mean, which increases with the number of models included in the ensemble (Figure 3).\nSince all the model combination approaches exhibited similar behavior against the test set and the DUD-E database for relatively low number (below 10) of combined classifiers, we chose to move to the real virtual screening campaign with the combination scheme based on the MIN. In our experience, this is the most conservative approach which tends to display the smallest false positive rate. This was confirmed when comparing Sp and Se of the 8-model meta-classifier with those of the best performing individual models, where a substantial improvement in Sp was observed (Figure 4). This is a particularly good result in our context (small academic group from a mid-income country, with limited resources to invest in hit experimental validation); we often prefer to reduce the false positive rate even if this means losing sensitivity and sacrificing some active scaffolds. However, in this particular case we have chosen to refine the former criteria (prioritizing Sp) by resorting to what we have called PPV surfaces. With the help of these surfaces, the evolution of the most relevant metric for our purposes, the PPV value, can be visually (or, eventually, mathematically) optimized as a function of the Se/Sp ratio across a range of Ya values. For this analysis, we have used the association between Se/Sp and score values that have been observed in the pilot screening campaign. The strongest assumption of our approach is that the Se/Sp value observed for a given score during the pilot screening campaign against the DUD-E database will hold when screening other databases (e.g., the ones screened in real virtual screening applications). This is of course not necessarily true. However, since the AUROC values obtained for the DUD-E database are unequivocally high (always above 0.9 for the individual models and very close to the perfect value of 1 for the ensembles) while on the other hand the DUD-E database Ya ratio (quite below 0.05) and size (>1,000 compounds) speak of a controlled statistical behavior, we believe it is a reasonable assumption in the present setting.\nWhen analyzing the PPV surface for the 8-model combination based on the MIN operator, it was observed that in the current scenario favoring Sp over Se has a positive impact on the PPV, thus resulting in higher probabilities of confirming in silico hits submitted to experimental validation (Figure 5). It should be emphasized that such behavior is not general: other situations linked to different PPV surface shapes might lead to an entirely different conclusion (that is, the need to prioritize Se over Sp to enhance PPV). The selection of the best cutoff value should be based in the specific PPV surface obtained in each particular modeling situation.\nUsing the PPV surface, we chose 0.354 as score threshold to be used in our real virtual screening campaign; such score is associated to a Se/Sp ratio of 0.666 for the 8-model ensemble based on the MIN operator. Whereas higher scores linked to lower Se/Sp",
