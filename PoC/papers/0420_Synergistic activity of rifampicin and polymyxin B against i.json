In 2018, the World Health Organization issued a list of pathogens, colloquially known as ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens, for which new treatments are urgently needed (1). ESKAPE pathogens are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections, with frequent isolates showing multiple drug resistance.\nIn addition to AMR, bacteria can escape the action of antibiotics and the immune system by hiding inside host cells and forming biofilms. The importance of an intracellular niche is increasingly appreciated for some classical extracellular bacteria such as P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and S. aureus (2, 3). Among them, P. aeruginosa is responsible for 10% of hospital-acquired infections (2), especially in intensive care units (4). It is notoriously hard to treat as, besides acquired resistance, P. aeruginosa is intrinsically resistant to many common antibiotics (5). Moreover, P. aeruginosa has been reported to reside intracellularly in vitro in phagocytic (6, 7) and epithelial (8\u201311) cells, as well as in infected mice (12) and patients (13).\nTo tackle hard-to-treat infections, drug combinations have multiple attractive properties. First, they address the urgency\u2014if drugs in combination are approved for human use, it greatly facilitates the transfer from bench to bedside. Second, they surpass and alleviate the scarcity of new chemical scaffolds because new qualitative and quantitative properties emerge from drug combinations. The most beneficial quantitative property of combinations is synergy, that is, the activity of the mixture is greater than expected from the effects of each drug given alone. Synergy also expands the chemotherapy solution space by increasing therapeutic activity, enabling lower dosage, and mitigating the side effects of otherwise unfit monotherapies. Third, combinations can curtail the emergence of AMR by making it harder to evolve resistance (14). Furthermore, as drug interactions could be species-specific (15), they can be used to lessen the selective pressure for AMR and spare the host microbiome. Whether drug combinations have beneficial properties against intracellular forms of bacteria is not well known.\nUnder the Joint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance (JPIAMR) framework (16), we set out to delineate the potential of misused and neglected antibiotics to treat Gram-negative infections (17). Preliminary screenings on various clinical bacterial isolates suggested the utility of the combination of rifampicin and polymyxin B (17\u201319). This combination has been evaluated in the clinics as a promising salvage therapy for multidrug-resistant infections (20\u201322). Rifampicin is a polyketide antibiotic that targets bacterial transcription and is an essential drug in combination against mycobacterial infections (23). Rifampicin has gained considerable attention for its possible interplay with other medications (24). Although antibiotics that accumulate well in bacterial cells are typically amphiphilic (25), rifampicin is large, hydrophobic, and thus poorly permeable in Gram-negative bacteria. However, its uptake is facilitated by membrane-permeabilizing cationic agents such as polymyxins (26). Polymyxin B is a polypeptide antibiotic targeting the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (27).\nBased on these premises, the aim of this study was to investigate whether synergy between rifampicin and polymyxin B also extends to intracellular forms of infection by P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens and explore the possible underlying mechanisms.\nIn brief, we found that the rifampicin-polymyxin B combination is synergistic against intracellular forms of a wide range of ESKAPE bacteria (P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae). Contrasting the results from intracellular infection models and laboratory growth medium, we revealed the synergy-promoting role of the acidic pH prevailing in intracellular compartments. To account for the synergy in molecular terms, we identified and characterized P. aeruginosa mutants with altered membrane properties and pronounced oxidative damage when exposed to the combination.\n\n## The rifampicin-polymyxin B combination is synergistic against intracellular \nWorking first with the P. aeruginosa reference strain ATCC 27853 and using the broth microdilution method to determine the lowest concentration of no turbidity, we measured the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of rifampicin and polymyxin B to be 16 and 2 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Using the MIC to orient ourselves in the concentration space, we then resolved each drug\u2019s extra- and intra-cellular pharmacodynamics alone or in combination by following colony-forming units (CFU). In particular, we estimated the concentration-dependent effect of drugs after 24 h (i) in the intracellular infection model (6) and (ii) in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (Fig. 1A). Assuming a shared Emin (carrying capacity of the condition) and fixing slope at 1, we fit a four-parametric concentration-response curve to the monotherapies to estimate the efficacy (Emax, maximal drug response) and potency (EC50, the inflection point of the four-parametric Hill curve, that is, the concentration producing 50% of the maximal response) of a given drug (Fig. 1A). Finally, we used the Loewe model to quantify the interaction of two drugs in combination (28). Loewe\u2019s model assumes dose additivity, calculating the expected response as if the two drugs are the same. This approach was preferred to the widely used fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) method, which is particularly prone to reproducibility problems and influenced by the way concentrations are selected to calculate interactions (29).\nWhen used alone, in line with previous observations of attenuated intracellular activity for a wide variety of antibiotics (6, 30), polymyxin B exhibited three orders of magnitude higher maximal efficacy in broth (MHBII, pH 7.4) compared with intracellular conditions (Fig. 1B vs Fig. 1C, 2A; Fig. S1B). In contrast, rifampicin had two orders of magnitude lower efficacy in broth (MHBII, pH 7.4) compared with intracellular bacteria (Fig. 1B vs C and 2A; Fig. S1A). At the same time, the potency of both drugs (quantified as EC50) remained unaltered and close to their broth MICs across both environments (Fig. 2B).\nThe combination of rifampicin and polymyxin B was synergistic against intracellular forms of P. aeruginosa, most notably at the concentration of 0.3 times the MIC of rifampicin (Fig. 1B). In stark contrast, this interaction disappeared in broth (MHBII, pH 7.4; Fig. 1C).\nSince intracellular P. aeruginosa is located in the vacuoles (6), we hypothesized that the low pH might improve the efficacy of rifampicin and increase the synergy of the combination. To test this idea, we attempted to acidify the broth using HCl. Contrary to the common notion of environmental acidification by various microorganisms (32), P. aeruginosa neutralized the acidified broth within 9 h (Fig. S1G).\nUpon buffered acidification of the medium (pH 5.5 by 100 mM MES) to maintain the acidic pH throughout the experiment (Fig. S1G), (i) the concentration-response curve of rifampicin became superimposable to that observed in the intracellular environment (Fig. S1A), (ii) the maximal efficacy of rifampicin increased by 1.5 orders of magnitude (Fig. 2A; Fig. S1A), and (iii) synergy was re-established (Fig. 1C vs D), although curiously centered around the MIC of polymyxin B. In addition, observing the kinetics of bacterial killing in time, intracellular and broth at pH 5.5 were more similar to each other and distinct from broth at pH 7.4 (Fig. S2), altogether suggesting that acidified broth might more closely resemble the intracellular environment of P. aeruginosa.\nRegardless of the effect on rifampicin\u2019s concentration-response and restoration of the synergy of the two-drug combination, the acidification of broth also brought about a similar increase in the efficacy of polymyxin B by one order of magnitude (Fig. 2A; Fig. S1B). In addition, the shared increase in efficacy upon acidification of broth was coupled to increased potency (lower EC50) of both drugs (Fig. 2B). The discrepancy between the favorable effect of acidic pH on polymyxin B activity in broth and polymyxin B\u2019s low intracellular efficacy (Fig. 2B; Fig. S1B) prompted us to explore if pH contributes to the efficacy of intracellular killing of bacteria inside vacuoles. Indeed, increasing the vacuolar pH by chloroquine (33) decreased the efficacy of both polymyxin B and rifampicin (Fig. S1E and F). This suggests that the intracellular activity of polymyxin B is low despite the potentiating effect of acidic pH in the vacuole.\nTo establish if our findings apply more broadly to other strains of P. aeruginosa, we tested another reference strain (PAO1) and a clinical isolate (PA04/202; Fig. S3), rifampicin-resistant laboratory strains (Fig. S11; PA14 and isogenic mutants with a > 40-times higher intracellular EC50 for rifampicin, Fig. 2B), and polymyxin B-resistant clinical isolates (Fig. S12; 80\u2013120 times higher intracellular EC50 for polymyxin B, Fig. 2B). Across all the strains, the results were similar to ATCC27853: (i) polymyxin B had higher efficacy in broth compared with intracellular environment, (ii) rifampicin\u2019s efficacy was never higher in broth, and (iii) intracellular synergy of combining the two drugs was unequivocal. Most importantly, the synergy was not interrupted by resistance towards individual drugs (Fig. S11 and S12). Acidification enhanced synergy in all strains except PA14, where the effect was negligible. Overall, only the potentiating effect of pH on mono-treatments did not generalize from ATCC27853 to other P. aeruginosa strains.\n\n## The combination is synergistic against a range of intracellular Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens\nGiven the increased efficacy of the rifampicin-polymyxin B combination on intracellular P. aeruginosa, we asked if this generalizes to intracellular forms of other ESKAPE Gram-negative bacteria, namely A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli.\nAcross other ESKAPE pathogens, similarly to P. aeruginosa, although polymyxin B was more effective in broth compared with the intracellular environment, rifampicin\u2019s efficacy in broth was less or similar to that in the intracellular context (Fig. 2A; Fig. S4 to S6). Acidification had a negligible effect on Emax and, if anything, decreased the efficacy of both drugs.\nRegarding single-drug potencies (Fig. 2B), acidification had no effect against E. coli and increased the potency of rifampicin only against A. baumannii (seven times). In contrast, low pH decreased the potency of polymyxin B against K. pneumoniae (12\u201330 times) and A. baumannii (6\u20137 times). Finally, rifampicin showed good activity against A. baumannii\u2014compared with P. aeruginosa ATCC27853, rifampicin was some 8 times (EC50 about 2 mg/L in intracellular and neutral broth) to 20 times (EC50 0.3 mg/L in acidic broth) more potent against both isolates of A. baumannii (Fig. S2B).\nThe drug combination was synergistic against all three species, and, excluding clinically irrelevant high concentrations, synergy was generally at or around the MICs of the two drugs. The effect of pH on synergies was concordant with P. aeruginosa\u2014at pH 5.5, compared with pH 7.4, there were more synergistic locations across the tested concentration space (Fig. S7A). The only mild exceptions were A. baumannii A113 and P. aeruginosa PA04/202, for which the number of synergistic concentrations decreased slightly upon acidification.\nTaken together, the rifampicin-polymyxin B combination is synergistic against intracellular clinical isolates of A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli (Fig. 3), with a relevant synergy region in concentration space at or around the drugs' MIC. Lowering pH increases the potency of rifampicin against A. baumannii and enhances synergy against all three species.\n\n## Reverse genetics identifies mutants with altered sensitivity against rifampicin-polymyxin B combination\nWe turned to chemical genetics (34) to account for the synergy in molecular terms\u2014potentially beyond a nonspecific increase in membrane permeability by polymyxin B. To date, an ordered transposon library is not available for ATCC27853 but has been established for P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 (35, 36) and PA14 (31). We chose PA14 because it forms less biofilm than PAO1 (37), which makes it a better strain for quantifying growth\u2060 (the potential of combination to fight biofilm, an important clinical issue, is out of scope for the current study). In addition, PA14 is a highly virulent strain capable of infecting mammalian hosts and invertebrates, making it an attractive model for studying P. aeruginosa infection.\nAlthough the PA14 strain had dramatically reduced sensitivity towards rifampicin, we decided to continue with the Tn-library because, apart from elevated MIC, insensitivity did not affect synergy (Fig. S11). In addition, preliminary tests on agar medium showed that the PA14 library strain\u2019s growth\u2014that is, the readout for chemical genetics\u2014was inhibited by rifampicin at sub-MIC concentrations (levels close to the MIC of other P. aeruginosa strains). The primary and frequent mechanism for rifampicin resistance is point mutations in RNA polymerase (rpoB gene), each of which gradually reduces the binding affinity of rifampicin, causing the drug to dissociate from RNA polymerase (24, 38). Any fitness cost of such mutations is easily offset by compensatory mutations (39, 40), arguably minimizing any polar/secondary effects of the resistance.\nWe pinned the P. aeruginosa transposon library on agar media prepared with or without antibiotics; we used regular LB and LB buffers at pH 5.5 by 100 mM MES in parallel (for details, see Materials and Methods). We took pictures of the plates after incubation for 12 h at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4A) and analyzed the images using Iris (41). Using colony opacity as a proxy for growth, we derived fitness\u2014a relative growth in a given condition compared with the same mutant on a no-drug plate. Such a comparison of the mutant with itself allows us to estimate the treatment effect without interference from its proclivity for growth and the effects of position within a plate (42).\nCombining results from neutral (Fig. S8A) and pH 5.5 (Fig. S8B) media, we found 57 mutants with altered sensitivity to the rifampicin-polymyxin B concentration. This entails 53 different genes. The difference between the numbers reflects the library composition\u2014some mutants have the transposon landing site in other parts of the same gene (three of the 53 genes were hit by three, two, and two transposons, respectively). A discordant phenotype between same-gene mutants arises with a high frequency for multiple reasons, most notably due to the more or less dispensable nature of different regions of the same gene. However, if such mutants have a concordant phenotype, it increases the statistical power to call the gene a hit. In doing so, performing the analysis at the gene level, we found 17 additional genes inflicted. That said, we limited our analysis to the initial 53 genes (to work directly with the mutants from the library in the following experiments).\nGO term enrichment analysis pointed to membrane processes\u2014including the known polymyxin resistance element pmrB (43, 44)\u2014and metabolism (Tables S1 and S2). Protein-protein interaction networks insinuated the same (Fig. S8C). In addition, P. aeruginosa harbors 12 resistance-nodulation-division (RND) type efflux systems, of which the best studied MexAB-OprM (5) is constitutively expressed and confers resistance to a wide range of structurally diverse antimicrobials (45). Accordingly, we identified that mexB had an increased sensitivity towards the combination.\nOf the 53 genes, we next interrogated the 45 strongest affected mutants in liquid medium (LB Lennox) following growth by optical density at multiple drug concentrations. Briefly, the stationary phase culture was diluted 100-fold in LB (pH 7.4), distributed 30 \u00b5L/well at 384 wells per microtiter plate density, and growth was monitored by measuring OD620 every 30 min. We derived dose-response curves from areas under the log-transformed growth curve up to 15 h (Fig. S9) and calculated the drug-drug interaction score (as described in Materials and Methods).\nOf the 45 transposon mutants closely examined in the liquid growth assay, 14 showed altered sensitivity to the drug combination (Fig. 4B; Table 1; Fig. S10). Seven had decreased synergy (four with less synergy, and three had lost all synergy), whereas the other seven had increased synergy. We excluded one mutant (transposon in sahH) from the analysis as it grew poorly in liquid broth. Nine of the genes had been characterized (relA, 26590, lldP, 60490, 03760, 43270, maiA, 43670, and pmbA), and five genes were hypothetical (02150, 66480, 56840, 51310, and 62230); for the latter, we provide the description based on conserved protein domains (Table 1). Four of the nine characterized had known E. coli orthologs (relA, glcA, selU, and pmbA) (Table 1).\n\n## Identified mutants have altered inner and outer membranes\nHaving used two different growth-based assays to identify 53 mutants (by colony size at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5) and validate (by turbidity in liquid medium at pH 7.4) 14 mutants with altered sensitivity toward the combination, we next interrogated the drug-drug interaction in a concentration-resolved manner on the killing of bacteria (i) in intracellular infection experiment, (ii) in broth at pH 7.4, and (iii) in broth at pH 5.5. In addition, we further delineated some physiological properties of five mutants (relA, 26590, 02150, 66480, and 43270).\nAlthough not vastly different from wild-type, mutants with a transposon in 43270 and 66480 had more and fewer regions of synergy, respectively (Fig. S11). The killing of mutants\u2014during intracellular infection, in broth at pH 7.4, and in broth at pH 5.5\u2014was thus concordant with our growth-based validation experiments (Fig. 4B; Fig. S9 and S10).\nWe next asked if mutants differ in their sensitivity toward the combination due to altered permeability of the outer membrane (OM), inner membrane (IM), or both, using nitrocefin and propidium iodide (PI) assay, respectively. Nitrocefin is a chromogenic substrate that cannot cross intact OM; however, when the OM is disrupted, nitrocefin reaches the periplasmic space, where periplasmic \u03b2-lactamases hydrolyze it, changing its color from yellow to red (46). PI is a dye that shows a 20-fold to 30-fold increase in fluorescence when it binds to DNA or RNA, but it cannot cross intact bacterial membranes (neither OM nor IM).\nRegarding outer membrane permeability (Fig. 4C), there was no difference between mutants at the lowest (0.1 mg/L) and highest (2 mg/L) polymyxin B concentrations. However, the outer membrane of mutant 43270 was significantly more sensitive to polymyxin B at intermediate concentrations than that of the wild-type (or the rest of the mutants). Conversely, 02150 and 26590 were less sensitive than the wild-type. The relative sensitivity pattern was similar to that of polymyxin B nonapeptide (Fig. S13A), a 100-fold less bactericidal derivative of polymyxin B (47), suggesting that the effects we observed are independent of the killing activity of polymyxin B.\nRegarding inner membrane permeability (Fig. 4D), for polymyxin B at 1\u00d7 MIC\u2014whether alone or combined with rifampicin\u2014mutant 43270 was more sensitive. In contrast, relA, 26590, and 02150 were less sensitive. Transposon insertion in relA and 26590 reduced inner membrane permeabilization by 25%, protecting against polymyxin B and the rifampicin-polymyxin B combination.\nIn conclusion, when exposed to polymyxin B alone or combined with rifampicin, the isolated mutants show a positive correlation between the synergy and IM/OM permeabilization. However, these mutants were indistinguishable in terms of binding of polymyxin B to lipid A of the LPS (Fig. S13B), inner membrane depolarization (Fig. S13D), and, quite intriguingly, of rifampicin accumulation (Fig. S13E).\n\n## Identified mutants more sensitive to the rifampicin-polymyxin B combination show higher ROS production and lipid peroxidation when exposed to the combination\nAlthough many mutants with more regions of synergy have unidentified defects, we noticed that one of them, namely 43270, harbors mutations in tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of tRNA modifications in cellular stress responses. For example, tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase is crucial for maintaining translational accuracy and cellular stress adaptation by modifying wobble uridine, which enhances codon recognition and protein synthesis fidelity. Loss of this function can lead to increased mistranslation, resulting in protein misfolding and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress (48, 49). Accordingly, the analysis of GO terms highlights oxidative stress, with the top two terms related to it (Table S2). Lipids are one of the targets of oxidative damage (50). We therefore wondered whether synergy in the rifampicin-polymyxin B combination could occur through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and membrane lipid peroxidation. ROS levels were detected using the oxidation-sensitive probe DCF (51) and lipid peroxidation by following the shift from red to green fluorescence of C11-BODIPY581/591 (52). A significant increase in ROS levels was observed in all strains exposed to the combination of rifampicin and polymyxin B compared with those exposed to a single drug, but the difference was markedly higher in mutants with more regions of synergy (03760, 43270, maiA, and 43670) (Fig. 5A). Higher levels of lipid peroxidation were also measured in these same mutants following combined treatment with rifampicin and polymyxin B (Fig. 5B). This more marked shift of red to green fluorescence of C11-BODIPY581/591 indicative of lipid peroxidation was confirmed in flow cytometry (Fig. 5C) and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 5D and E).\nThese results suggest that oxidative stress may play a key role in the enhanced bactericidal activity observed with the combination therapy.\n\n## DISCUSSION\nCombining polymyxins and rifampicin is one of the most discussed treatments against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (53). We report here that the rifampicin and polymyxin B combination shows potent synergy against P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae (Fig. 1B through D and 3; Figs. S3 to S6), including intracellular forms of bacteria and their clinical isolates. As reported previously for colistin (54, 55), synergy is retained even against the polymyxin B and rifampicin-resistant strains (Figs. S11 and S12).\nWe reveal that rifampicin (i) has good efficacy against A. baumannii, and (ii) contrary to other antibiotics, it is a drug with similar or higher potency and efficacy in an intracellular environment compared with a neutral laboratory medium. We show for P. aeruginosa that the medium at pH 5.5 might be a better approximation for the intracellular environment than the same medium at pH 7.4, both for the concentration-response relationship (Fig. S1A) and when following treatment effect in time (Fig. S2).\nThe effect of acidification, however, is more complex. Previous studies show that low pH increases the effectiveness of rifampicin against Mycobacterium smegmatis (56), and similar effects are seen here in P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii (Fig. 2B). However, acidification does not affect rifampicin potency against E. coli and actually reduces the potency of polymyxin B against K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii (Fig. 2B). In contrast, lowering the pH increases polymyxin B effectiveness in P. aeruginosa, that is, further amplifying the difference between the intracellular environment and broth. This makes an acidic medium, rather than a neutral one, less suitable specifically for studying polymyxin B intracellular pharmacodynamics.\nCompared with neutral broth, synergy is potentiated by an acidic environment, that is, in an intracellular environment and an acidic broth (Fig. S7). Importantly, we observe that synergy increases the potency of the treatment, that is, around the MIC of the mono-treatments. In contrast, the synergistic gain in efficacy is of secondary importance as it happens at physiological unfeasibly high drug concentrations, if at all.\nWe identified a set of transposon mutants with altered sensitivity toward the combination. As polymyxin B targets membranes and rifampicin affects transcription, the identified mutants have an insertion in genes primarily involved in the two processes.\nAll the mutants without discernible synergy had transposon insertion in transcription regulators (Fig. 4B): (i) relA encodes a (p)ppGpp synthetase, a stringent response regulator that orchestrates bacterial transcription at the global level (57\u201359); (ii) 02150 is a regulator of sigma subunit of RNA polymerase, as suggested by a domain from the family of serine phosphatase RsbU (60); and (iii) 26590 encodes a transcription factor from the GntR family.\nFast-growing bacteria have a set of genes transcribed at a high rate, which RelA rapidly curtails upon perturbations (57\u201359), driving the accumulation of (p)ppGpp (61). Our current work suggests that perturbation of such capacity renders strains more sensitive to both rifampicin and polymyxin B (Fig. S9) as if removing an obstacle that synergy overcomes. This generic explanation lacks details for now, except that relA defective strains have altered inner membrane permeability (Fig. 4D). Curiously, a line of work connects the effect of rifampicin and the stringent response over the shared effect on replication (62, 63), and the accumulation of nucleotides and amino acids during the combination treatment (64, 65) suggests that cells are in a state of metabolic and/or growth arrest.\nAlthough we could not observe a difference in rifampicin uptake for identified mutants, they had altered membrane properties (Fig. 4C and D) and showed higher ROS levels and lipid peroxidation when exposed to the rifampicin-polymyxin B combination (Fig. 5), which correlates with the susceptibility toward the combination (Fig. 4B). The potential role of oxidative stress was also supported by the GO term enrichment analysis of chemical-genetics experiments (Table S2). Of note, the oxidative stress induced by polymyxins and rifampicin may promote the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ via the Fenton reaction (66). This warrants further investigation, as ferroptosis has been implicated in acute kidney injury caused by polymyxins (67) and in the rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity (68).\nSome limitations of our work need to be acknowledged. Most of the genes associated with modified susceptibility to the drug combination in the transposon library code for proteins with unknown functions, preventing us from further investigating their potential link with the observed phenotype. Also, we did not extend our study to other polymyxins or rifamycins. Finally, we used a single model of phagocytic cells for intracellular infection and cannot exclude that the fate of bacteria may differ in other cell types, potentially influencing the extent of the synergies observed here.\nOverall, our work indicates that rifampicin could be refactored as a potent agent against hard-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria if administered together with sub-MIC concentrations of polymyxin B, including against intracellular forms of infection. Importantly, our data suggest a link between membrane structure alterations and oxidative damage sensitivity, further emphasizing the therapeutic potential of leveraging such stress responses in combating multidrug-resistant infections. An exciting future direction could explore whether replacing polymyxins with other antimicrobial peptides (69, 70) leads to similar or even better synergistic effects.\n\n## Reagents and media\nCation-adjusted Mueller Hinton, LB Lennox, and tryptic soy broth (TSB) were procured by Sigma. Solid media had 1.5% (wt/vol) agar (BD), except for chemical genetics, where agar was at 2% (wt/vol). The low pH version was obtained by acidification using HCl or by adding MES (Carl Roth) to pH 5.5 at 100 mM final. Rifampicin (Sigma; potency, 100%) stock was prepared in DMSO, and polymyxin B (Sigma; potency, 75%) and gentamicin (Sigma; potency, 65%) were prepared in water; subsequent dilutions were done in water or medium. In the case of experimental rifampicin concentrations higher than 1\u00d7 MIC, the agar medium used for CFU counting was supplemented with 2 g/L charcoal powder to avoid the carry-over effect (Fig. S1C and D [71]). RPMI-1640 (Thermo) medium was used with or without 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma).\n\n## Bacterial strains\nP. aeruginosa reference strains ATCC27853, PAO1 (ATCC), and PA14 (36) were used. Clinical isolates, provided by Denis Pierard or Johan W. Mouton, included P. aeruginosa strains PA04/202, PA947, and PA1292; K. pneumoniae strains K74 and K58; E. coli strains E51 and E15; and A. baumannii strains A112 and A113.\n\n## Intracellular infection\nIntracellular infection of human THP-1 monocytic cells (ATCC) was performed as previously described (6), with cells used between the 5th and the 14th passages. Infected cells were then aliquoted 2 mL/well on 12-well plates with the appropriate antibiotics (alone or in combination) added to the wells at desired concentrations, incubated with antibiotics, and harvested as previously described (6). Bacterial abundance in CFU/mL was determined by colony counting after 24 h (and 48 h to capture late-appearing col",
