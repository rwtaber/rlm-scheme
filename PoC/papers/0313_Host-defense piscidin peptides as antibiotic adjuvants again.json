Piscidins 1 (p1) and 3 (p3), cationic host defense peptides with micromolar cytotoxicity against C. difficile, sensitize C. difficile to clinically relevant antibiotics tested at sublethal concentrations. Both peptides bind to Cu2+ using an amino terminal copper and nickel binding motif. Here, we investigate the two peptides in the apo and holo states as antibiotic adjuvants against an epidemic strain of C. difficile. We find that the presence of the peptides leads to lower doses of metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin to kill C. difficile. The activity of metronidazole, which targets DNA, is enhanced by a factor of 32 when combined with p3, previously shown to bind and condense DNA. Conversely, the activity of vancomycin, which acts at bacterial cell walls, is enhanced 64-fold when combined with membrane-active p1-Cu2+. As shown through microscopy monitoring the permeabilization of membranes of C. difficile cells and vesicle mimics of their membranes, the adjuvant effect of p1 and p3 in the apo and holo states is consistent with a mechanism of action where the peptides enable greater antibiotic penetration through the cell membrane to increase their bioavailability. The variations in effects obtained with the different forms of the peptides reveal that while all piscidins generally sensitize C. difficile to antibiotics, co-treatments can be optimized in accordance with the underlying mechanism of action of the peptides and antibiotics.

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nThe anaerobic spore-forming intestinal pathogen Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infects the mammalian large bowel and releases protein toxins, resulting in diarrheal infections with a profound effect on health care costs and patient quality of life[1,2]. In the United States alone, it is responsible for nearly 500,000 infections, 25,000 deaths, and approximately $6 billion in hospitalization costs per year [1]. One fourth to one third of C. difficile infection (CDI) patients experience recurrent infection, and each round of failed antibiotic therapy increases the risk of recurrence from 30% after a first infection to 45% and 64%, respectively after the second and third occurrences, in a so-called \u2018recurrence elevator\u2019 [3]. On average, an initial CDI diagnosis increases an individual patient\u2019s health care costs by $24,000, while each additional recurrence costs $28,000-$60,000, with the overall burden on the U.S. health care estimated to be $5\u20136 billion per year [4,5]. Prior exposure to antibiotics such as clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones that disrupt the commensal gut microbiota is the single largest risk factor for CDI, although many other factors such as proton pump inhibitor usage and advanced age contribute to the risk of infection [6]. While CDI has historically been a health-care associated infection, community acquired CDI is becoming more prevalent [7]. C. difficile persists in the environment and spreads between patients in the form of metabolically dormant spores, which are impervious to antibiotics that target metabolic or biosynthetic processes [8]. Plasma membranes within spores are highly compressed and less dynamic and permeable to exogenous materials than cell membranes in germinated spores or vegetative cells [8,9].\nUntil recently, the leading antibiotic treatment for CDI was metronidazole, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that inhibits nucleic acid synthesis [10\u201312]. However, metronidazole has lost clinical efficacy due to the emergence of resistant C. difficile strains and as of 2017 is no longer recommended as a front-line therapy against CDI [11,12]. Nevertheless, it is still widely prescribed, possibly due to financial considerations [13]. Vancomycin, which inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and is specific to Gram-positive bacteria, is the currently recommended treatment for initial CDI diagnosis [11,12]. Clostridial vancomycin resistance is not currently widespread but has been documented and appears to be increasing as metronidazole usage is replaced by vancomycin, increasing the selective pressure favoring vancomycin resistance [13\u201316]. Fidaxomicin, a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits transcription initiation by RNA polymerase, treats CDI with lower recurrence rates than vancomycin or metronidazole but is not widely prescribed, likely due to its relatively high cost [12,13,17,18]. Clinical isolates of C. difficile with reduced fidaxomicin susceptibility have been isolated, suggesting that fidaxomicin-resistant CDI will be medically relevant in the future [16,19].\nCurrently, the most clinically effective treatment for CDI is the replenishment of the protective gut microbiota through fecal transplants. This procedure has a high risk of introducing other pathogens. Given the risk of this approach for immunocompromised patients, there is heightened interest in developing new strategies to prevent and treat CDI [20]. Alleviating the symptoms of infection by neutralizing the clostridial toxins is one active area of research [21]. Combinatorial treatments exploiting synergy between agents that are independently bacteriostatic or bactericidal are another promising field of research, as bacteria would need to evolve two separate resistance mechanisms to successfully evade such treatments [22,23].\nHost-defense peptides (HDPs), found in all classes of life, are small, typically cationic, peptides which are produced as an endogenous defense mechanism against pathogens [24\u201330]. HDPs kill bacteria by a number of mechanisms, including disruption of cell membrane structural integrity and penetration into the bacterial cytoplasm to attack intracellular targets [22,31\u201339]. Models of membrane-active HDPs suggest potential mechanisms ranging from horizontal peptide insertion within the lipid phase to the formation of transient transmembrane pores [22,40\u201342]. HDPs are attractive candidates for synergistic interactions with antibiotics, as they have a non-specific electrostatic affinity for the negatively charged lipid headgroups in bacterial cell membranes, to which it would be difficult for bacteria to evolve specific resistance mechanisms [22]. HDPs with high membrane activity are more likely to exhibit antibiotic synergy, suggesting that they could permeabilize the bacterial cell membrane and increase antibiotic penetrance and bioavailability [43]. The human HDPs LL-37 and HBD3 perturb C. difficile cell membrane integrity and increase susceptibility to multiple classes of antibiotics, including tetracylines [44\u201348]. Even some fluoroquinoline and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, which are normally ineffective against C. difficile and associated with increased CDI susceptibility, exhibit synergistic interactions with HDPs to kill C. difficile [45,47].\nPiscidins are cationic HDPs found in fish that exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in anaerobic environments and are bactericidal against C. difficile in anaerobic environments [42,49\u201356]. Piscidins are known to target bacterial cell membranes, forming \u03b1-helices upon membrane binding and physically inserting themselves into the lipid bilayer and causing oxidative damage to component lipids [42,51,52,57\u201363]. They have garnered biomedical interest due to the strong potency and favorable therapeutic indexes of naturally-occurring piscidins and some analogs [63\u201365]. Most piscidins have an amino terminal copper and nickel binding motif that enables them to bind to Cu2+ with nanomolar affinity, resulting in nuclease activity against intracellular DNA [52,55,59,66]. Piscidin 1 (p1) is more active against membranes while piscidin 3 (p3) is a more potent nuclease [52,58]. Piscidins are capable of permeabilizing membranes from cells and synthetic lipid vesicles made to model the cell membranes, and this effect is enhanced by metal binding [42,57,58,62,67,68].\nWe have previously shown that p1 and p3 are cytotoxic against both historical and modern epidemic strains of C. difficile [53]. Both peptides associate with clostridial cells at sites of membrane curvature and effectively kill C. difficile at micromolar concentrations [53]. p1 is effective at lower concentrations in vitro than p3. p1 inhibits clostridial growth and kills exponentially growing C. difficile at 4 \u03bcM while p3 is active at 8 \u03bcM, comparable to the 2\u20134 \u03bcM effective concentrations achieved against C. difficile by hybrid peptides based on porcine and bee HDPs [53,69]. In anaerobic environments, the apo- and metallated piscidins were equally effective, suggesting that the increased oxidative potential of piscidin-copper complexes compared to the peptides alone depends on atmospheric oxygen [53]. Here, we hypothesized that as piscidins are active at the cell membrane, they could help resuscitate the activity of antibiotics against C. difficile by facilitating access to their targets. We investigated the co-application of sublethal concentrations of piscidins with antibiotics commonly used to treat CDI and determined that the HDPs can increase the efficacy of medically relevant antibiotics against C. difficile. To explain this adjuvant effect, we performed mechanistic studies with cells and model membranes, and used antibiotics featuring different targets (e.g., cell wall versus intracellular targets).\n\n## Materials, chemicals, bacterial strains, and growth conditions\nAll materials were purchased from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise indicated. C. difficile R20291 was cultured in BHI (Brain-Heart Infusion; VWR) medium supplemented with 5% Bacto Yeast Extract (Thermo Fisher Scientific) [70]. C. difficile was cultured anaerobically at 37\u00b0C in a Coy Type B vinyl anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI) with an atmosphere of 85% N2, 10% CO2, 5% H2. All plastic consumables were equilibrated in the anaerobic chamber for a minimum of 72 h prior to use. C. difficile was exposed to ciprofloxacin (Cayman Chemicals), erythromycin (Acros Organics), fidaxomicin (Cayman Chemicals), metronidazole (BTC), vancomycin (VWR), or Cu2SO4 (MP Biomedicals) at the indicated concentrations. Taurocholic acid (Sigma Life Science) was added to BHIS agar plates at a concentration of 0.1% for spore germination.\n\n## Peptide synthesis\nThe piscidin peptides p1 and p3 were prepared using previously established protocols [42,52\u201354,71]. Briefly, the peptides were synthesized at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Houston, TX, USA) and Bio-Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX, USA). Following synthesis by Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis and purification (>95%) by reverse phase HPLC, the lyophilized peptides were solubilized in dilute hydrochloric acid to exchange the trifluoroacetate ions for chloride ions. To remove any excess salt, dialysis was carried out. To prepare the samples for biological assays, the dialyzed peptides were dissolved in water and their concentration determined by amino acid analysis performed by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at Texas A&M University (College Station, TX, USA) or Amino Acid Analysis Service Laboratory (Damascus, OR, USA). Consistent results were obtained when identical stocks were analyzed by both laboratories. To prepare the peptide-Cu2+ constructs, a 1:1 stoichiometric amount of CuCl2 was added to each peptide. To ensure optimal conditions for metal binding, the pH of the solution, which tends to drop due to the deprotonation of the four nitrogen sites involved in metal coordination, was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH. The samples were frozen and stored at \u201020\u00b0C until needed.\n\n## Growth inhibition assays\nTwo-fold serial dilutions of BHIS media containing the indicated concentrations of antibiotics were prepared in sterile 96 well plates (ThermoFisher Scientific). Piscidins and piscidin-Cu2+ complexes were added at a concentration of 2 \u03bcM for p1 and p1-Cu2+ and 4 \u03bcM for p3 and p3- Cu2+, 0.5X the previous determined inhibitory concentrations [53]. Wells were inoculated 1:10 with exponentially growing C. difficile R20291 cultures (OD600 0.4\u20130.6). Inoculated plates were incubated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C for 16 h and then removed from the chamber. Plate exteriors were sanitized with bleach and culture density was measured at 630 nm in a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader (Winooski, VT). Effective antibiotic concentrations were defined as those sufficient to inhibit overnight growth in the presence of peptides by at least 90% compared to untreated controls containing no peptides or antibiotics. All experiments were performed with a minimum of three samples, and the means and standard deviations were reported. To analyze the effects of the antibiotics, samples containing peptides and antibiotics were compared to samples containing only peptides by two-way analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism 6.\n\n## Enumeration of colony forming units\n200 \u03bcL samples of BHIS broth containing the indicated concentrations of antibiotics and/or piscidins were inoculated using a 1:10 ratio, in 96 well plates, with exponentially growing C. difficile R20291 cells and incubated for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. Samples were spread as duplicates on BHIS agar plates containing 20 \u03bcg/mL erythromycin. These plates were incubated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C for 48 h before the viable colonies were counted.\n\n## Spore viability assays\nTo isolate spores, exponentially growing C. difficile R20291 was inoculated 1:10 into 50 mL of BHIS broth and grown anaerobically at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. This culture was removed from anaerobic chamber and ethanol was added to a final concentration of 50%. The sample was rocked aerobically for 6 h. The absence of viable vegetative cells was confirmed by spreading volumes up to 1 mL on BHIS plates and incubating anaerobically for 48 h. 100 \u03bcL samples of R20291 spores in PBS were mixed 1:1 with PBS or with PBS containing p1 or p3. Peptides were tested at final concentrations corresponding to 1X and 2X their previously observed inhibitory concentrations. All the samples were incubated in the chamber at 37\u00b0C for 16 hrs. After incubation, 50 \u03bcL aliquots of each sample were plated in triplicate on BHIS plates containing 20 \u03bcg/mL erythromycin and 0.1% taurocholic acid agar plates to induce germination [72]. An additional 50 \u03bcL aliquot was plated on BHIS containing 20 \u03bcg/mL erythromycin to ensure that there was no contamination with vegetative cells. The plates were incubated in the chamber at 37\u00b0C for 48 h before the viable colonies were counted.\n\n## Propidium iodide uptake assays\n4 mL samples of C. difficile cultures in late exponential growth (OD600 0.7\u20130.8) were treated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C with 20 \u03bcg/mL propidium iodide (PI; Biotium) and inhibitory concentrations of piscidins or piscidin-copper complexes (4 \u03bcM for p1 and p1Cu, 8 \u03bcM for p3 and p3Cu). Samples containing apo-peptides and metalated peptides were incubated for 30 min and 10 min, respectively. After incubation, cells were centrifuged at 704 rfc for 5 minutes and resuspended in 1.5 mL fresh BHIS broth. Negative controls were incubated with PI for 10 or 30 minutes but contained no piscidin. Positive controls were removed from the anaerobic chamber and incubated aerobically for 1 h at room temperature with propidium iodine and 50% ethanol. Within the anaerobic chamber, samples were injected into rose chambers for microscopic imaging as detailed in [53]. The rose chambers were removed from the anaerobic chamber and the outsides were sterilized with 70% ethanol and 10% bleach. Samples were imaged on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with Nikon Perfect Focus System, apochromat TIRF 60X Oil Immersion Objective Lens (numerical aperture 1.49), a condenser (numerical aperture 0.52), pco.edge 4.2 LT sCMOS camera, and SOLA SE II 365 Light Engine as well as complementary DIC components. Stage temperature was maintained at 36.5\u00b0C +/\u2212 0.5\u00b0C using a Nevtek Air Stream microscope stage warmer and home-built microscope enclosure. Samples were imaged with time-lapse differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and propidium iodide was monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths of 535/617 nm.\n\n## Membrane leakage assays\nThe synthetic lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-(\u03b2-D-glucosyl)-sn-glycerol ((16:1\u201318:1) DG-glucose) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). POPG and DG-glucose (4 \u03bcmol of total lipids) dissolved in chloroform were mixed in a 2:1 molar ratio prior to drying under a flow of nitrogen. After overnight drying under vacuum, the lipid film was hydrated with 300 \u03bcL of 80 mM calcein dye and 4 freeze-thaw cycles were carried out. Next, large unilamelar vesicles (LUVs) were made by extruding the lipid mixture through a 0.1 \u03bcM polycarbonate membrane filter (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ). To remove the free calcein dye, the LUVs were run through a size exclusion Sephadex G-50 column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). The mobile phase featured HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100mM NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.01% w/v NaN3, pH 7.4). The LUVs were then diluted (1:25 dilution) to approximately 30 \u03bcM and aliquoted in a 96 well plate (180 \u03bcL per well). The precise concentration of POPG, which made up 66% of the total lipid content, was determined by a phosphorus assay [73]. Stock solutions of p1, p1-Cu2+, p3, and p3-Cu2+ (150 \u03bcM) were serially diluted to be at 10X of the concentration needed to reach the following peptide-to-lipid ratios P1 (P1-Cu2+)/L = 1:512, 1:256, 1:128, 1:64, 1:32, 1;16, 1:8, and 1:4 and P3/L (P3-Cu2+) = 1:256, 1:128, 1:64, 1:32, 1;16, 1:8, 1:4, and 1:2. Each well containing 180 \u03bcL of LUVs was exposed to 20 \u03bcL of a peptide solution prepared at a given peptide-to-lipid ratio. Each concentration was run in triplicates. After 1 h incubation at either 37\u00b0C or 45\u00b0C, with shaking conditions of 140 rpm, the fluorescence of the calcein dye was measured in a BioTek H4 Synergy Hybrid Microplate Reader using excitation and emission wavelengths of 490nm and 520nm. The obtained fluorescence readings were normalized using the following equation:\n%FractionCalceinLeakage=I\u2212IbackgroundITriton\u2212Ibackground\u00d7100(1)\nwhere I is the fluorescence intensity measured after exposure to the peptide, Ibackground is the fluorescence measured for the negative control (LUVs alone), and ITriton is the fluorescence intensity measured for the positive control (LUVs with 20\u03bcL of 1% v/v of the detergent Triton X-100).\nThe normalized data was fitted using GraphPad Prism to determine the half-maximal effective concentration for each of the peptides as an EC50 value against the P/L ratio. The EC50 represents the amount of peptide needed to lyse 50% of the vesicles [74].\n\n## Electron microscopy\nOvernight cultures were prepared by inoculating individual colonies into 3 mL BHIS broth and grown for 14\u201316 h at 37\u00b0C in the anaerobic chamber. The overnight cultures were diluted 1:20 into 4 mL BHIS broth and the cultures were grown until they reached exponential phase (OD600 0.4\u20130.6). Inside the chamber, 1 mL of the exponential phase cultures were treated in test tubes for 5 minutes with: 1) no treatment, 2) 0.5 \u03bcg/mL vancomycin, 3) 4 \u03bcM p1-Cu2+, or 4) 4 \u03bcM p1-Cu2+ and 0.5 \u03bcg/mL vancomycin. After treatment, the samples were transferred to 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 2 minutes to collect the pellets. The pellets were individually suspended in 1 mL of 1X phosphate-buffered saline solution with 4% paraformaldehyde, prepared as described in [75]. The samples were fixed in the anaerobic chamber for 45 min. After fixation, the eppendorf tubes were removed from the chamber and the exteriors were sterilized with SporGon (Thomas Scientific), 10% bleach, and 70% ethanol (VWR). Samples were incubated on 200 mesh formvar-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) that were glow-discharged. Grids were washed with water, incubated with 2% uranyl acetate, washed with water, dried overnight at room temperature, and imaged using a JEM-2100F TEM (JEOL, Akishima, Japan) at a voltage of 200 kV and using a Gatan OneView camera. The percentage of lysed cells in each condition and the standard error of each condition were compared using the Wilson confidence interval.\n\n## Piscidins synergize with multiple classes of antibiotics\nWe have previously reported that both p1 and p3 are bactericidal against C. difficile at 4 \u03bcM and 8 \u03bcM concentrations, respectively [53]. As HDPs have previously been reported to potentiate ineffective antibiotics against C. difficile, we hypothesized that they could increase the efficacy of metronidazole, vancomycin, and fidaxomicin [44]. These antibiotics target different cellular components, providing us with a way to identify whether increased efficacy relies on specific mechanistic aspects of the antibiotics and peptides. We tested this by inoculating C. difficile R20291 into media containing metronidazole, fidaxomicin, and vancomycin in the presence or absence of piscidins at half of the peptide concentration required to inhibit C. difficile growth overnight [53].\nWe first tested the peptides on vancomycin, which targets the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria, for the ability of vancomycin to reduce overnight growth by at least 90%. We have previously reported that vancomycin inhibits the growth of C. difficile R20291 at concentrations at or above 4 \u03bcg/mL (Table 1) [76]. Using 2 \u03bcM p1 improved vancomycin efficacy by a factor of two, reducing its effective concentration from the previously observed 4 \u03bcg/mL to 2 \u03bcg/mL (Fig 1A and Table 1) [76]. In the case of 2 \u03bcM p1-Cu2+, the improvement with the peptide was 64-fold, with an effective vancomycin concentration of 0.0625 \u03bcg/mL. We note some breakthrough growth in the combinatorial condition containing 0.25 \u03bcg/mL vancomycin and 2 \u03bcM p1-Cu2+. This is due to a single sample out of the set, suggesting contamination or an inoculation error (Fig 1A and Table 1). With 4 \u03bcM p3 and p3-Cu2+, the effective vancomycin concentrations are decreased 8- and 16-fold to 0.5 and 0.25 \u03bcg/mL, respectively (Fig 1B and Table 1). The combination of 2 \u03bcM p1 and 4 \u03bcM p3 improved the effective vancomycin concentration by a factor of 32 to 0.125 \u03bcg/mL (Fig 1A and 1B and Table 1). Overall, all of the peptides tested improved the activity of vancomycin, with p1-Cu2+, the more membrane active peptide, most effective at boosting this antibiotic that acts on cell walls.\nNext, we tested antibiotics that have intracellular targets. We started with metronidazole, which targets protein synthesis by binding to DNA [10\u201312]. We found that 2 \u03bcM p1 improved efficacy of metronidazole four-fold, from 2 \u03bcg/mL down to 0.5 \u03bcg/mL (Fig 2A and Table 1) [10]. Metalation of the peptide did not appear to boost the peptide activity since the effective metronidazole concentration improved only two-fold, decreasing the concentration to 1 \u03bcg/mL (Fig 2A and Table 1). Remarkably, 4 \u03bcM p3, which condenses DNA very effectively [77], improved the metronidazole efficacy 32-fold with an effective concentration of 0.0625 \u03bcg/mL, while p3-Cu2+ only reduced the effective concentration two-fold, down to 1 \u03bcg/mL (Fig 2B and Table 1). The combination of 2 \u03bcM p1 with 4 \u03bcM p3 enhanced metronidazole activity 16-fold, decreasing the effective concentration to 0.125 \u03bcg/mL. Hence, it was more effective than apo-p1 or either metallated peptide but less effective than p3 (Fig 2A and 2B and Table 1). Overall, all of the peptides improved the efficacy of metronidazole by a factor of at least 2 (Fig 2A and 2B). Importantly, p3 was the most adjuvant to metronidazole with a 32-fold improvement, correlating with the ability of both antimicrobials to target DNA.\nWe also tested fidaxomicin, an antibiotic which inhibits RNA polymerase at the time of transcription initiation; it thus has an intracellular target but does not bind to DNA. It is effective against C. difficile at much lower concentrations than metronidazole or vancomycin. The concentration necessary to suppress C. difficile growth, previously observed to be 0.256 \u03bcg/mL, was reduced 5-fold to 0.05 \u03bcg/mL by the presence of 2 \u03bcM p1 (Fig 3A and Table 1) [76]. The use of 2 \u03bcM p1-Cu2+ was even more effective, lowering the observed effective concentration 20-fold, to 0.0125 \u03bcg/mL (Fig 3A and Table 1). Using 4 \u03bcM p3 resulted in the same efficacy as 2 \u03bcM p1. However, even 0.1 \u03bcg/mL fidaxomicin, the highest concentration tested, did not inhibit growth below the 90% threshold in the presence of 4 \u03bcM p3-Cu2+ (Fig 3B and Table 1). While p3-Cu2+ did appear to enhance fidaxomicin efficacy at lower concentrations, it was less effective than the apo-state, thus the presence of copper ions did not appeared to boost the adjuvant activity of p3 against this antibiotic. Here, the mixture of 2 \u03bcM p1 and 4 \u03bcM p3 did display a significant adjuvant effect with the antibiotic, sensitizing C. difficile 40-fold, down to 0.00625 \u03bcg/mL, an enhancement far greater than that achieved by either peptide alone (Fig 3A and 3B and Table 1).\nWe repeated these assays with ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that targets topoisomerases to which C. difficile is highly resistant with a recorded MIC > 128 \u03bcg/mL. p1 alone had no discernible effect on clostridial growth in ciprofloxacin, while growth was suppressed 37% and 34% by 4 and 16 \u03bcg/ml antibiotic in the presence of the p1-Cu2+ complex (Fig 4A and Table 1). Interestingly, in all concentrations of ciprofloxacin tested, growth was suppressed 27%-67% by both the apo and holo forms of p3, and the presence copper had no apparent effect on this interaction. (Fig 4B and Table 1) The combination of p1 and p3 did appear to enable ciprofloxacin to suppress clostridial growth at 2, 8, and 32 \u03bcg/mL concentrations, with breakthrough growth observed at 4 and 16 \u03bcg/mL ciprofloxacin (Fig 4B).\n\n## Piscidins activate antibiotics to enhance vegetative cell killing but do not affect dormant \nTo confirm that the combined piscidin-antibiotic treatments had killed the bacteria in the samples rather than temporarily suppressing their growth, the overnight exposures were repeated. After overnight incubation in conditions that contained the sub-lethal concentrations of piscidins i.e. 2 \u03bcM p1 (or p1-Cu2+) or 4 \u03bcM p3 (or p3-Cu2+) combined with antibiotic concentrations which inhibited overnight growth, samples were spread on BHIS plates and visible colonies were enumerated. While the number of culturable vegetative cells in the untreated controls was not very high after overnight growth, co-treatment with piscidins and sub-lethal concentrations of metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin further reduced the number of viable cells in the samples (Fig 5A). Piscidins together with 8 \u03bcg/mL ciprofloxacin reduced the number of colonies roughly 2-fold, commensurate with the modest reduction seen in optical densities after ciprofloxacin treatment (Fig 5A). While liquid BHIS is not a growth medium that yields high numbers of spores, overnight incubation does result in the recovery of heat- and ethanol-resistant C. difficile spores [78]. Previously, cationic HDPs were not found to affect dormant spores of Bacillus subtilis due to lack of access to the plasma membrane [79,80]. Similarly, we found that p1 and p3, when present at or above the concentrations necessary to kill vegetative C. difficile, do not affect the viability of dormant C. difficile spores (Fig 5B).\n\n## Piscidins increase ability of exogenous substances to penetrate \nWe have previously shown uptake of fluorescently labeled piscidins by live C. difficile cells, which appear to accumulate the labeled peptides at cell poles and division septa where the membranes exhibit curvature [53]. Here, we have assessed the ability of non-labeled piscidins to increase uptake of exogenous substances across the bacterial cell membrane. We treated live, exponentially growing C. difficile cells with sublethal peptide concentrations and the fluorophore propidium iodide (PI), which is not permeable across intact cell membranes and typically only stains dead or membrane-compromised cells [80]. Samples containing apo peptide were incubated for 30 minutes before unincorporated dye was washed away and samples were placed in sealed rose chambers for live cell microscopy [53,81]. Samples containing metalated peptides were incubated for 10 minutes, as the peptide-copper complexes began to stimulate visible cell lysis within 30 minutes of exposure. PI uptake was extremely low in live C. difficile in anaerobic conditions (Fig 6A) and was much greater in cells exposed to cytotoxic levels of oxygen and ethanol (Fig 6B). The apo forms of p1 and p3 did not visibly increase PI uptake (Fig 6C and 6E), but the metalated forms of both peptides did increase the number of red (dead) cells present in the fields of view examines (Fig 6D and 6F). The combination of sublethal levels of p1 and p3 also visibly increased PI uptake, resulting in red fluorescent cells (Fig 6G). While qualitative, these results illustrate increased penetration of exogenous membrane-impermeable substances in the presence of piscidins.\n\n## Piscidins permeabilize \nTo qualitatively assess the activity of the piscidin peptides at C. difficile membranes, we quantified their ability to release calcein entrapped in vesicles constituted of lipid mimicking the bilayer of the pathogen. We used lipids representative of unique membrane composition of C. difficile [82\u201384]. Importantly, C. difficile lacks phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a phospholipid commonly present in bacterial membranes, but contains glycolipids [82,83]. Here, we used a mixture of POPG and DG-glucose to model the membrane of C. difficile. The POPG component mimics the high anionic content of its membrane while DG-glucose recapitulates the presence of zwitterionic glycolipids [82]. Normalized fluorescence intensity measurements were plotted against the peptide-to lipid ratios and their sigmoidal shape is indicative of a cooperative mechanism of action (Fig 7) [85]. This is consistent with leakage assays previously reported involving these peptides in other lipid systems [42]. The EC50 values are shown in Table 2, where higher EC50 value correspond to enhanced membrane activity of the peptides. In the case of both p1 and p3, the holo states achieved higher permeability compared to the apo forms by a factor of \u223c2\u20133, consistent with previous reports (Fig 7) [57,58,62]. p1-Cu2+ exhibited the highest activity with an EC50 of 1:52 while this value was 1:20 for P3-Cu2+. We previously demonstrated that the stronger membrane activity of p1 compared to p3 correlates with its enhanced ability to be retained by the bilayer, and thus can form longer-lived defects [57]. The metalated state of each peptide is more active than its apo-form due to enhanced depth of insertion. To the best of our knowledge, the phase transition temperature (Tm) of DG-glucose and similar glycolipids has not been reported but glycolipids tend to increase Tm due to changes in packing of molecules in the membrane [86]. Since the melting point could be in the range of 37\u00b0C [86], we tested the higher temperature of 45\u00b0C. However, similar EC50 values were obtained at both temperatures. Together with the fact that the EC50 obtained are similar to those reported previously for p1 and p3 with plain phospholipids used above their Tm [57,67,77,87], we conclude that the phase transition was already reached at 37\u00b0C.\nTo directly visualize the effects of piscidin treatment, antibiotic stress, and piscidin-antibiotic co-treatment on the C. difficile cell envelo",
