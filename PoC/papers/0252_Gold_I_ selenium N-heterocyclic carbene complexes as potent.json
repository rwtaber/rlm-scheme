  "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria have become a global threat to human life and health, and novel antibiotics are urgently needed. The thioredoxin (Trx) system can be used as an antibacterial target to combat MDR bacteria. Here, we found that two active gold(I) selenium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes H7 and H8 show more promising antibacterial effects against MDR bacteria than auranofin. Both H7 and H8 irreversibly inhibit the bacterial TrxR activity via targeting the redox-active motif, abolishing the capacity of TrxR to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS) and finally leading to oxidative stress. The increased cellular superoxide radical levels impact a variety of functions necessary for bacterial survival, such as cellular redox balance, cell membrane integrity, amino acid metabolism, and lipid peroxidation. In vivo data present much better antibacterial activity of H7 and H8 than auranofin, promoting the wound healing and prolonging the survival time of Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) induced peritonitis. Most notably in this study, we revealed the influence of gold(I) complexes on both the Trx system and the cellular metabolic states to better understand their killing mechanism and to support further antibacterial drug design.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nAntimicrobial resistance is escalating into a profound threat to global public health due to the lack of effective and safe alternative treatments [1]. Carbapenem antibiotics are the last line in defending MDR Gram-negative bacteria infections in the clinical with few other therapeutic options [2]. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has developed resistance to most antibiotics and is associated with high mortality. A study reported in-hospital mortality in 43 (35%) of 123 patients with bloodstream infection of CRE [3,4]. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA), carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP), and carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CREco) were placed on the \u2018Threat List\u2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO), among which CRAB was listed in the first priority tier, urgently in need of screening and designing novel antibiotics [5]. Hence, it is critical to discover and develop alternative antimicrobial strategies.\nSearching for antimicrobial targets that are distict from conventional antibiotics should be undertaken to reduce the rates of antibacterial resistance [6]. Thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH) systems provide antioxidant capacity for Gram-negative bacteria, which play critical roles in maintaining the cellular redox environment [7]. The Trx system contains NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and Trx, which are essential for survival under oxidative stress in some pathogenic bacteria lacking the GSH-Grx system [8,9]. In Gram-negative bacteria, the Trx system not only serves as an antioxidant system but also plays critical roles in DNA replication, redox signaling and cellular protein disulfide/dithiol redox control [8,10]. Thus, the Trx system can be regarded as an important antibacterial target to combat MDR bacteria.\nIn recent years, gold complexes have attracted attention as promising anticancer agents [11,12], and these complexes exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against MDR bacteria and fungus [13,14]. Auranofin (AF), a FDA-approved oral gold-containing complex, has a well-studied safety profile with rare, mild, and self-limiting adverse effects. AF has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and undergoing Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of amoebic dysentery, giardiasis and tuberculosis. Previous studies showed AF as a potential antimicrobial agent is involving in the inhibition of TrxR, most likely through displacement of two ligands from gold by forming a tight complex between the metal and the active site cysteines of TrxR [15]. Recently, auranofin was identified as an inhibitor of metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBLs) and mobilized colistin resistance, and it resensitized carbapenem- and colistin-resistant bacteria to antibiotics by displacing Zn(II) cofactors from the active site of enzymes involved in antibiotic resistance [16]. Thus, the repurposing of auranofin is a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome drug-resistant bacteria.\nRecent studies showed that auranofin has a strong antibacterial effect on Gram-positive bacteria, while it has a weak antibacterial effect on Gram-negative bacteria [15,17]. The weak antibacterial effect of auranofin toward Gram-negative bacteria was suggested to be the result of their glutathione system, glutathione/glutathione reductase, being able to compensate for the loss of reducing capability in the Trx-TrxR system caused by auranofin [18]. Due to the specific metabolism pathway of Gram-negative bacteria, auranofin exhibits relative weak anti-bacteria effects. High dosage of auranofin against Gram-negative bacteria may no longer be adequate. Furthermore, the Au\u2013S bond structure of auranofin is easily attacked by thiols present in the blood and cell membrane, which leads to toxicity and side effects [19]. Therefore, the structural modification of auranofin, which can stabilize gold complexes, has become extremely important.\nSelenium (Se), as an analogue of sulfur, has higher reactivity due to the lower pK\u03b1 of selenols than thiols. Meanwhile, Se compounds have attracted a lot of interests recently as promising chemopreventive agents [20]. In addition, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are a class of ligands whose donor properties form strong coordinate covalent bonds through \u03c3 donor properties and \u03c0-back-donation to form stable structures [21,22]. Therefore, these ligands play an important role in determining the stability and activity of gold complexes. Based on these results, we substituted the sulfur ligands in the auranofin structure with Se NHC compounds and developed stabilized gold complexes as TrxR inhibitors for MDR bacteria. According to our previous studies on NHC rhodium and gold complexes derived from 4,5-diarylimidazoles, aryl para-substituents and N side-chain substituents have certain regularity on the activity of metal complexes [23,24]. What's more, it is well known that phosphine ligands are very important and influential in terms of selectivity for gold complexes. The introduction of Triphenylphosphine (PPh3) and Triethylphosphine (PEt3) may enhance the lipophilicity and activity of gold complexes [25]. Encouragingly, these complexes show higher antibacterial activity and lower toxicity than auranofin in vitro and in vivo.\n\n## Bacterial strains and culture conditions\nAuranofin (Yuanye, Shanghai, China) and other gold complexes were dissolved in DMF (Sigma Aldrich, USA). All antibiotics (Yuanye, Shanghai, China) were prepared in sterilized Milli-Q water (Millipore, USA). The CRAB strain was isolated from hospital (High-throughput DNA sequencing results are seen in Fig. S5, Tables S1 and S2). The carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (BAA-1705), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (BAA-2108), carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (BAA-2140), vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 700699), were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, USA). All the strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth containing 10\u00a0g/L tryptone (Aobox, Beijing, China), 5\u00a0g/L yeast extract (AOBOX, Beijing, China) and 10\u00a0g/L NaCl (Solarbio, Beijing, China).\n\n## Chemicals\nGeneral synthesis of gold complexes H1\u2013H17 is presented in Fig. 1 and in detail in the Supplementary Material.Fig. 1The synthetic route and chemical structures of H1\u2013H17: i: Se, KOtBu, THF, 0\u00a0\u00b0C, 5\u00a0h; ii: Et3PAuCl/Ph3PAuCl, DCM, Ar, rt, darkness, 20\u00a0min.Fig. 1\n\n## Stability analysis of \nComplex H7, H8 was accurately weighed and dissolved in DMF to prepare 20\u00a0mM solution, and then diluted to 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM solution with PBS (10\u00a0mM, pH\u00a0=\u00a07.2). A UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer was used to scan the full UV wavelength of diluent for 0\u00a0h, 6\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, 72\u00a0h, 120\u00a0h and 168\u00a0h successively, and observe the UV absorption changes at 298\u00a0K over 7 days.\n\n## Solubility of compounds\nMeasure the maximum absorption wavelength of H7 in PBS: DMF\u00a0=\u00a0500: 1 with a UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer at 298\u00a0K. To obtain a stock solution, H7 was weighed and dissolved in DMF, then add 500 times (v/v) PBS and mixi well. The stock solution was then diluted with PBS: DMF\u00a0=\u00a0500: 1, made into solutions of various concentrations, and their UV absorbance values at 236\u00a0nm were measured sequentially, followed by the drawn of a standard curve (Fig. S14). In the same approach, a saturated solution of H7 was made, the upper clear solution was taken after centrifugation and diluted four times. Then the absorbance at 236\u00a0nm was measured to calculate the solubility of H7.\n\n## Genome sequencing of CRAB\nGenomic DNA was extracted with the SDS method. The harvested DNA was detected by the agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).\nA total amount of 1\u00a0\u03bcg DNA per sample was used as input material for the DNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext\u00ae Ultra\u2122 DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) following manufacturer's recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly, the DNA sample was fragmented by sonication to a size of 350 bp, then DNA fragments were end-polished, a tailed, and ligated with the full-length adaptor for Illumina sequencing with further PCR amplification. At last, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and libraries were analyzed for size distribution by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using real-time PCR.\nThe whole genome of CRAB was sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq PE150 at the Beijing Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd.\n\n## Screening of antibacterial activity of gold complexes and ligands\nAntibacterial effect of gold complexes (H1\u2013H17) and the synthesized ligands (S1\u2013S9) were determined by microbroth dilution method referring to CLSI guidelines as described previously [26]. 96-well plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in the incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and measured manually following 24\u00a0h of incubation by microplate reader (PerkinElmer, USA).\n\n## Cytotoxicity assays\nCell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8) allows convenient assays using WST-8[2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt], which produces a water-soluble formazan dye upon reduction in the presence of an electron carrier, 1-Methoxy PMS. CCK-8, being nonradioactive, allows sensitive colorimetric assays for the determination of the number of viable cells in cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assays. The cell survival rate of target gold complexes were determined by the CCK-8 assay kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China) as described previously [27]. Briefly, before being treated, cells (Vero and LO2) were seeded in 96-well plates for 24\u00a0h, and cells were exposed to gold complexes at different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 5, 10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 72\u00a0h. Then, supernatant was removed from the 96-well plates and CCK-8 solution was added into each well. The cytotoxicity of was measured at OD570nm after being incubated for 4\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n## Screening of synergistic effect of antibiotic with gold complexes\nScreening of synergistic effect of antibiotic with gold complexes (H7, H8 and auranofin) by using checkerboard microdilution assay as previous described [16]. Briefly, the bacterial suspension was diluted according to CLSI microbroth dilution method, and seeded in each well of 96-well plate. Then, the bacterial suspension was exposed to the treatment of gold complexes at different concentrations (0\u201320\u00a0\u03bcM) in the presence of different antibiotic concentrations (0\u2013240\u00a0\u03bcM). The inhibition rate was measured by microplate reader at OD600nm.\n\n## Intracellular gold uptake\nBacteria culture was diluted to OD600nm of 0.4\u20130.6, and treated with H7, H8 or auranofin (20\u00a0\u03bcM) for 2\u00a0h. Cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and normalized to OD600nm of 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02. Then, 1\u00a0mL bacterial culture of each sample was collected for further measurement. Cell pellets were collected after centrifugation and digested with HCl (0.5\u00a0mL), followed by the addition of 4.5\u00a0mL of ddH2O2 and the final gold content was determined by Thermo X series 2 ICP-MS (Thermo, USA).\n\n## Cellular activities of TrxR assay\nTrxR catalyzes NADPH to reduce 5,5\u2032-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to form TNB and NADP+, TNB has a absorbance at 412\u00a0nm, but reduced glutathione reacts with DTNB to form TNB, so the 2-Vinylpyridine in this kit can inhibit reduced glutathione in sample, the activity of TrxR can be calculated by detecting the increase rate of TNB at 412\u00a0nm. The activity of cellular TrxR was determined according to the TrxR activity detection kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Briefly, bacteria culture was diluted to OD600nm of 0.4\u20130.6, and treated with different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20\u00a0\u03bcM) of gold complexes (H7, H8, auranofin) for 2\u00a0h. The cell pellets were harvested and washed with PBS for three times. Bacterial cells were normalized to OD600nm of 0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02. The cellular TrxR was measured by the microplate reader followed the protocol of TrxR Assay Kit.\n\n## Inhibition of purified selenoprotein TrxR\nInhibition to the activity of purified TrxR (purified rat liver TrxR was purchased from Sigma Aldrich) by H7 and H8 were determined according to previously method [28].\n\n## Expression of \nDNA sequence (957 bp) containing TrxR (encoded by trxB, 315 aa) from CRAB was synthesized by Sangon Biotech. Co. (Shanghai, China) and then constructed into a pET-28a vector with an N-terminal 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0His tag by subcloning a Nco I/BamH I fragment. Recombinant CRAB TrxR with an N-terminal 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0His tag was produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). In brief, E. coli BL21\u00a0cells were transformed with the plasmid containing CRAB TrxR gene and a single colony was grown in LB medium at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with 200\u00a0rpm overnight. Next day, the cultured cells were inoculated into fresh medium and cultured for 1.5\u20132.0\u00a0h (OD600nm\u00a0=\u00a00.5). Then, 0.5\u00a0mM IPTG was added in the medium and the induced expression was performed at 24\u00a0\u00b0C with 200\u00a0rpm for additional 24\u00a0h. Bacterial cells were centrifuged and wet pellets were harvested, and used for further separation and purification.\n\n## Purification of recombinant \nThe harvested bacterial pellets were suspended in a binding buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris, 150\u00a0mM NaCl and 20\u00a0mM imidazole) and lysed by freeze-thawing three times with 1\u00a0mg/mL lysozyme and ultrasonicator in ice. After centrifugation at 18,000\u00a0rpm for 30\u00a0min, the supernatant fraction was subject to a prepacked nickel column (Histrap FF crude, Cytiva, USA) and then loaded to a gel filtration column (HiPrep Sepharcryl S-200, Cytiva, USA) after being concentrated by a 30\u00a0kDa cut-off ultrafiltration device (50\u00a0mL spin column, Millipore, USA) (Fig. S11). The protein concentration of CRAB TrxR was determined by measuring FAD absorbance at 463\u00a0nm with the extinction coefficient of 11,300\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0cm\u22121 as previously described [29,30].\n\n## Enzymatic activity of CRAB TrxR\nActivity of CRAB TrxR was determined by using a standard DTNB-reducing activity assay as described in previous reports [31,32]. The working reaction mixture contains 100\u00a0nM CRAB TrxR (dimeric form), 2.5\u00a0mM DTNB, 300\u00a0\u03bcM NADPH in a TE buffer (pH 7.5). TrxR-mediated DTNB reduction was evaluated by the formation of TNB\u2212 following the initial slope @ A412 nm for 3\u00a0min, with the extinction coefficient of 13,600\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0cm\u22121. The kinetic parameters were determined using a varied DTNB concentrations in range from 0 to 5\u00a0mM and fitted into Michaelis-Menten equation by Prism 8.0 (GraphPad, USA).\n\n## Inhibition of CRAB TrxR by gold complexes\n2 \u03bcM CRAB TrxR was pre-reduced by 100\u00a0\u03bcM NADPH for 10\u00a0min at room temperature (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C) to reduce the redox-active disulfide bond. NADPH-reduced TrxR was then treated with auranofin, H7 and H8 as indicated. The residual TrxR activity was determined by DTNB reducing assay.\n\n## Quantitative real-Time PCR\nThe IC50 value concentrations of gold complexes (H7, H8) were established with the initial OD600nm of 0.4\u20130.5 and shaken for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Total RNA were extracted from the bacterial cells according to the Total RNA Extraction Kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China) protocol. Briefly, adding 1\u00a0mL lysis buffer to lyse cells directly, after incubate homogenized samples at room temperature for 5\u00a0min, per 1\u00a0mL lysis buffer was added 200\u00a0\u03bcL of chloroform for homogenization. Then centrifuge the sample, pipette the aqueous phase out into a new tube. Preparation RNase free collection column, and add 200\u00a0\u03bcL ethanol in the aqueous phase and vortex, transfer the aqueous phase in the collection column. Then add the washing buffer in collection column tube twice to wash the column, and place the RNase-free spin column in a new 1.5\u00a0mL collection tube to elute the RNA. The quality of RNA was detected by electrophoresis. Hifair \u00ae\u2161 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) was applied to reverse transcription. The cDNA was then used in the real-time qPCR experiment using the SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Bimake, Houston, USA) with the QuantStudio\u2122 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). All assays were performed in triplicate. 16s was used as an internal control gene. Relative expression was calculated by using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. The following primers for qPCR were used:\n16s (forward): 5\u2032-CAGC-TCGT-GTCG-TGAG-ATGT-3\u2032\n16s (reverse): 5\u2032-CGTA-AGGG-CCAT-GATG-ACTT-3\u2032\nTrxB (forward): 5\u2032-ACGA-AAGA-TGAC-AGCA-AACA-AG-3\u2032\nTrxB (reverse): 5\u2032-AGCC-ATAC-AGCC-TGAA-CCC-3\u2032\n\n## Measurement of intracellular superoxide radical\nDihydroethidium (DHE) probe is one of the most used fluorescent probes for detecting superoxide radical, which can be oxidized to form ethyl oxide by intracellular ROS, producing red fluorescence through incorporation into chromosomal DNA. The intensity of red fluorescence is proportional to the level of ROS in cells. Bacteria culture was diluted to OD600nm of 0.4\u20130.5 and incubated with DHE probe at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and shaken for 20\u00a0min. Then, the cell culture was incubated with gold complexes (auranofin, H7 and H8) of different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80\u00a0\u03bcM) for 30\u00a0min, respectively. Cells were collected and washed twice with PBS, and each sample was then resuspended in 1\u00a0mL PBS for measurement. All the data was collected using BD Accuri\u2122 C6 Plus flow cytometry with a 480\u2013535\u00a0nm argon laser and a 590\u2013610\u00a0nm emission filter at low flow rate. At least 100,000\u00a0cells were collected for each sample. FlowJo V10 was used for processing flow cytometric data.\n\n## Membrane permeabilization assay\nPropidium iodide (PI) uptake assay was used to determine the membrane permeability of auranofin, H7 and H8 by cytometry method as previously described. In brief, bacteria culture was diluted to OD600nm of 0.4\u20130.5 and incubated with PI (50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) shaken for 20\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Then, the cell culture was incubated with gold complexes (auranofin, H7 and H8) at different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80\u00a0\u03bcM) for 30\u00a0min, respectively. Cells were collected and washed twice with PBS, and each sample was then resuspended in 1\u00a0mL PBS for measurement. All the data were collected using BD Accuri\u2122 C6 Plus flow cytometry with a 480\u2013535\u00a0nm argon laser and a 590\u2013610\u00a0nm emission filter at low flow rate. At least 100,000\u00a0cells were collected for each sample. FlowJo V10 was used for processing flow cytometric data.\n\n## Preparation of intracellular metabolites extracts\nPreparation of cellular metabolite extracts was carried out as previously described [33]. In brief, bacterial pellets were collected after being treated with H7, H8 (20\u00a0\u03bcM) at 2\u00a0h and resuspended in 600\u00a0\u03bcL methanol: water mixture (9: 1, v/v) at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C, containing 1,2\u201313C myristic acid (internal standard). Three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen were used for lysing cells and releasing cellular metabolites, which followed by ultrasonic cell crusher (Scientz, Ningbo, China) to disrupt each sample for 10\u00a0min. Then, all the samples were centrifuged at 8000\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. 450\u00a0\u03bcL of supernatant was collected for derivatization and metabolomics analysis described previously [34].\n\n## Measurement of cellular GSH\nThe reduced form of glutathione (GSH) is a natural tripeptide composed of glutamic acid (Glu), cysteine (Cys) and glycine (Gly). Glutathione can react with DTNB to produce 2-nitro-5-mercaptobenzoic acid and glutathione disulphide (GSSG). 2-nitro-5-mercaptobenzoic acid is a yellow product with the maximum absorption at 412\u00a0nm. Bacteria were treated with H7 (0, 10, 20, 40\u00a0\u03bcM) and H8 (0, 10, 20, 40\u00a0\u03bcM), respectively and then continued to culture at 200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 4000\u00a0g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C to harvest bacterial cells, cell pellets were washed for three times with PBS. Bacterial cells were normalized to OD600nm\u00a0=\u00a00.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 and subsequently disrupted using ultrasonic cell crusher for 10\u00a0min to lyse cells. After centrifugation at 8000\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, the supernatant was collected for cellular GSH measurement. The cellular GSH level was measured by the Reduced Glutathione Content Assay Kit (Solarbio, Shanghai, China), using the microplate reader (PerkinElmer, USA).\n\n## Determination of intracellular K\nBacteria were treated separately with H7 (0, 10, 20, 40\u00a0\u03bcM) and H8 (0, 10, 20, 40\u00a0\u03bcM), and shaken at 200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 4000\u00a0g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, cell pellets were washed for three times with PBS. Bacterial cells were normalized to OD600nm\u00a0=\u00a00.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, and then the internal K+, Mg2+, malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined according to the protocols of K+, Mg2+, MDA and SOD activity assay kits (Jiancheng, Nanjing, China).\n\n## Determination of DNA degradation\nGenomic DNA from CRAB was collected by using the MiniBEST Bacteria Genomic DNA Extraction Kit ver.3.0 (TaKaRa, Japan). The DNA was then treated with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 40\u00a0\u03bcM) of H7 and H8 for 2\u00a0h, respectively. Finally, DNA degradation was determined by using the agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide (EB) staining and documented by using Gel imaging system (Tanon, China).\n\n## Animal approvement\nAll BALB/c mice (No.SYXK-2018-0049) were domesticated under standard laboratory conditions and were given free access to standard water and food. All procedures were approved by the Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine.\n\n## Murine skin wound infection model\nTwenty male BALB/c (18\u201322\u00a0g) mice were randomly divided into 7 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a04), and 200\u00a0\u03bcL 1 \u00d7 109 CFU of CRAB was inoculated on the back skin wounds of mice. The mice were then treated with 30\u00a0\u03bcL 0.9% NaCl, H2O2 (5\u00a0mM), auranofin (5\u00a0mM), imipenem (5\u00a0mM), colistin (5\u00a0mM), H7 (5\u00a0mM) or H8 (5\u00a0mM) once per day for 14 days, respectively. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, the skin of the wound was excised for inflammatory cytokines, pathological and IHC detection. The wound healing was calculated by formula as follows: F= (A-B)/A\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100%, where F: wound healing rate, A: original wound area, and B: wound area post-treatment. This animal experiment was repeated three times.\n\n## Murine peritonitis infection model\nThirty-two male BALB/c (18\u201322\u00a0g) mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a08), and forty-eight female BALB/c (18\u201322\u00a0g) mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a012). Then, the BALB/c mice were infected i.p. with 200\u00a0\u03bcL 109\u00a0CFU of CRAB. After 1h infection, the mice in the four groups were i.p. injected with PBS, auranofin (5\u00a0mg/kg), H7 (5\u00a0mg/kg) and H8 (5\u00a0mg/kg) respectively. The survival rate within 72\u00a0h was observed. This animal experiment was repeated three times.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nGraphPad Prism 7.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Student's t-test was performed for determination of differences between groups and statistical significance was considered at value of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.\n\n## Synthesis and characterization of gold complexes\nThe synthetic routes of gold(I) selenium NHC complexes H1\u2013H17 are outlined in Fig. 1. The diarylimidazolium salts L1-L9 and Se\u2013NHC compounds (S1\u2013S9) were prepared according to our previously published methods [35]. Initially, the ligands (L1-L9), Se powder and potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) in an ice bath to obtain Se\u2013NHC compounds (S1\u2013S9). Then, Se\u2013NHC compounds (S1\u2013S9) and gold complexes chloro (triphenylphosphine) gold(I) or chloro (triethylphosphine) gold(I) were stirred at room temperature for 20\u00a0min in the dark under the protection of argon to obtain complexes H1\u2013H17 (Fig. 1). The gold complexes were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS spectra. Except for the newly generated peaks of PPh3 and PEt3 in H1\u2013H17, there is no obvious change in the chemical shift of the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra between the selenium compounds S1\u2013S9 and gold complexes H1\u2013H17, which might be due to the weak coordination of the gold atom with selenium atom. From the ESI mass spectra, we can observe the peaks of [M\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Cl]+ for gold complexes H1\u2013H17. In addition, the purity of all complexes was higher than 95% (m/m) as determined by elemental analysis or HPLC. The stability of representative complexes H7 and H17 in water solution was tested over 7 days by examining the 1H NMR spectra of complexes H7 and H17 (Figs. S1 and S3). The 1H NMR spectra of complexes H7 and H17 did not change significantly within 7 days, indicating that complexes H7 and H17 were very stable in DMSO\u2011d6/D2O (9/1) solution. The stability of the main complexes H7 and H8 in PBS (10\u00a0mM, pH\u00a0=\u00a07.2), which is similar with in vitro/in vivo studies, was investigated using a UV spectrophotometer. As shown in Figs. S2 and S4, the UV absorption spectra of H7 and H8 did not change considerably during 7 days, demonstrating that complexes H7 and H8 were relatively stable in PBS.\n\n## Antibacterial activities of gold complexes and ligands\nWe firstly evaluated the antibacterial activity of synthesized ligands (L1-L9) and their gold(I) complexes (H1\u2013H17). The measurements were performed on MDR bacteria (CRAB, CRKP, CRPA and CREco) and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), among which CRAB was isolated from a hospital (the high-throughput DNA sequencing results are shown in Fig. S5 and Tables S1 and S2; NCBI accession code JAKLSN000000000). We also tested the antibiotic sensitivity of CRAB (Table S3) and results showed that the CRAB had developed resistance to most antibiotics. These strains were chosen because they represent pathogens urgently needing research and the development of novel antibiotics.\nThe MIC values of all complexes are shown in Table 1. Among the 17 complexes, H7 and H8 showed quite strong antibacterial activity against the MDR bacteria (MIC values of 10\u223c20\u00a0\u03bcM) and VISA (MIC values of 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM), which was generally better than the MIC values of auranofin. All of the other complexes showed no activity (CRKP, CRPA and CREco) up to 40\u00a0\u03bcM. The synthesized ligands (L1-L9) showed no activity (Table S4), which indicated that their antibacterial activities were primarily dependent on the presence of gold.Table 1The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of gold complexes against MDR bacteria.Table 1ComplexesCRABCRKPCRPACREcoVISA\u03bcM\u03bcg/mL\u03bcM\u03bcg/mL\u03bcM\u03bcg/mL\u03bcM\u03bcg/mL\u03bcM\u03bcg/mLH1108.71>40>34.84>40>34.84>40>34.840.20.17H2108.644034.56>40>34.56>40>34.5621.73H3107.424029.68>40>29.68>40>29.6821.48H4108.044032.16>40>32.16>40>32.1621.61H5107.724030.88>40>30.88>40>30.8821.54H6>40>36.72>40>36.72>40>36.72>40>36.72>40>36.72H7107.662015.322015.322015.320.20.15H8108.942017.882017.882017.880.20.19H92011.084022.16>40>22.16>40>22.1652.77H1040>40.56>40>40.56>40>40.56>40>40.5655.07H11>40>40.32>40>40.32>40>40.32>40>40.3255.04H12>40>35.44>40>35.44>40>35.44>40>35.4454.43H13>40>37.924037.924037.92>40>37.9210.95H14>40>36.64>40>36.64>40>36.64>40>36.644036.64H15>40>42.48>40>42.48>40>42.48>40>42.4855.31H162018.20>40>36.40>40>36.40>40>36.4054.55H17>40>41.52>40>41.45>40>41.45>40>41.451010.38Auranofin2013.564027.124027.124027.120.50.34\nAs the gold complexes displayed potential cytotoxicity, we next measured the cytotoxicity of the two gold(I) complexes (H7 and H8) in comparison to auranofin against two normal cell lines (Vero and LO2). The complexes H7 and H8 displayed a similar or even lower cytotoxicity in comparison to auranofin (Fig. S6). Additionally, to estimate the bioavailability of these complexes, we found that the solubility of H7 is about 310\u00a0\u03bcg/mL under conditions similar to the culture medium (PBS: DMF\u00a0=\u00a0500: 1, v/v) through experiment (Fig. S10). Therefore, H7 and H8 are better antibacterial agent choices than auranofin and deserved a further study.\nTo gain insights into the potential targets of H7 and H8, we used CRAB as a model for further investigation. First, we used a whole-cell uptake assay to measure the uptake of gold into the cell to investigate the relationship between the content of cellular gold and antibacterial efficacy. Whole-cell uptake was measured in \u223c100 million cells after 2\u00a0h of treatment with 20\u00a0\u03bcM gold complexes (auranofin, H7 and H8). The results showed that the uptake of H7 (45.11\u00a0ng/g protein) and H8 (53.42\u00a0ng/g protein) was higher than that of auranofin (16.64\u00a0ng/g protein) (Fig. 2). Then, we measured the gold uptake at 20, 40, 80, 100, 120\u00a0min of treatment with 20\u00a0\u03bcM gold complex (H8). The results showed that the intracellular gold content gradually increased from 20\u00a0min to longer time and reached the peak at 80\u00a0min (Fig. S7). The decrease of gold content after 80\u00a0min may be caused by cell membrane rupture leading to gold escape. This result provides a better correlation between gold cellular uptake and antibacterial activity.Fig. 2Whole-cell uptake of 20\u00a0\u03bcM gold complexes (auranofin, H7 and H8) by CRAB after 2-h treatment. Statistical significance of the differences in mean values are ****p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001.

Next, we screened the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics (such as \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin, cefotaxime, imipenem), quinolones (norfloxacin) and aminoglycosides (gentamicin) and the gold complexes (auranofin, H7 and H8). As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S8, the combination of auranofin with cefotaxime and imipenem led to additive killing of CRAB with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) ranging from 0.56 to 0.75. The MIC value of cefotaxime decreased from 240\u00a0\u03bcM to 30\u00a0\u03bcM in the presence of H7, H8 (2.5\u00a0\u03bcM), for which the FICI was estimated to be 0.375 (Table 2), i.e., indicative of synergy (FICI \u22640.5). The combination of H7 and H8 with imipenem showed synergistic killing of CRAB with an FICI of 0.5. Thus, our combined data clearly demonstrated that the combined effect of H7 and ",
