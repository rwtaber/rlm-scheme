  "full_text": "## Introduction\nThe spread of multidrug\u2010resistant (MDR) bacteria threatens modern medical treatment for infectious diseases (Walsh, 2003; Lewis, 2013). This is particularly true for MDR Gram\u2010negative bacteria, which account for up to 80% of severe bacterial infections in the clinic, with very few antibiotics that can currently combat them or that are being developed (Walsh, 2003; Lewis, 2013). Current antibiotics are mainly developed through the mechanisms of inhibition of bacterial cell wall, membrane, DNA, and protein synthesis (Walsh, 2003). Here we have explored a new antibiotic strategy based on inhibition of bacterial thiol\u2010dependent redox system.\nThere are two major thiol\u2010dependent enzyme systems in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells based on thioredoxin (Trx) and glutathione (GSH), which transfer electrons from NADPH to their substrates via thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) and glutathione reductases (GR) (Holmgren, 1989; Ritz & Beckwith, 2001; Lillig & Holmgren, 2007). These two systems are critical for DNA synthesis, defense against oxidative stress, repair of oxidized proteins, and post\u2010translational modifications such as protein S\u2010glutathionylation, or S\u2010nitrosylation, which are important for many cellular processes (Holmgren, 1989; Ritz & Beckwith, 2001; Lillig & Holmgren, 2007).\nBacterial thiol\u2010dependent redox systems have notable differences in components, enzyme structures, and reaction mechanisms compared with corresponding systems in the mammalian host (Holmgren, 1989; Nozawa et\u00a0al, 1989; Ritz & Beckwith, 2001; Lillig & Holmgren, 2007; Lu et\u00a0al, 2013a; Lu & Holmgren, 2014). For example, bacterial TrxR is an enzyme with a cysteine\u2010containing active site, while highly efficient mammalian TrxR is structurally different with a selenocysteine (Sec)\u2010containing active site. In addition to this property, the combination of highly antioxidant efficiency from glutathione peroxidases (GPx), peroxiredoxins (Prxs), and catalases (CAT) confer mammalian hosts an absolute advantage to maintain the reactive oxygen species (ROS) at a low level in comparison with bacteria (Morones\u2010Ramirez et\u00a0al, 2013a; Lu & Holmgren, 2014; Harbut et\u00a0al, 2015). Thus, all these differences guarantee bacterial redox systems are appropriate potential targets by specific antibiotics.\nTrx system is ubiquitous in bacteria, whereas GSH systems are lacking in some specific bacteria (Lu & Holmgren, 2014). Nearly all Gram\u2010negative bacteria contain GSH and glutaredoxin (Grx) (GSH\u2010positive bacteria), whereas most Gram\u2010positive bacteria lack GSH (GSH\u2010negative bacteria) (Martin, 1995; Wilkinson et\u00a0al, 2011; Lu & Holmgren, 2014). We previously reported that ebselen [2\u2010phenyl\u20101,2 benzisoselenazol\u20103(2H)\u2010one], a substrate of mammalian thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) but a competitive inhibitor of bacterial TrxR, displays selectively antibacterial activity toward GSH\u2010negative bacteria (Lu et\u00a0al, 2013a), with no inhibitory effect on GSH\u2010positive bacteria, for example, Escherichia coli (Nozawa et\u00a0al, 1989).\nHere we present a new antibiotic strategy selectively targeting bacterial thiol\u2010dependent redox systems via strong bactericidal effect of silver and ebselen in synergistic combination against GSH\u2010positive bacterial infections, particularly on MDR Gram\u2010negative bacteria. It has been reported that the antibacterial activity of silver might be associated with disruption of disulfide bond formation and enhanced production of ROS (Russell & Hugo, 1994; Kohanski et\u00a0al, 2007), but the exact mechanisms are still unclear. In this paper, we elucidated that silver ions were strong inhibitors of both E.\u00a0coli Trx and TrxR, and the combination with ebselen depleted GSH and gave a steep rise in ROS generation. Furthermore, we found that the presence of ebselen dramatically decreased the antibacterial concentration of silver, with highly significant selective toxicity on bacteria over mammalian cells. This selective toxicity should facilitate the systemic medical application of silver in the treatment of MDR Gram\u2010negative bacteria.\n\n## Combination of silver with ebselen exhibited selective synergistic toxicity against bacteria\nThe effect of silver nitrate with ebselen in combination on the growth of Gram\u2010negative model bacteria, E.\u00a0coli, was investigated in the microplates. DHB4 overnight cultures were diluted 1:1,000 times in Luria\u2010Bertani (LB) medium and treated with ionic silver (Ag+) as a nitrate salt (AgNO3) for 16\u00a0h. Ag+ alone inhibited E.\u00a0coli growth with a minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 42\u00a0\u03bcM after 16\u2010h treatment, while the addition of 2\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen dramatically decreased the MIC of Ag+ to 4.2\u00a0\u03bcM (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000028) (Fig\u00a01A). Meanwhile, 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen in combination showed no synergistic toxicity on human HeLa cells (P\u00a0=\u00a00.98) (Fig\u00a01B). In addition, the toxicity of ebselen itself (2, 4, 8\u00a0\u03bcM) on bacterial and mammalian cells was similar (Fig\u00a01A and B) with no effects on bacterial growth (Fig\u00a0EV1). These results indicate that treatment of Ag+ with ebselen in combination exhibits significant selective synergistic toxicity on bacteria over mammalian cells, and the dramatic decrease in MIC of silver against bacteria in the presence of ebselen make the systemic medical use of silver feasible.\nThe large\u2010scale growth inhibition of E.\u00a0coli by Ag+ with ebselen in combination was also observed in shaking testing 15\u2010ml tubes. Escherichia coli DHB4 cells were grown until an OD600\u00a0nm of 0.4, and treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and serial concentrations of ebselen (0, 20, 40, 80\u00a0\u03bcM). The growth curves showed a synergistic bacteriostatic effect of Ag+ with ebselen in combination in LB medium (Fig\u00a02A), and the synergistic bactericidal effect of 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and 80\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen in combination was further confirmed by the colony formation assay on LB\u2010agar plates (Fig\u00a02B). Meanwhile, only 80\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen itself could inhibit E.\u00a0coli growth in first 8\u00a0h, and gains back into normal 12\u00a0h post\u2010treatment (Fig\u00a0EV2). While 40\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen or 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ alone did not inhibit bacterial growth, Ag+ with ebselen in combination resulted in strong inhibition of E.\u00a0coli growth (Fig\u00a02A and B). In line with this, 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen in combination enhanced the frequency of propidium iodide (PI) staining (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00083) (Fig\u00a02C and D). PI is a membrane\u2010impermeable fluorescent dye that has been widely used to detect permeation of cell membrane and dead cells. Above all, these results indicate that Ag+ and ebselen in combination exhibited a selective synergistic effect on bacteria.\n\n## Clinically isolated five most difficult\u2010to\u2010treat MDR Gram\u2010negative pathogens were sensitive to Ag\nThere are five most difficult\u2010to\u2010treat MDR Gram\u2010negative pathogen species in the clinic, which are also typical GSH\u2010positive bacteria: Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Two strains of each species were isolated, and overnight cultures were diluted 1:1,000 times in LB medium, and treated with Ag+ with a serial concentration of ebselen in combination for 16\u00a0h. The synergistic bactericidal effects of Ag+ with ebselen in combination against all 10 tested strains were observed (Table\u00a01). Among these five species, A.\u00a0baumannii and E.\u00a0cloacae are very readily formed drug\u2010resistant strains, which are needed to be treated by carbapenems (our current \u201clast good line\u201d antibiotics) or the fourth\u2010generation cephalosporin in the clinic, including imipenem, cefepime, and cefotaxime. The isolated imipenem, cefepime, and cefotaxime\u2010resistant A.\u00a0baumannii (AB\u20101/2) and E.\u00a0cloacae (ECL\u20101) strains were identified (Appendix\u00a0Tables S1 and S2) and were sensitive to Ag+ with ebselen in combination (Table\u00a01). These results indicate that Ag+ with ebselen in combination might be \u201cthe last life\u2010saving straw\u201d that are active against a range of bacteria with existing resistance, which would increase the correct chance for empirically prescribed therapy, even for infections resistant to our current antibiotics.\n\n## Ag\nSince Ag+ and ebselen are generally thought to be thiol\u2010targeting agents, we detected bacterial TrxR or Trx activities in cells treated by Ag+ with ebselen in combination (Fig\u00a03A and B). While TrxR and Trx activities in cell extracts were not influenced by either Ag+ or ebselen alone, 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen in combination resulted in a dramatic loss of TrxR (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00018) and Trx (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0036) activities (Fig\u00a03A and B). Consistent with this observation, the redox state of Trx1 measured by redox Western blot was also affected by treatment of Ag+ with ebselen in combination. Trx1 was mostly in reduced form in untreated bacteria, which became oxidized upon treatment of drugs in combination (Fig\u00a03C). We also used a Trx2 antibody to detect oxidized Trx2 in the experiment to investigate the effect of treatment on the redox state of Trxs. Reduced Trx2 could not be detected by this antibody probably because of the blockage of the recognition site. None of the oxidized Trx2 was observed upon the treatment, while the positive control diamide\u2010oxidized Trx2 was detected (Fig\u00a03D). These results showed that Trx2 was less sensitive to the treatment compared to Trx1. In addition, the protein levels of Trx1 and Trx2 were not affected by the 10\u2010min treatment with Ag+ and ebselen combination (Fig\u00a03C and D).\nThe addition of 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and 20, 40, or 80\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen also decreased the GSH levels. 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen in combination treatment depleted the functional GSH in 10\u00a0min compared with control (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000021) (Fig\u00a03E). Ebselen alone at 80 and 40\u00a0\u03bcM also reduced GSH levels, albeit less efficiently than the corresponding drugs in combination at the same concentration (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000076 and 0.000029). Instead, neither 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ nor 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen modulated GSH levels in the conditions tested compared with control (P\u00a0=\u00a00.081 and 0.712) (Fig\u00a03E).\nWhether Ag+ with ebselen in combination decreased or depleted GSH could affect protein S\u2010glutathionylation was further explored (Fig\u00a03F). Protein S\u2010glutathionylation was decreased in Ag+ with ebselen\u2010treated bacteria, but not in those incubated only with 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ or 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen alone. Thus, the presence of 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ decreased protein S\u2010glutathionylation when combined with 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen reflecting the loss of GSH (Fig\u00a03F).\nSince Trx and GSH/Grx are major thiol\u2010dependent systems, we investigated the effects of Ag+ with ebselen in combination on Trx or GSH system\u2010deficient E.\u00a0coli redox mutants. Escherichia coli mutants lacking GSH system components (gshA\n\u2212) and living on Trx and TrxR were more sensitive to Ag+ and ebselen treatment compared with the wild type (WT) (Tables\u00a02 and 3, and Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S3). All results showed that Ag+ with ebselen in combination has strong synergistic effects on bacterial Trx and GSH systems, and targeting thiol\u2010dependent systems as a novel antibiotic strategy.\n\n## Silver irreversibly inhibits bacterial Trx and TrxR activities\nCellular TrxR and Trx1 enzyme activities were decreased, while the corresponding protein levels were unaltered by the treatment of Ag+ with ebselen in combination, suggesting that TrxR and Trx were inhibited. Since ebselen is a known reversible competitive inhibitor of bacterial TrxR, we investigated the effect of Ag+ on the activity of E.\u00a0coli TrxR and Trx. When 100\u00a0nM of NADPH\u2010pre\u2010incubated E.\u00a0coli TrxR was incubated with Ag+, the IC50 was about 50\u00a0nM (Fig\u00a04A), similar to the gold compound auranofin (Harbut et\u00a0al, 2015). To detect whether E.\u00a0coli TrxR can be specifically inhibited by Ag+, the enzyme was incubated with Ag+ in the presence of reduced E.\u00a0coli Trx1, the inhibitory efficiency toward TrxR decreased (Fig\u00a04A). This indicated that Trx also reacted with Ag+ and played a protective role for the TrxR. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we further verified that Ag+ interacted with reduced Trx1 and changed its fluorescence spectra (Fig\u00a04B). Incubation with 1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ increased the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of 10\u00a0\u03bcM Trx1. Meanwhile, the fluorescent intensity of 10\u00a0\u03bcM Trx1 decreased when treated with 20\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ (Fig\u00a04B). In line with this, the activity of Trx decreased along with the increase in Ag+ concentration (Fig\u00a04C). The inhibition of Trx1 by Ag+ was irreversible since the Trx1 activity was not recovered after desalting (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00021) (Fig\u00a04D). This indicated that Ag+ formed a tight complex with the sulfhydryl groups in reduced E.\u00a0coli Trx1. All these results show that silver irreversibly inhibits bacterial Trx and TrxR activities.\n\n## ROS is a determining factor for synergistic bactericidal effect of Ag\nOne major function of GSH and Trx systems is to scavenge ROS to keep cellular redox balance and protect against oxidative stress. The inhibition of the Trx system and depletion of GSH may responsible for the elevation of ROS. To determine whether increased ROS levels accounted for the bactericidal effect, we therefore determined ROS levels in Ag+ and ebselen\u2010treated cells. Treatment with either 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ or 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen alone did not change ROS concentrations, while the combination of 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen resulted in increased levels of ROS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00012) (Fig\u00a05A and B). Further, the enhancement of H2O2 levels caused by the treatment with 5\u00a0\u03bcM Ag+ and 20\u00a0\u03bcM ebselen in combination was also verified by Amplex Red\u00a0method (Dwyer et\u00a0al, 2014) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00057) (Fig\u00a05C). In addition, E.\u00a0coli mutants lacking OxyR components (OxyR\n\u2212) that impair E.\u00a0coli dehydratase clusters from H2O2 injury were more sensitive to Ag+ and ebselen treatment in combination compared with the wild type (WT) (Tables\u00a02 and 3, and Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S3). All results showed that lethality of Ag+ with ebselen against bacteria is accompanied by ROS generation.\n\n## Silver with ebselen in combination potentiated bactericidal antibiotics \nThe bactericidal effect of Ag+ with ebselen in combination was also observed in LB medium containing heparinized mice blood (Fig\u00a0EV3). To investigate whether the bactericidal activity of Ag+ with ebselen in combination is also efficient in\u00a0vivo, mice were infected i.p. with 6.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 or 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 MDR E.\u00a0coli ZY\u20101 (Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S4), modeling an acute and a mild peritonitis, respectively. The LD50 of E.\u00a0coli ZY\u20101 administered i.p. was 1.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\u00a0CFU/ml. One hour (acute model) or 24\u00a0h (mild model) after infection, mice were treated i.p. with ebselen, Ag+, or the drugs in combination, or remained untreated. The combination of Ag+ and ebselen led to a significant reduction in bacterial load compared with the control in the mild peritonitis model. Mice treated with ebselen alone or left untreated showed similar levels of bacteria load after 36\u00a0h of infection with 6.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107\nE.\u00a0coli, whereas treatment with Ag+ with ebselen in combination achieved a 100\u2010fold reduction compared with control (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0055) (Fig\u00a06A). Additionally, 80% of mice treated with Ag+ with ebselen in combination survived in the acute peritonitis mice model, compared with 30% in control group (Fig\u00a06B). These findings demonstrated the effective antibacterial effect of Ag+ and ebselen against MDR Gram\u2010negative pathogen in\u00a0vivo.\nAg+ or ebselen alone has been proven to be safe in previous studies (Kohanski et\u00a0al, 2007; Wilkinson et\u00a0al, 2011). To test the toxicity of the combination, we divided five mice per group, which were treated with 6\u00a0mg AgNO3/kg body weight in combination with serial concentrations of ebselen (10, 15, 20, and 25\u00a0mg ebselen/kg body weight). Mice were observed for 7\u00a0days and remained viable with no mortality. Then, we determined whether the doses of Ag+ and ebselen used in this study had a toxic effect on the mammalian host. We evaluated the effect of 25\u00a0mg ebselen/kg and 6\u00a0mg AgNO3/kg body weight in combination on mice, by measuring key metabolite and enzyme concentrations using a Blood Chemistry Analyzer after treatment for 6, 24, and 48\u00a0h. The density of lymphocytes and monocytes and some enzymes, such as alanine transaminase in mice treated with Ag+ and ebselen in combination, were reduced at the initial point (6\u00a0h); however, their values gain back into normal at 24\u00a0h post\u2010treatment (Table\u00a04), indicating that there is a stress response upon the initial treatment. These results demonstrated that Ag+ and ebselen were not toxic for mice at the conditions tested.\n\n## Discussion\nMultiple factors drive the development and spread of MDR bacteria. WHO showed that if we fail to act on this issue then an additional 10\u00a0million lives would be lost each year by 2050, at a cost to the world economy of 100\u00a0trillion USD. A concerted focus since the 1990s on tackling rising MDR Gram\u2010positive bacteria within US and European healthcare systems appears to have been instrumental in\u00a0stimulating the relatively large numbers of products targeting Gram\u2010positive bacteria in recent years. The emergence of MDR Gram\u2010negative bacteria presents a great threat to human life and is a challenge for modern medicine. The five most difficult\u2010to\u2010treat Gram\u2010negative bacteria, K.\u00a0pneumonia, A.\u00a0baumannii, P.\u00a0aeruginosa, E.\u00a0cloacae, and E.\u00a0coli, can be deadly in the clinic, causing urinary tract infections, life\u2010threatening pneumonia and septicemia, with rare antibiotics that can currently combat them or that are being developed. We reported here that the synergistic bactericidal effect of Ag+ with ebselen in combination was efficient against these MDR Gram\u2010negative pathogens (Table\u00a01). Further, results from animal experiments indicated that this new antibiotic combination should be considered as a candidate for clinical trials against MDR bacteria (Figs\u00a06 and EV3, Table\u00a01), and the system targeted by the combination is critical for bacterial survival, and thus, development of resistant mutants is not frequent as described by our previous study (Gustafsson et\u00a0al, 2016).\nThe fact that Ag+ and ebselen were efficiently against clinical isolates of MDR Gram\u2010negative bacteria (Table\u00a01), which indicated that they acted a mechanism that are different from existing antibiotics. The results we presented here proposed mechanisms for the synergistic antibacterial effect of Ag+ with ebselen in combination. Silver and ebselen can directly inhibit E.\u00a0coli TrxR, and fast deplete GSH, which resulted in the elevation of ROS production to determine cell death (synopsis). Thiol\u2010dependent redox pathways regulate various central cellular functions. Thus, Ag+ with ebselen in combination can react with SH\u2010groups in GSH, and particularly Trx and TrxR and possibly many other proteins, indicating that the inhibitory effect of Ag+ with ebselen in combination may involve several cellular targets. In addition, Ag+ and ebselen might target other molecules: For example, diguanylate cyclase and M.\u00a0tuberculosis antigen 85 have been reported to be targets of ebselen (Favrot et\u00a0al, 2013; Lieberman et\u00a0al, 2014). This may impair the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.\nThough most of the Gram\u2010negative bacteria have both Trx and GSH/Grx systems as mammalian cells, and silver can also inhibitory activity against mammalian TrxR (Fig\u00a0EV4), yet the combination of Ag+ and ebselen exhibited selective synergistic toxicity on bacteria (Figs\u00a01 and 6). The reasons for the selective toxicity of Ag+ with ebselen in combination toward prokaryotic cells might be explained by: First, mammalian cells possess various tissue\u2010specific GPxs, which contain Sec in their active site and make them highly efficient to remove hydrogen peroxide with a reaction rate of 108\u00a0M\u22121\u00b7 s\u22121 (Papp et\u00a0al, 2007; Lu & Holmgren, 2009, 2014). In contrast, only a Cys\u2010containing GPx with a low ROS removing capacity is predicted to be present in bacteria (Lu & Holmgren, 2014). Second, ebselen is a substrate of the Sec\u2010containing TrxR of mammalian cells, which makes ebselen act as an antioxidant by facilitating the electron transfer to reduce peroxides and peroxynitrite (Zhao & Holmgren, 2002). Meanwhile, ebselen is an irreversible inhibitor of bacterial TrxR and only blocks the electron transfer via TrxR. The ebselen analog, ebsulfur, was toxic for the parasite Trypanosoma brucei and induced a high level of ROS to enhance the inhibition of trypanothione reductase (TryR) (Lu et\u00a0al, 2013b). The ROS elevation caused by Ag+ and ebselen described here may cause damage in a similar manner. The increased ROS levels in bacteria may also increase ebselen binding resulting in the inhibition of other sulfhydryl\u2010dependent enzymes.\nPrevious work showed that silver can enhance antibacterial effects of classic antibiotics (Morones\u2010Ramirez et\u00a0al, 2013b), and more works reported that the lethality of current antibiotics was accompanied by redox physiology alteration and ROS generation (Dwyer et\u00a0al, 2014; Belenky et\u00a0al, 2015). Our work directly showed that silver with ebselen in combination could target redox system, and has a significant synergistic antibacterial effect on clinic important Gram\u2010negative bacteria.\nCurrent antibacterial strategies are predominantly based on inhibition of cell wall synthesis, inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and replication, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Redox system is a universal anti\u2010oxidative system, which is essential for living organism; inhibition of redox system will result in oxidative stress, which showed a novel antibacterial principle that could be used to screen new antibiotics.\nAll in all, our results with silver and ebselen in synergistic combination implied that targeting bacterial thiol systems was a potent strategy against bacterial infections and a novel promising antibiotic mechanism.\n\n## Bacterial strains\nAll in\u00a0vitro experiments were performed with Escherichia coli (E.\u00a0coli) DHB4 and its derived redox phenotypes (Appendix\u00a0Table\u00a0S3), and clinically isolated multidrug\u2010resistance (MDR) Gram\u2010negative strains (Appendix\u00a0Tables S1, S2 and S4). All in\u00a0vivo experiments were performed with E.\u00a0coli ZY\u20101 (Appendix Table\u00a0S4), which was isolated from the urine of clinical patient in the First Affiliated Hospital of Three Gorges University in Hubei Province, P. R. China, with an approval for research from the Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital of Three Gorges University and\u00a0an informed\u2010consent of the patient. The strain was thoroughly identified and stored in our laboratory. Other clinical isolated MDR\u00a0Gram\u2010negative strains (Appendix\u00a0Tables S1 and S2) were obtained from clinical patients in Renmin Hospital of Three Gorges University in Hubei Province, PRC, with all approvals and informed consents.\n\n## Antibiotics and chemicals\nAll experiments were performed in Luria\u2010Bertani (LB) medium (EMD millipore). Unless otherwise specified, the following concentrations were used for the antibacterial experiments with E.\u00a0coli strains and clinical pathogens: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 20, 40, 80\u00a0\u03bcM 2\u2010phenyl\u20101,2\u2010benzisoselenazol\u20103(2H)\u2010one (ebselen) (Daiichi), and 0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80\u00a0\u03bcM silver nitrate (Sigma\u2010Aldrich). 4\u2010acetamido\u20104\u2032\u2010maleimidylstilbene\u20102,2\u2032\u2010disulfonic acid (AMS) (Invitrogen), protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche), DC\u2122 protein assay (Bio\u2010Rad), propidium iodide (PI) (BD Biosciences), E.\u00a0coli DHB4 TrxR, sheep anti\u2010E.\u00a0coli Trx1 antibody, and rabbit anti\u2010E.\u00a0coli Trx2 antibody were from IMCO Corp.

The cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 600\u00a0nm. The culture treated with 0.8% (v/v) DMSO was used as a control.\n\n## Toxicity analysis of silver with ebselen in combination against mammalian cells\nHeLa cells were purchased from ATCC, and through mycoplasma detection and human cell line authentication by STR analysis (ATCC, U.S.A). HeLa cells cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were seeded in 96 micro\u2010well plates and grown till 70\u201380% confluency. The cells were treated with serial combinations of ebselen and AgNO3 for 24\u00a0h. The cell toxicity was detected by MTT assay (Lewis, 2013).\n\n## Antibacterial effect of silver with ebselen in synergistic combination on the growth of clinical isolated MDR Gram\u2010negative strains\nTen clinical isolated MDR Gram\u2010negative (GSH\u2010positive) strains were grown until an OD600\u00a0nm of 0.4 and were diluted 1:100 into 100\u00a0\u03bcl of LB medium in 96 micro\u2010well plates. Serial dilutions of 100\u00a0\u03bcl ebselen and AgNO3 were added to the individual wells. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined after 16\u00a0h culture at 37\u00b0C. The culture treated with 0.8% (v/v) DMSO was used as a control.\n\n## Detection of bactericidal effect of silver with ebselen in combination on \nEscherichia coli DHB4 cells were grown in 15\u2010ml tubes until an OD600\u00a0nm of 0.4, and treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM AgNO3 and serial concentration of ebselen (0, 20, 40, 80\u00a0\u03bcM) in combination. The survival of untreated E.\u00a0coli was compared with the antibiotic\u2010treated cells by measuring OD600\u00a0nm and counting the colonies. For colony formation assay, cells were harvested at 10\u00a0min, 1, 2 and 4\u00a0h by centrifugation at 7,080\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min and thoroughly washed three times with PBS. The cells were serially diluted in PBS, and 100\u2010\u03bcl cultures were plated on LB plates. The colonies were counted after overnight incubation, and CFU/ml was calculated using the following formula: [(colonies)\u00d7(dilution factor)]/(amount plated).\nFurther, cells cultured and washed as above were harvested at 10\u00a0min by centrifugation at 6,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min and thoroughly washed three times with PBS. Nuclei were stained with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 20\u00a0min in the absence of a cell permeate and analyzed by flow cytometry (CyAn adp, Beckman coulter).\n\n## Measurement of Trx/TrxR activity and GSH amount in silver and ebselen\u2010treated \nEscherichia coli DHB4 cells were grown till the absorbance at OD600\u00a0nm of 0.4 in LB medium, and the bacterial cells were treated with different dilutions of ebselen and AgNO3 for 10\u00a0min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min and thoroughly washed three times with PBS, and then, cells were re\u2010suspended in lysis buffer (25\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 2.5\u00a0mM EDTA, 2.5\u00a0mM EGTA, 20\u00a0mM NaF, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, 20\u00a0mM sodium \u03b2\u2010glycerophosphate, 10\u00a0mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% Triton X\u2010100) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and lysed by sonication. The cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 15,340\u00a0g for 20\u00a0min, and the protein concentration was measured by Lowry protein assay (Bio\u2010Rad DC\u2122).\nEscherichia coli DHB4 TrxR activity in cell extracts was measured by a DTNB reduction activity assay (Holmgren & Bjornstedt, 1995). The experiments were performed with 96 micro\u2010well plates in the solution containing 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 200\u00a0\u03bcM NADPH, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTNB, in the presence of 5\u00a0\u03bcM E.\u00a0coli Trx. The absorbance at 412\u00a0nm was measured for 5\u00a0min with a VERSA micro\u2010well plate reader, and the slope of initial 2\u00a0min was used to represent TrxR activity. The Trx activity was detected by this method coupled with 100\u00a0nM E.\u00a0coli TrxR instead of 5\u00a0\u03bcM E.\u00a0coli Trx in the reaction mixture.\nTo measure GSH levels, 25\u00a0\u03bcg of the cell lysates was added in the solution containing 50\u00a0nM GR, 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 200\u00a0\u03bcM NADPH, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM DTNB. The absorbance at 412\u00a0nm was measured for 5\u00a0min.\n\n## Trx redox state in \nEscherichia coli DHB4 cells were grown till the absorbance at OD600\u00a0nm of 0.4 in LB medium, and the bacterial cells were treated with different dilutions of ebselen and AgNO3 for 10\u00a0min. Western blotting was performed to detect the Trx1 and Trx2 redox state of the ebselen and AgNO3\u2010treated E.\u00a0coli cells. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min and thoroughly washed three times with PBS, and precipitated the protein with 5% TCA in 1.0\u00a0ml. The precipitates were washed with 1\u00a0ml pre\u2010ice\u2010cold acetone for three times and dissolved in 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.5) with 0.5% SDS containing 15\u00a0mM AMS at 37\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h. Proteins were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min to remove the pellets, and the protein concentration was measured by Lowry protein assay (Bio\u2010Rad DC\u2122). Redox state of Trx1 and Trx2 was detected with sheep anti\u2010E.\u00a0coli Trx1 antibody and (Rabbit anti\u2010E.\u00a0coli Trx2 antibody) at 1:1,000 dilution, followed by the detection of Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus.\n\n## Proteins S\u2010glutathionylation in \nTotal proteins S\u2010glutathionylation of the ebselen with AgNO3 in combination\u2010treated E.\u00a0coli cells were detected by Western blotting. Cells were cultured and washed as described above, and re\u2010suspended in lysis buffer (25\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 2.5\u00a0mM EDTA, 2.5\u00a0mM EGTA, 20\u00a0mM NaF, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, 20\u00a0mM sodium \u03b2\u2010glycerophosphate, 10\u00a0mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% Triton X\u2010100, protease inhibitor cocktail) containing 30\u00a0mM IAM. After lysed by sonication, the cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 13,000\u00a0rpm for 20\u00a0min. Protein concentration was measured by Lowry protein assay (Bio\u2010Rad DC\u2122). Samples were incubated with SDS\u2010loading buffer at 90\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min and then separated on the 4\u201312% bolt Bis\u2010Tris gel with MES running buffer (150\u00a0V, 40\u00a0min). Western blotting assay was performed with IgG2a\u00a0mouse monoclonal antibody (VIROGEN, 101\u2010A/D8) for glutathione\u2013protein complexes.\n\n## Synergistic effect of silver and ebselen on the growth of \nEleven E.\u00a0coli DHB4 redox phenotypes were grown until an OD600\u00a0nm of 0.4 and were diluted 1:100 into 100\u00a0\u03bcl of LB medium in 96 micro\u2010well plates.
