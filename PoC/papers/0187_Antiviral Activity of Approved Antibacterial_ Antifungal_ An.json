The drug repurposing approach is an assuring strategy in finding new potential antiviral agents within a short time to overcome the challenges in antiviral therapy.3\nApproved non-antiviral drugs that have demonstrated antiviral efficacy in vitro and animal studies are considered potential antivirals, especially during emergencies and during epidemics.4 Generally, the screening for drug repurposing takes two different experimental approaches, either to do phenotypic assay without knowing the target of the activity or to do a mechanism-based assay knowing the specific target of the antiviral effect, with the first approach being the most frequently applied.5 The targets for antiviral activity could also be either viral components or specific steps during viral infection related to the host cells, such as viral binding to host cells, viral entry into host cells, viral replication, and viral budding.6\nThere are many approved non-antiviral drugs from different classes considered as candidate drugs for repurposing potential, including antibacterial and antiparasitic drugs.3 Although many researches were done to evaluate the antiviral activity of antibiotics, it was stated that caution should be considered when repurposing antibiotics for their antiviral effect, as the inappropriate use of the repurposed drugs could cause an increase in antimicrobial resistance.7 This review article focuses mainly on preclinical studies of phenotypic assays, and mechanism-based assays carried out to evaluate the antiviral activity of approved antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and anthelmintic drugs, and some clinical findings related to it, and the summary of the antiviral effect of the drugs was according to the viral families and the viral species on which the antiviral study of the drug was done. Table 1 and Figure 1 demonstrate the possible mechanisms for the antiviral activity of approved antimicrobial agents.Table 1Possible Mechanism for Antiviral Activity of Approved Antibacterial, Antifungal, Antiprotozoal and Anthelmintic AgentsDrugSuggested Mechanism of ActionType of StudySusceptible VirusReferences1.

Moreover, the effect was suggested to be highly specific since the drug almost completely inhibited HSV-1 infection but did not affect HSV-2 infection.8,9 Further studies proved that the presence of neomycin in the infected tissue at the time of infection almost completely blocked HSV-1 infection, while the addition of the drug later does not affect the normal course of infection; also regarding its mechanism of anti-HSV-1 action evidence suggests that neomycin exerts its effect by specifically inhibiting HSV-1 receptor binding.10 This was further proved by another study that documented that neomycin exerts its effect by two mechanisms: firstly by partial inhibition of the glycoprotein-C dependent binding of the virions, and secondly by inhibition of events that occur after binding the virus to cells.11 Another effective drug is doxycycline, which was documented that when combined in low-dose with monocaprin, it offers an effective treatment for herpes labialis, significantly reducing time to healing and pain.12 Moreover, it was proved that topical application of neomycin in an in vivo model resulted in enhanced expression of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) associated with a reduction in HSV-2 infection.13\nTwo antifungal drugs, posaconazole and ketoconazole showed activity against some strains of herpesviridae. Posaconazole showed broad anti-human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) activities, even against strains resistant to viral DNA polymerase inhibitor drugs. It was also observed that posaconazole increased the anti-HCMV activity of ganciclovir to tenfold its activity, indicating that posaconazole act synergistically with ganciclovir in inhibiting HCMV replication.14 On the other hand, ketoconazole showed activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV), as treatment of human lung cells infected with HSV-1 and \u22122 with ketoconazole resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in viral titer.15\nQuinine, an antimalarial drug, also showed in vitro activity against HSV-1, as demonstrated by a decrease in virus plaques. It was suggested that the quinine exerts its antiviral effect by acting indirectly on the host cells by inducing a cellular defense mechanism that can interfere with multiple events during the virus replication cycle, besides nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) inhibition induced by quinine blocks the gene expression and causes a considerable reduction in the viral infection. It was stated that this indirect mode of action by affecting host cells decreases the chance of viruses becoming resistant to the drug.16\n\n## Drugs Acting on \nSome drugs belonging to the macrolides, tetracyclines, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and cyclic lipopeptide antibiotics, in addition to some antimalarial and antifungal drugs showed ability to inhibit some Flaviviridae viruses.\nThree members of the macrolide antibiotics showed activity against some Flaviviridae viruses. One of them is erythromycin which demonstrated activity against zika virus (ZIKV) both in vitro and in vivo more over the drug was able to protect against vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice, additionally to be able to inhibit dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). In terms of the mechanism of action by which erythromycin affects ZIKV, the drug inhibits viral entry by disrupting viral membrane integrity, resulting in loss of viral infectivity.17 Azithromycin, which is another macrolide antibiotic, was also able to inhibit replication of ZIKV in different in vitro models,18,19 in addition to its ability to inhibit ZIKV infection in vivo as shown in a study that documented that azithromycin was able to prevent zika virus-induced lethality in the suckling mouse model.20 Fidaxomicin also showed potential inhibitory interaction with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of ZIKV in an in silico model, suggesting its probability of acting as a potential RdRp inhibitor.21\nRegarding the effect of tetracycline antibiotics on Flaviviridae viruses, two drugs of this class (demeclocycline and minocycline) showed activity against the West Nile virus (WNV) in vitro, with further investigation in the activity of minocycline showing that additionally to reducing WNV titer in tested cell lines the drug was also able to inhibit WNV induced apoptosis and suppress virus-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its target c-Jun.22 It was also documented that the anti-inflammatory environment induced by minocycline reduced viral cytotoxicity during WNV infection in ex vivo central nervous system (CNS) tissue.23 Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) was also affected by minocycline as the drug showed protective effects in mice infected with JEV demonstrated by a reduction in neuronal apoptosis, microglial activation, active caspase activity, pro-inflammatory mediators, and viral titer.24 Additionally, it was documented that minocycline inhibited the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production associated with JEV infection.25 The spectrum of tetracycline antibiotics against the Flaviviridae viruses also included the DENV as minocycline affected the DENV infection at different stages, such as viral RNA synthesis and intracellular envelope protein expression. Minocycline also modulated host factors, including the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2).26 On the other hand, doxycycline demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects against DENV propagation. Also, the in silico findings showed its ability to interact with critical residues that affect membrane fusion during viral entry.26 In vitro studies also documented that doxycycline could inhibit the DENV serine protease (DENV2 NS2B-NS3pro), and its ability to decrease the virus titter significantly inhibited viral entry and reduce post-infection viral replication.27\nOther antibacterial agents also showed antiviral activity against some Flaviviridae viruses, such as ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic effect on hepatitis C virus (HCV), as Ofloxacin was remarkably effective in inhibiting HCV RNA in Huh-7 cells infection in vitro model.28 Moreover, previous clinical results suggested that combination therapy of IFN and ofloxacin may be effective for hepatitis C management.29\u201331 However, some other findings indicated that the combined administration of \u03b1-interferon and ofloxacin to patients with chronic hepatitis C who have not responded to \u03b1-interferon alone does not increase the primary virological response rate.32 Another drug with an unconfirmed antiviral effect is daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, as some findings documented that daptomycin could be identified as an inhibitor of ZIKV infection in vitro activity against ZIKV strain.33 Other findings stated that treatment with daptomycin was insufficient to lower the percentage of infected cells in vitro below 46% even at the highest dose in the tested cell type.19 Furthermore, neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, showed the ability to enhance the expression of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) associated with a reduction in ZIKV RNA level after topical application in an in vivo animal model.13\nThe inhibitory effect against Flaviviridae viruses was also detected with some antifungal drugs, as an example amphotericin B inhibited the replication of JEV with the reduction in both plaque size and number of the infected cells in a dose-dependent manner. It was indicated that the drug acts at the post-virus-infection step, but not during adsorption of virus to host cells.34 Amphotericin B also causes significant ultrastructural and biochemical changes in hepatitis B virus (HBV) particles, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles disruption into a nonparticulate HBsAg-reactive fraction and a HBsAg-AmB complex fraction with no HBsAg immunoreactivity.35 The effect of amphotericin B on HBV was also observed in another study, as it stated that amphotericin B and ketoconazole exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in the production of HBsAg particles by the human hepatoma cell line in vitro paralleled by a reduction in cellular protein synthesis.36 HCV was also subjected to inhibition by an antifungal drug, as a previous study documented that the replication of a subgenomic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV-1b) replicon can be suppressed by griseofulvin. It decreased the replicon RNA titer in Huh7/Rep-Feo cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, and it was proved that griseofulvin induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in HCV replicon cells. Moreover, it was found that the effect of the griseofulvin and IFN\u03b1 combination on HCV-RNA replication is strongly synergistic.37 Lastly, posaconazole was able to inhibit replication of multiple serotypes of DENV and ZIKV, and reduced viral RNA replication, but not translation of the viral genome, with a suggestion that oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) mediates the antiviral activity of posaconazole.38\nSome antimalarial drugs also showed activity against some Flaviviridae viruses, such as mefloquine which showed activity against DENV39 and ZIKV.33,39 Chloroquine also showed activity against DENV40\u201342 and ZIKV,43,44 in addition to its activity against HCV as demonstrated by in vitro experiments that screened the antiviral activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against HCV in Huh-5-2 cells, in which both drugs were able to reduce the HCV-RNA.45 The additional finding confirmed this inhibitory effect of chloroquine against HCV, which stated that combining chloroquine with IFN\u03b1 exerts a synergistic effect against HCV.46 Another antimalarial drug that showed antiviral activity is atovaquone, which showed antiviral activity against ZIKV and chikungunya virus in Vero cells at small concentrations. The observed antiviral effect was suggested to be via depletion of nucleotides blocking pyrimidine biosynthesis.47 Another study also confirmed this inhibitory effect of atovaquone on ZIKV and chikungunya virus virion production in human cells, and stated that the antiviral effect of the drug occurred early during infection at the initial steps of viral RNA replication. These findings were further proved using an ex vivo human placental tissue model in which atovaquone was able to limit ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner.48 Furthermore, quinine showed the ability to inhibit DENV replication in three different cell lines of human origin, this was associated with a reduction in viral RNA and viral protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, and it was suggested that quinine have the efficacy for stimulating antiviral genes to reduce DENV replication.49\n\n## Drugs Acting on \nThree tetracycline antibiotics showed effect on SARS-CoV-2 in an in silico target-based virtual ligand screening. It was documented that lymecycline and oxytetracycline showed high binding affinity to 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Lymecycline was also predicted to be helicase inhibitors, whereas tigecycline and chloramphenicol (another bacterial protein-synthesis inhibitor) showed high binding affinity to papain-like protease (PLpro).50 There was an inconsistency in the clinical findings regarding macrolide antibiotics as a clinical trial study conducted on SARS-CoV-2 infected patients found that azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination than hydroxychloroquine treatment as a single drug.51 In contrast, another study reported no benefit with the combination of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin at the same dose scheme reported in the previous study.52 Regardless of the clinical trial studies, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin showed in vitro synergistic effect on SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations compatible with that obtained in the human lung.53 Besides, azithromycin by itself showed clear in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2,54 also knowing that azithromycin is an acidotropic lipophilic weak base some studies were carried out on the drug itself to understand the mechanism of its antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2. The results revealed that it could correct organellar pH in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung epithelial cells. It can also correct CF cell-autonomous innate immunity-related properties and responses, correct furin activity, and transform growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) levels in CF cells.55\nIn silico studies also documented that fidaxomicin could be a potential inhibitor for RdRp, as it showed potential inhibitory interaction with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.56 Quinolone antibiotics also demonstrated antiviral effect against Coronaviridae viruses as recently it was documented that ciprofloxacin acts as acidotropic lipophilic weak bases and shows in vitro effects on intracellular organelles. It showed the ability to correct the pH of acidified intracellular compartments in CF respiratory epithelial cells, indicating that the drug could act on the intracellular organelles pH in respiratory epithelial cells, a highly relevant target for SARS-CoV-2.55 Also, an in silico study showed that ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin exert a strong capacity for binding to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), as it binds to the protein active site more strongly than native ligand, suggesting that the drug may be a potential inhibitor of the tested protease.57 Additionally, clinical findings documented that treating SARS-CoV-2 infection with moxifloxacin and arbidol could help reduce viral load and inflammation during infection.58 Moreover, some antimycobacterial drugs also demonstrated activity against Coronaviridae viruses, such as rifampicin which appeared as a promising drug showing good binding energy to SARS-COV-2 Mpro in a molecular docking study,59 also clofazimine showed in vitro activity against the proliferation of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in Fcwf-4 cells,60 and in a study about the effect of clofazimine on SARS-CoV-2 infection the drug appeared to suppress isolated single infected cells (ROI 4), while a small number of syncytia (ROI 3) were still observable suggesting a replication inhibition.61\nAntifungal drugs also showed antiviral activity against Coronaviridae viruses, as an in silico study stated that caspofungin is predicted to be a potential inhibitor against SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and having an affinity for both viruses Mpro may indicate the potential of this drug as an inhibitor for other coronaviruses with similar Mpro binding sites and pocket structures.62 Also, caspofungin showed ability to bind with SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 protein and block the polymerase activity in vitro, and it was documented that the drug could effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro.63 Another drug is clioquinol which was identified as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect in vitro. In addition, all three compounds showed potent anti-exopeptidase activity against recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2) and inhibited the binding of rhACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, and it showed a strong correlation with inhibition of rhACE2 and rhACE2-RBD interaction.64\nSARS-CoV-2 virus Mpro was also targeted by mebendazole, an anthelmintic drug, as an in silico study showed that mebendazole exhibited high binding affinity with mebendazole SARS-CoV-2 virus Mpro binding pocket, and it also showed activity against the virus in vitro in Vero E6 cells.65\n\n## Drugs Acting on \nIn vivo studies documented that neomycin significantly increases survival against influenza A virus A/PR8 (hvPR8) infection as observed in a respiratory tract infection model.13 Some members of the macrolide antibiotics also showed activity against influenza A virus, one of them is azithromycin which showed activity against the pandemic influenza 2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09) in vitro as the study showed that progeny virus replication was remarkably inhibited by treating viruses with azithromycin before infection; however, azithromycin administration after infection did not affect this process, and the mechanism of action was suggested to be by blocking viral internalization into host cells during the early phase of infection and targeting newly budded progeny virus from the host cells and inactivated their endocytic activity, while in vivo intranasal administration of azithromycin to influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus-infected mice successfully reduced viral load in the lungs and relieved infection-induced hypothermia.66 Also, clinical studies showed that combination therapy of oseltamivir with azithromycin demonstrated more efficacy in treating influenza A(H1N1) infected patients than using oseltamivir alone.67,68 Another macrolide antibiotic that showed activity against influenza A virus is clarithromycin which showed a significant inhibitory effect on influenza A virus infection in vitro; more specifically, the antiviral effect was detected when the infected cells were treated with clarithromycin after viral adsorption. Also, clarithromycin did not affect influenza virus hemagglutination, membrane fusion, and viral sialidase activities, which indicate that clarithromycin acts on the middle to late stage of the viral replication cycle resulting in inhibition of progeny virus production from the infected cells.69 Clarithromycin also was able to reduce viral titers and the content of cytokines in cultured human tracheal epithelial cells infected with influenza A virus (H3N2), along with the reduction in viral RNA in the cells, susceptibility to virus infection, and reduced NF-kB proteins.70 Clarithromycin\u2019s prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy was examined against avian influenza virus (H5N1) and (H7N9) infections in cynomolgus monkeys; it suppressed H5N1 virus-induced severe signs of disease in the treated monkeys. It also inhibited virus propagation in tracheal samples and the production of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of monkeys infected with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses.71 The prophylactic administration of clarithromycin showed more suppressive effects on clinical signs of disease and viral titers than the therapeutic administration.71\nAdditionally, some tetracyclines also demonstrated activity against the influenza A virus, such as minocycline, which inhibited H7N9 influenza A virus replication in silico and in vitro.72 A combination of doxycycline with oseltamivir synergizes against swine flu (H1N1 influenza A virus) infection,73 while in vivo studies have indicated that treatment with doxycycline attenuates treatment attenuates acute lung injury in mice infected with virulent influenza H3N2 virus.74 On the other hand, rifampicin showed inconsistent findings as it was able to inhibit hemagglutinating and infective virus yields of influenza A/PR/8/34 (HONl) infection in embryonated eggs,75 but the drug showed limited activity against the virus in vivo.76\nSome antifungal drugs also showed activity against influenza A viruses as in an in vitro study itraconazole and posaconazole efficiently inhibited the propagation of Influenza A virus (IAV) in the cell culture model without being cytotoxic. The mode of action of itraconazole was suggested to be based on several targets and includes both priming of the interferon response and the induced imbalance of cellular cholesterol. Also, the antiviral effect of itraconazole was confirmed in the mouse model, where the administration of itraconazole led to a drastic reduction in mortality and a significant increase in the survival rate.77\nInfluenza A virus replication was also inhibited by the antimalarial drug chloroquine in vitro, with the IC50s of chloroquine against influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2 being lower than the plasma concentrations reached during treatment of acute malaria.78 Quinine also showed activity against influenza A virus, as it showed slight but consistent inhibiting activity on the course of influenza virus infection in mice,79 This activity against influenza A virus was also observed against the strain H1N1/2009 virus replication in vitro, with both chloroquine and quinine being identified as lysosomotropic alkalinizing agent.80\n\n## Drugs Acting on \nSome macrolide antibiotics demonstrated activity against some picornaviridae viruses, such as azithromycin, which was documented to possess anti-rhinoviral activity in bronchial epithelial cells as shown in a study that used in vitro models of normal primary human bronchial epithelial cell (HBEC) culture.16 It significantly reduced rhinovirus replication and release; the drug also increased rhinovirus-1B and rhinovirus-16 induced interferons and interferon-stimulated gene mRNA expression and protein production.81 Another drug is clarithromycin which showed effect on rhinovirus infection in A549 alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, the study documented that clarithromycin could inhibit the rhinovirus induced increase in intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) mRNA and protein, as well as the rhinovirus induced secretion of IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8, and an overall reduction in rhinovirus titer, with the degree of reduction in virus titer being greater in cells pretreated with clarithromycin than in cells administered with clarithromycin at the time of the infection.82 Another study also documented the ability of clarithromycin to inhibit rhinovirus-induced expression of host cell adhesion molecules, including fibronectin and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules, subsequently preventing secondary bacterial infections in rhinovirus infected cells.83 Despite these positive in vitro findings, a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial showed that clarithromycin treatment has little or no effect on the severity of cold symptoms or the intensity of neutrophilic nasal inflammation in experimental rhinovirus-16 colds. Many factors could have accounted for the lack of anti-inflammatory effect in this clinical study, such as the nature of the stimulus used, interspecies differences, variations in the response of the nasal and tracheal airways, and the effect of the duration of antibiotic therapy on the immune response.84 Erythromycin also showed the ability to reduce the viral titers and RNA of rhinovirus in infected cultured human tracheal epithelial cells in vitro. Also, it decreased the number of acidic endosomes in the infected epithelial cells. It was suggested that erythromycin inhibits rhinovirus infection by reducing ICAM-1, partly due to the inhibition of activated NF-kB and blocking the rhinovirus RNA entry into the endosomes.85 Another study of the effect of erythromycin on rhinovirus infected human",
