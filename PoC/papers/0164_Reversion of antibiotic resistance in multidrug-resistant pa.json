Among these pathogenic bacteria, of particular concern are ESKAPE (Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species), which are responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections worldwide with high morbidity and mortality2,3. With the increasing incidence of drug resistance in ESKAPE clinical isolates, bacterial infection-associated diseases are becoming harder to treat. Notably, carbapenems, colistin, and tigecycline are recognized as extremely crucial antibiotics and last options against these drug-resistant bacteria. However, the emergence of carbapenemase4, mcr-1-encoded phosphoethanolamine transferase5, and tet(X)-mediated flavin-dependent monooxygenase6,7 in bacteria from animal and human source leaves few choices for clinicians from these traditional pipelines. Meanwhile, few novel antibiotic entities with distinct scaffolds or modes of action have been approved for clinical use during the past decades due to the huge scientific and commercial challenges in the development of new drugs8,9. There is a dire need to identify alternative strategies to address these infections.\nRepurposing drugs as potential antibiotic adjuvants to reverse antibiotic resistance and enhance antibiotic activity represents a simple but effective approach to counter this problem10\u201312. For example, our previous studies have shown that hypoglycemic agent metformin could resensitize tet(A)-positive bacteria to tetracyclines through disrupting the functions of efflux pumps13. Melatonin, which has been applied for treating sleep disturbances and circadian disorders, potentiated colistin activity against MCR-positive bacteria by enhancing the membrane damage14. Anti-HIV agent azidothymidine decreased Tet(X3/X4)-mediated bacterial resistance to tigecycline in Escherichia coli via specifically inhibiting DNA synthesis and suppressing resistance enzyme activity15,16. In addition, other compounds such as natural products or synthetic drugs have also been demonstrated to enhance the activity of existing antibiotics. The condensed tannins of American cranberry fruit, cranberry proanthocyanidin, increased the activity of a broad range of antibiotic classes against opportunistic pathogens by interfering with intrinsic resistance mechanisms17. Synthetic tobramycin\u2212lysine conjugates displayed a synergistic effect with minocycline or rifampicin against clinical multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa isolates18. Benzydamine is a locally acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with local anesthetic and analgesic properties by selectively binding to prostaglandin synthetase19,20. Recently, benzydamine was found to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via down-regulating the expression of interleukin-1\u03b221. In addition, benzydamine drastically reduced oral mucositis even at doses >50\u2009Gy in head and neck cancer patients22. However, the adjuvant potential of benzydamine to existing antibiotics is still not fully understood.\nIn this study, we characterized the synergistic activity of benzydamine with different classes of antibiotics, and found that it drastically potentiated tetracyclines activity against various MDR pathogens. Importantly, benzydamine dissipated membrane potential (\u25b5\u03a8) in both Gram-positive and negative bacteria, which in turn upregulated the transmembrane proton gradient (\u25b5pH) and promoted the uptake of tetracyclines. Meanwhile, benzydamine synergized with doxycycline on killing a spectrum of bacterial pathogens carrying mecA, blaMBL and/or mcr genes, as well as tet(X) by triggering oxidative damage. Notably, benzydamine potently rescued the activity of doxycycline in multiple animal infection models infected by MDR MRSA T144 or E. coli B2. This study reveals the therapeutic potential of benzydamine as an antibiotic adjuvant for the treatment of infection caused by MDR pathogens.\n\n## Benzydamine potentiates doxycycline activity in both drug-susceptible and -resistant bacteria\nWe first evaluated the synergistic activity of benzydamine with eight classes of antibiotics against MDR E. coli B2 using checkerboard broth microdilution assays. Out of these drugs, colistin, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline showed synergistic activity with benzydamine, whereas kanamycin displayed an antagonistic effect with benzydamine (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01 and Supplementary Table\u00a02). Remarkably, the combination of benzydamine and doxycycline possessed the highest synergistic effect (FIC index (FICI)\u2009=\u20090.188), which enabled the MIC value of doxycycline to decrease from 32 to 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL (16-fold). We further tested the potentiation of benzydamine to other tetracyclines, including tetracycline, oxytetracycline, minocycline, and tigecycline. As expected, their antibacterial activity was all substantially improved in the presence of benzydamine (Supplementary Table\u00a02). Subsequently, the checkerboard assays were performed in both drug-susceptible and -resistant bacteria. Interestingly, the combination of benzydamine and doxycycline showed synergistic effect in all test bacteria, including hard-to-treat pathogenic bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) T144 (FICI\u2009=\u20090.188), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) A4 (FICI\u2009=\u20090.375), blaNDM-5-positive E. coli G6 (FICI\u2009=\u20090.375), mcr-1-carrying K. pneumoniae D120 (FICI\u2009=\u20090.375) and tet(X6)-positive A. baumannii C222 (FICI\u2009=\u20090.5). In detail, the MIC values of doxycycline in drug-susceptible bacteria (including S. aureus ATCC 29213, E. coli ATCC 25922, S. Enteritidis ATCC 13076, and E. coli MG1655) were all lower than 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL. And in the presence of 0.25\u00d7 MIC of benzydamine, the MICs of doxycycline were decreased by 4-fold. In contrast, the MICs of doxycycline in drug-resistant pathogens ranged from 16 to 32\u2009\u03bcg/mL, which dropped sharply to 1\u20138\u2009\u03bcg/mL at 0.25\u00d7 MIC of benzydamine, corresponding 4\u201316-fold potentiating. Overall, this combination displayed a higher synergistic effect on drug-resistant bacteria than -susceptible bacteria, suggesting that its activity is also related to the inhibition of resistance determinants (Fig.\u00a01 and Supplementary Table\u00a03).Fig. 1Synergistic activity between benzydamine and doxycycline against drug-susceptible and -resistant bacteria by checkerboard assay, related to Supplementary Table 3.Dark blue regions represent higher cell density. Data represent the mean OD600 nm of two biological replicates. Synergy is defined with FIC index \u22640.5.\nNext, we assessed whether the synergistic activity of this combination would result in increased toxicity, including hemolytic activity on mammals RBCs and in vivo toxicity in mice23. Surprisingly, no detectable toxicity in hemolysis rate, body weight, and blood biochemical analysis was found in the benzydamine\u2013doxycycline combination treatment (Supplementary Figs.\u00a02 and3). These data suggest that benzydamine is a safe and potent antibiotic adjuvant to tetracyclines.\n\n## Benzydamine dissipates the electric potential (\u0394\u03a8) component of the proton motive force and promotes the uptake of doxycycline\nOur prior results have shown that benzydamine is a universal adjuvant to tetracycline antibiotics in all tested strains, but antagonizes kanamycin activity in E. coli B2. We next assessed the interaction of benzydamine and kanamycin in a panel of bacteria. As a consequence, a remarkable antagonism effect was found in all bacteria (FICI\u2009>\u20092.0, Supplementary\u00a0Fig.\u00a01 and\u00a04). The opposite effect of benzydamine in combination with doxycycline or kanamycin inspired us to speculate that the mechanism of action of benzydamine may be directly related to the destruction of the bacterial proton motive force (PMF)24. In bacteria, the transmembrane transfer of proton H+ by the respiratory chain results in an electrochemical gradient, named PMF. It consists of two parts, electric potential (\u0394\u03a8) and transmembrane proton gradient (\u0394pH)25. Damage to one will be compensated by increasing another to achieve dynamic balance26. Previous studies have indicated that the uptake of tetracyclines by bacterial cells depends on \u0394pH, whereas aminoglycosides utilize the \u0394\u03a8 component for transport, therefore, we are concerned that benzydamine might target the \u0394\u03a8 component of bacterial\u00a0PMF. To test our hypothesis, a fluorescent probe 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3(5))27 was used to assess membrane potential changes induced by doxycycline, benzydamine alone, or their combination in four representative strains (S. aureus ATCC 29213, MRSA T144, E. coli ATCC 25922 and E. coli B2; two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria). Consequently, no obvious fluorescence change was observed in the doxycycline treatment group. In contrast, benzydamine treatment resulted in rapid disruption of electric potential in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a02a). Next, we measured the fluorescence with one to fourfold MIC of doxycycline or combination with 250\u2009\u03bcg/mL of benzydamine. Benzydamine plus doxycycline indeed resulted in increased fluorescence compared with doxycycline alone (Fig.\u00a02b), suggesting that benzydamine is definitely a potential dissipator of \u0394\u03a8. The extracellular pH values are also related to the PMF. A previous study demonstrated that the antibacterial activity of the dissipater of \u0394\u03a8 will be strengthened when the extracellular pH changed to the alkaline values28. Consistent with the membrane potential results, the MICs of benzydamine were reduced by four to eightfold when the pH changed from 5.5 to 9.5 in both Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria (Fig.\u00a02c). An intact PMF is required for the bacterial function in flagellar secretion, thus, we next examined the integrity of PMF through swimming motility experiments29. Exposure of four strains to sub-inhibitory concentrations of benzydamine drastically decreased bacterial motility (Fig.\u00a02d), suggesting the impaired PMF in benzydamine-treated bacterial cells. These evidence demonstrates that benzydamine disrupts the PMF by targeting \u0394\u03a8 component.Fig. 2Benzydamine disrupts proton motive force (PMF) in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.a Benzydamine dissipates membrane potential in bacteria. Fluorescence intensity of DiSC3(5) in S. aureus ATCC 29213, MRSA T144, E. coli ATCC 25922, and E. coli B2 after treatment with increasing concentrations of benzylamine and doxycycline (fourfold MIC) was monitored. Drugs were added into DiSC3(5)-probed cells at 90\u2009s. b Combination of doxycycline and benzydamine (250\u2009\u03bcg/mL) displays increased disruption on membrane potential compared with doxycycline alone. c Decreased MIC values of benzydamine against four strains in an alkaline environment. \u25b5\u03a8 becomes the main component of PMF as the external pH is shifted to an alkaline environment. d Benzydamine inhibits the swimming motility of four bacterial strains. Overnight cultures were standardized to OD600 nm of 0.5, and inoculated on 0.3% agar plates for 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Scar bar, 1\u2009cm.\nAfter showing that benzydamine selectively disrupted the \u0394\u03a8, we set out to test whether \u0394pH will be compensatorily upregulated. A membrane-permeable fluorescent probe termed BCECF-AM30 was used to monitor intracellular pH changes in four strains. Interestingly, benzydamine led to the acidification of the cytoplasm in Gram-positive bacteria, but alkalization of cytoplasm in Gram-negative bacteria (Fig.\u00a03a). Nevertheless, both these actions triggered the upregulation of \u0394pH in bacteria. Given that the increasing \u0394pH may contribute to the uptake of tetracyclines, thus we next determined the intracellular doxycycline accumulation after exposure to varying concentrations of benzydamine31. As expected, benzydamine supplementation remarkably enhanced the content of doxycycline in four strains (Fig.\u00a03b). Tetracyclines act by specifically binding to the 30S subunit of the ribosome, thus inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis32. Therefore, the uptake and accumulation of tetracyclines are of importance for their antibacterial activity. Collectively, our results indicate that benzydamine dissipates the \u0394\u03a8, in turn, upregulates the \u0394pH, thereby promoting the uptake of tetracyclines.Fig. 3Benzydamine upregulates \u25b5pH and promotes the intracellular accumulation of doxycycline.a Upregulation of \u25b5pH in BCECF-AM-labeled bacterial cells after exposure to varying concentrations of benzydamine. In Gram-positive bacteria, benzydamine decreases fluorescence and the cytoplasmic pH. In contrast, benzydamine increases fluorescence and the cytoplasmic pH in Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli ATCC 25922 and E. coli B2). b Benzydamine supplementation dose-dependently promotes the intracellular accumulation of doxycycline in bacteria. Intracellular antibiotic content was determined by monitoring the fluorescence of doxycycline (excitation wavelength, 405\u2009nm; emission wavelength, 535\u2009nm). All data from three biological replicates were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, and the significance was determined by non-parametric one-way ANOVA (*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P\u2009<\u20090.001, ****P\u2009<\u20090.0001).\n\n## Doxycycline plus benzydamine is bactericidal against MDR bacteria and biofilm-producing bacteria\nIt has been widely acknowledged that tetracyclines belong to bacteriostatic antibiotics. We reasoned whether the benzydamine\u2013doxycycline combination would possess bactericidal activity, which would markedly extend its therapeutic potential. To test this hypothesis, we performed time-killing experiments on various MDR pathogens. Impressively, a direct synergistic bactericidal effect was observed in rich growth conditions (Fig.\u00a04a). Specifically, either 32\u2009\u03bcg/mL doxycycline or 250\u2009\u03bcg/mL benzydamine showed slight bactericidal activities. In comparison, the combination of doxycycline plus benzydamine (32\u2009+\u2009250\u2009\u03bcg/mL) exhibited excellent bactericidal activity, especially for E. coli B2. Besides, to determine whether benzydamine has the potency to combat metabolically repressed and non-replicating cells, we tested the bactericidal activity of this drug combination in the nutrient-free buffer. Remarkably, this combination retained potent bactericidal activity against E. coli B2 (Fig.\u00a04b).Fig. 4Combination of doxycycline and benzydamine displays bactericidal activity against various drug-resistant bacteria.a Killing activity of doxycycline plus benzydamine in LB media against MDR Gram-positive bacteria (MRSA T144 and VRE A4) and Gram-negative bacteria (A. baumannii C222, K. pneumoniae D120, and E. coli B2). b Time-killing curves of doxycycline, benzydamine alone, or their combination in PBS against E. coli B2. The initial cell density is about 108 CFU/mL. All data were performed from three biological replicates and shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD.\nThe formation of antibiotic-tolerant biofilms greatly affects the efficacy of antibiotics33,34. To explore whether benzydamine supplementation can enhance doxycycline activity against the biofilm-producing bacteria, we performed the formation and eradication of biofilms experiments in the presence or absence of different concentrations of benzydamine. As shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a, b, the combination of benzydamine at 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL with sub-MIC of doxycycline significantly inhibited biofilm formation of MRSA T144 and E. coli B2. Notably, in the biofilm inhibition assay, the benzydamine plus doxycycline at concentrations of \u22642\u2009\u03bcg/mL did not have bacteriostatic activity against two test strains, indicating that the inhibition of biofilm formation at these concentrations was not owing to the effect on bacterial growth. Besides, in the presence of benzydamine, the eradication effect of doxycycline on mature biofilm was markedly enhanced (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c, d). Taken together, we unexpectedly found that the combination of doxycycline plus benzydamine displays great bactericidal activity against various MDR pathogens in different metabolic states, including metabolically active cells, antibiotic-tolerant cells, and biofilm-producing bacteria.\n\n## Benzydamine aggravates oxidative damage and inhibits the function of MDR efflux pumps\nHaving shown that the synergistic bactericidal activity of the benzydamin\u2013doxycycline combination, we reasoned that benzydamine may trigger other unknown modes of action except for the promotion of doxycycline uptake. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we performed transcription analysis of E. coli B2 under treatment with doxycycline or doxycycline plus benzydamine for 4\u2009h. The comparison of treatment with combination to doxycycline alone revealed an upregulation of 35 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and downregulation of 14 DEGs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a). Go annotation analysis showed that these DEGs were involved in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06b). KEGG enrichment analysis displayed that these DEGs with increased expression were involved in ribosome synthesis, and DEGs with repressed expression was associated with glutamate metabolism and GABA shunt (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c, d). Notably, genes with 30S and 50S subunits were upregulated, which may be caused by increased accumulation of doxycycline that inhibits protein synthesis (Fig.\u00a05a). In contrast, multidrug efflux pumps-related genes, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system-associated genes, and acid resistance-related genes were obviously decreased in the combination treatment group (Fig.\u00a05b).Fig. 5Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of E. coli B2 after treatment with doxycycline plus benzydamine in comparison to doxycycline alone.Significant upregulated (a, P\u2009<\u20090.05, Log2Fold change\u2009\u2265\u20091) and downregulated DEGs (b, P\u2009<\u20090.05, Log2Fold change\u2009\u2264\u2009\u22121) in combination treatment group compared with doxycycline monotreatment.\nBased on the transcription results, we next performed a series of phenotype experiments to elucidate the other functions of benzydamine. First, we evaluated the activity of drug combinations in the different pH growth environments via time-killing experiments. We found that it had almost no bactericidal effect in the acid media, however, this combination showed enhanced bactericidal activity while a change in pH to alkaline values. After treatment for 4\u2009h, the bacteria were all killed in the MHB broth at pH 8.5 and 9.5 (Fig.\u00a06a). These data were in agreement with the previous observations that the antibacterial activity of benzydamine was strengthened in the alkaline conditions and the genes associated with acid resistance were downregulated. Recently, several studies reported that GAD systems, which were downregulated in the combination group, play a critical role in protecting bacteria against oxidative stress35,36, we hypothesized that the potentiation of benzydamine to antibiotics may also correlate to enhanced oxidative damage. Thus, we tested the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)37 in E. coli B2 treated by either benzydamine or in combination with doxycycline. Surprisingly, benzydamine markedly promoted the generation of ROS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a06b). Meanwhile, the combination treatment showed higher ROS levels compared to doxycycline monotreatment (Fig.\u00a06c). Accordingly, ROS has been recognized as one of the common mechanisms in the antibiotic-mediated killing of bacteria. The over-production of ROS in the benzydamine\u2013doxycycline combination gives an interpretation of their synergistic bactericidal activity. To further verify it, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, was added in time-killing assays. As shown in Fig.\u00a06d, the potentiation of benzydamine to doxycycline was greatly impaired when incubation with 2 or 4\u2009mM NAC. Finally, we used a fluorescent dye rhodamine B to assay the function of the efflux pump in bacteria under the treatment of benzydamine (Fig.\u00a06e). As a result, it showed that the activity of the efflux pump was dose-dependently suppressed by benzydamine, which further promoted the accumulation of doxycycline in MDR bacteria. Collectively, these data together demonstrate that benzydamine enhances oxidative damage via triggering the production of ROS and inhibiting the function of MDR efflux pumps (Fig.\u00a06f).Fig. 6Benzydamine promotes oxidative damage and inhibits the function of the efflux pump in E. coli.a Time-killing curves of E. coli B2 after treatment with the combination of doxycycline and benzydamine in different pH media from 5.5 to 9.5. b Benzydamine promotes the production of ROS in a dose-dependent manner. c Doxycycline plus benzydamine (250\u2009\u03bcg/mL) shows higher ROS generation compared to doxycycline alone. Fluorescence probe 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to monitor the levels of ROS in cells (\u03bbexcitation\u2009=\u2009488\u2009nm, \u03bbemission\u2009=\u2009525\u2009nm). All data from three biological replicates were presented as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, and the significance was determined by non-parametric one-way ANOVA (*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, ***P\u2009<\u20090.001, ****P\u2009<\u20090.0001). d The addition of ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine weakens the potentiation of benzydamine to doxycycline. e Benzydamine drastically impairs the function of efflux pumps in both MRSA T144 and E. coli B2. Rhodamine B (\u03bbexcitation\u2009=\u2009540\u2009nm, \u03bbemission\u2009=\u2009625\u2009nm) was used to characterize the activity of efflux pumps in bacteria. f Schematic illustrations of the potentiating mechanisms of benzydamine to tetracyclines in the fight against drug-resistant pathogens.\n\n## Benzydamine rescues doxycycline efficacy in vivo infection models\nIn view of the excellent synergy of doxycycline and benzydamine against MDR pathogens in vitro, we tested whether they have potent activity in vivo using two animal infection models infected by MRSA T144 or E. coli B2. First, we used G. mellonella larvae infection models to explore their efficacy in vivo. As shown in Fig.\u00a07a, the infected larvae with the combination therapy of doxycycline plus benzydamine (50\u2009+\u200950\u2009mg/kg) resulted in above 80% survival during 5 days, which was higher than the doxycycline monotreatment (P\u2009=\u20090.0174 or 0.0397, corresponding to MRSA T144 and E. coli B2, respectively). In addition, the efficacy of this combination therapy in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model was evaluated (Fig.\u00a07b). Similarly, a single dose of doxycycline plus benzydamine (50\u2009+\u200910 or 50\u2009+\u200950\u2009mg/kg) reduced bacterial burden in mice thighs compared with doxycycline alone (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). These data demonstrate the benzydamine plus doxycycline has a great synergy effect in vivo.Fig. 7Combination of doxycycline and bezydamine is efficacious in various animal infection models.a Survival rates of Galleria mellonella (n\u2009=\u20098 biologically independent animals per group) infected by MRSA T144 or E. coli B2 and then treated with doxycycline (50\u2009mg/kg) or benzydamine (50\u2009mg/kg\u2009) alone or a combination of doxycycline plus benzydamine (50\u2009+\u200950\u2009mg/kg). P values were determined using the two-sided log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test. b Combination of doxycycline (50\u2009mg/kg) and benzydamine (50\u2009mg/kg) significantly reduces the thigh bacterial loads of mice (n\u2009=\u20096 biologically independent animals per group) infected by MRSA T144 or E. coli B2 (105 CFUs per mouse) compared with doxycycline monotherapy (50\u2009mg/kg). P values were calculated using a two-sided Mann\u2013Whitney U test.\n\n## Discussion\nThe occurrence of MDR phenotype in pathogenic bacteria undermines the clinical efficacy of antibiotics and leaves no available options for the treatment of intractable infections38,39. Despite many ongoing effects in identifying new classes of antimicrobial agents40,41, few antibiotics have been approved for clinical use in the past 20 years. Accordingly, the average cost of research and development of a new drug from discovery to regulatory approval is US$2.6 billion, which takes >10 years, and the successful launch is less than one thousandth42,43. As such, alternative strategies are warranted to confront this serious global crisis. Repurposing non-antibacterial drugs as potential antibiotic adjuvants are gaining traction in both the public and private sector44. In this study, we revealed the synergistic effect of benzydamine, a widely used non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug in the clinic, in combination with three classes of antibiotics against MDR E. coli B2. Most importantly, benzydamine displayed the greatest synergistic activity with tetracyclines, which belong to broad-spectrum antibiotics. For various MDR pathogens, including MRSA, VRE, NDM/MCR/Tet(X)-expressing Gram-negative bacteria, the doxycycline\u2013benzydamine combination showed unprecedented synergistic activity. Biofilm-producing bacteria are important causes of chronic and recurrent bacterial infection but are commonly overlooked in drug discovery. We found that the doxycycline\u2013benzydamine combination is able to prevent the formation of S. aureus and E. coli biofilm, as well as eradicate the established biofilms. These data further support the notion that benzydamine is a potential antibiotic adjuvant candidate to reverse bacterial resistance. Consistent with our finding, the prior study provided a preliminary observation regarding the antibacterial activity of the benzydamine-tetracyclines combination, whereas the antibacterial spectrum, mechanisms of action, and in vivo potency are not explored45.\nBacterial energy metabolism such as PMF has a critical role in cellular activities including material transport, flagellar motility, and ATP synthesis by the F1F0-ATPase46. The disruption of PMF would inhibit the basic functions of bacteria and accelerate its death. Recently, using a deep learning approach, a new broad-spectrum antibiotic termed halicin was identified to selectively destroy the PMF47. Molecules I1- I3 and D1-D3, the potential modulators of PMF, showed killing activity against MRSA by preventing electron transport and ATP synthesis28. Generally, PMF is comprised of \u0394\u03a8 and \u0394pH. To maintain the bacterial PMF, dissipation of either component would be compensatory increased by another. In our study, we uncovered that benzydamine dissipated the \u0394\u03a8 component of PMF in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, in turn, increased the \u0394pH, which was critical for the uptake of tetracyclines. These findings were consistent with the previous studies that tetracyclines uptake is driven by \u0394pH48, whereas aminoglycosides uptake is highly dependent on \u0394\u03a849. In addition, the successful paradigm of daptomycin depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane provides a proof-of-concept for PMF-targeted antimicrobial agents50. These examples suggest that bacterial PMF is a promising target for the development of novel antimicrobial agents and antibiotic adjuvants. Toxicity concerns are critical factors that limit the clinical trials of new drugs51. Meaningfully, our experiments tentatively demonstrated that the combination of doxycycline and benzydamine exhibited negligible toxicity in a murine model. Nevertheless, considering the potential side effects of benzydamine in clinic such as nausea and vomiting52, more preclinical studies are needed for exploring the therapeutic potential of this particular combination. Moreover, we proposed that the structure optimization of benzydamine and the use of functionalized drug delivery system53 may contribute to reducing the toxicity and improving the effectiveness of this drug combination.\nFurthermore, the doxycycline\u2013benzydamine combination showed excellent synergistic bactericidal activity for all test MDR isolates, implying that the action of benzydamine is not merely to promote the uptake of tetracyclines. Transcriptomic analysis coupled with phenotype experiments indicated that benzydamine not only triggered the generation of ROS, but also downregulated the GAD system that protects bacteria from oxidative damage. These modes of action resulted in an oxidative burst, which has been proved to be important for antibiotic-mediated killing. In addition, the functions of MDR efflux pumps in bacteria were severely destroyed, partly owing to the dissipation of PMF by benzydamine. It would be interesting to investigate the potential of benzydamine as a new and broad-spectrum inhibitor of MDR efflux pumps.\nTo conclude, our findings reveal that non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug benzydamine may serve as a potential antibiotic adjuvant to restore the activity of clinically relevant antibiotics particularly tetracyclines against infections caused by MDR pathogens. In addition, the elucidation of modes of action of benzydamine highlights the remarkable potential of PMF downregulators as a feasible adjuvant therapy to tackle the escalating concern of antibiotic resistance.\n\n## Bacterial strains and reagents\nAll strains used in this study were listed in Supplementary Table\u00a01. The bacteria were stored in nutrient broth supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. For experiments, all strains were grown in Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) or on LB agar (LBA) plates. Antibiotics were obtained from China Institute of Veterinary Drug Control and other chemical reagents were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China) or TCI (Shanghai, China).\n\n## MIC determinations\nThe MICs of all antibiotics and benzydamine were determined using the broth dilution method, according to the CLSI 2018 guideline54. All drugs were twofold diluted in MHB and equally mixed with bacterial suspensions in a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning, New York, USA). After 16\u201320\u2009h incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C, the MICs were defined as the lowest concentrations of drugs that no bacteria can be\u00a0detected.\n\n## Checkerboard analyses and FIC index determination\nThe fractional inhibitory concentrations (FIC) indices were measured by the checkerboard analyses55. In brief, 100\u2009\u03bcL of MHB was added into each well of a 96-well plate with an 8\u2009\u00d7\u20098 matrix, then the antibiotics and compounds were t",
