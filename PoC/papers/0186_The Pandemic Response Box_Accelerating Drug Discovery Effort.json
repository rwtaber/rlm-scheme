  "abstract": "The current Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the need for a more coordinated and forward-looking investment in the search for new medicines targeting emerging health care threats. Repositioning currently approved drugs is a popular approach to any new emerging disease, but it represents a first wave of response. Behind this would be a second wave of more specifically designed therapies based on activities against specific molecular targets or in phenotypic assays. Following the successful deployment and uptake of previous open access compound collections, we assembled the Pandemic Response Box, a collection of 400 compounds to facilitate drug discovery in emerging infectious disease. These are based on public domain information on chemotypes currently in discovery and early development which have been shown to have useful activities and were prioritized by medicinal chemistry experts. They are freely available to the community as a pharmacological test set with the understanding that data will be shared rapidly in the public domain.",

  "full_text": "## Selection of\nthe Pandemic Response Box Compounds\nA\nlist of antibacterial and antiviral compounds that either had been\nin clinical development or else represent promising scaffolds from\ndrug discovery was compiled from public domain databases. Promising\ncompounds from the discovery list were reviewed by a panel of medicinal\nchemistry experts and were then combined with compounds selected from\nchemotypes in clinical development. The details of the workflows are\noutlined below. In general, compounds were not triaged using physicochemical\nproperties or structural alerts unless specified. From a compound\ncollection perspective, this would risk prematurely eliminating certain\ndrug classes or mechanisms of action. Such risks could be addressed\nduring future lead optimization campaigns.\n\n## Antibacterial\nand Antiviral Development Compounds\nAll antiviral and antibacterial\ndevelopment compounds were abstracted\nfrom the Cortellis (Clarivate Analytics) database with molecules included\nsince 1990 (see S1 for details). Via this\nprocess, 233 antibacterial development candidates were identified,\nand therefore, no further triage of this list was performed. Abstraction\nof antiviral development candidates from the Clarivate Analytics Cortellis\ndatabase identified 1336 compounds, so further triage was required.\nThese antiviral compounds were clustered and analyzed for molecular\nproperties such as molecular weight, published potency in cellular\nassays, and pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS17). Viral selectivity and molecular target information were\ncaptured for each compound, and one compound was picked per viral\nfamily. In addition, one compound was picked per molecular target\nfor those targets not covered by the preceding organism-based selection.\nCompound selection was guided by a Harrington multiparameter optimization\nto bias toward potency and lower molecular weight:18Weighted compounds\nin the 300\u2013400 MW range favorably\n(+1 score), monotonically dropping off to zero at 200 or below and\n500 or aboveWeighted compounds with\npIC50 > 6 favorably\n(+1 score), monotonically dropping off to zero at pIC50 = 5 or belowNegatively weighted compounds\n(\u22122 score) with\nany reactive functional groups or PAINS alertsGenerated a combined score for each molecule by summing\nup the three weighting values\nWithin\neach cluster the compound with the highest MPO\n(multi parameter optimization) score18 was\nselected as the representative. A list of 235 antiviral development\ncompounds was selected using this method, which when combined with\nthe 233 compounds from antibacterial selection, resulting in a set\nof 468 compounds representing development scaffolds.\n\n## Antibacterial and Antiviral Discovery Scaffolds\nFrom\nthe ChEMBL database, compounds with defined antiviral or antibacterial\nactivity (<10 \u03bcM) were abstracted. This produced a list of\nmore than 20\u202f000 compounds that was initially filtered by application\nof the following physicochemical properties (these were chosen to\neliminate compounds with extreme properties but remain relaxed enough\nto be inclusive at this stage):MW 200\u2013700; clogP 0\u20137; HBA (hydrogen bond\nacceptors) <20; HBD (hydrogen bond donors) <10Number of: acids <3; bases <4; rings <11; rotatable\nbonds <25; sp2 atoms <25No PAINS alert\nThe revised set of 8331\ncompounds was then subjected\nto the following triage (Figure 1). Compounds that were overlapping with the previous\nClarivate Analytics list of development compounds were removed. Compounds\nwere then clustered based on a Tanimoto similarity of >0.5, and\nthe\ncompound with the lowest molecular weight selected to represent each\ncluster. Clustering was performed with an in-house algorithm that\nemploys single linkage clustering and Morgan fingerprints. All pairwise\nsimilarity values were calculated and compounds placed in the same\ncluster if their Tanimoto similarity was above a threshold value.\nMultiple similarity threshold values were used to enable interrogation\nof cluster data at different levels of granularity. For example, compounds\ncould be viewed trellised by cluster calculated using a low similarity\nvalue (e.g., 0.5), and colored by cluster calculated using a higher\nsimilarity threshold (e.g., 0.7) to give a more informed view of the\nspace being analyzed. Some clusters were eliminated from the analysis\ndue to the presence of reactive functionalities such as aldehydes,\nthiols, and oximes. This method selected 1000 compounds.\nThe molecular targets and target pathogens for the original 20\u202f000\nChEMBL hits were reviewed. Compounds with a pathogen target or a molecular\ntarget not already covered by the first 1000 compounds were prioritized\nper target or organism on the basis of their MPO scores as described\nabove. This selected an additional 200 compounds. Finally, since this\noverall initial list of 1200 promising discovery compounds was biased\n2:1 in favor of antibacterials, a second member of each antiviral\ncluster was added, resulting in a total of 748 antiviral compounds,\n1543 discovery compounds in total.\nThese 1543 compounds were\nthen reviewed by an industry-experienced\nmedicinal chemistry panel. Two reviewers were randomly assigned per\ncompound, and each reviewer was asked to score a compound simply as\nselected or nonselected. Compounds selected by both reviewers were\nreclustered to 70% similarity19 to reduce\nthe number of compounds representing each cluster to no more than\ntwo. The coverage of targets and organisms was then reanalyzed to\nidentify any mechanisms that were no longer covered, and in that case,\ncompounds previously rejected by the reviewers were proposed for reintroduction\nto cover these gaps. The resulting compounds were reduced to a collection\nof 224 antibacterial and 204 antiviral discovery compounds, selected\nwith a preference for high potency, low clogP, and avoidance of complex\nchemical structures.\n\n## Antifungal Compounds\nA list of 300\nantifungal compounds from discovery and development phases including\nfungicides was extracted from the Clarivate Analytics Cortellis database.\nThere is limited structural diversity among antifungals as compared\nwith antibacterial and antiviral compounds, and the set also contained\nmultiple formulations of the same compound. Formulation duplicates\nand complex natural products were removed from the list to bring it\nto a collection of 80 compounds. Since these compounds are representative\nof antifungal targets reported in the literature, and given our earlier\nexperience of observing attrition at the acquisition (procurement\nor synthesis) stage, all these compounds were included in the final\nlist of compounds for procurement and synthesis.\n\n## Selection of\nthe Final List\nFeedback from some of the\noriginal testing groups working on the Malaria or Pathogen Boxes had\nunderlined that 400 seemed to be the optimal number for a Box. This\nis especially important for groups working in neglected disease areas\nwith limited resources and with pandemic pathogen assays, which have\nto be performed in biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities. The selection\nprocess still left us with a set of 457 antibacterial and 439 antiviral\ncompounds that was triaged further to reduce the list to a reasonable\nnumber for acquisition and provide a slot for inclusion of a substantial\nnumber of antifungal compounds (Figure 2).\nAntibacterial compounds were reclustered by Tanimoto\nstructural\nsimilarity of >0.7 and also separately clustered by target mechanism.\nOne commercially available compound was taken from each structural\ncluster, and one was taken from each target cluster. For clusters\nwhere compounds were not commercially available, one compound was\nselected for synthesis based on structure, launch phase (higher launch\nphase prioritized), and simplicity of synthesis. Representative compounds\nfrom the clusters with no listed molecular targets were also selected.\nThis list was then supplemented with launched antibacterial compounds,\nproviding 294 compounds in total. This set was then reviewed a final\ntime by anti-infective experts to select 229 compounds for acquisition\n(procurement or synthesis).\nSimilarly, for antivirals, compounds\nwere clustered by structure,\ntarget virus, and molecular target, if known. Using this combination,\n245 clusters were identified, and a representative from each cluster\nwas selected on the basis of commercial availability or synthetic\nsimplicity. From clusters that lacked either a defined molecular target\nor a known target organism, one compound was selected. This list was\nfurther supplemented with launched compounds and shared with experts\nfor final selection. After a final visual check, 230 compounds were\nselected to ensure minimum chemical overlap and representation of\nclusters.\nA final list of 539 compounds, including 80 antifungals,\nwas assimilated\nfor procurement or synthesis. Compounds with high cost of synthesis\n(>$1000 for \u223c25 mg) were eliminated at this stage, leaving\naround 40% of the compounds planned for synthesis. As experienced\nearlier with the Malaria and Pathogen Boxes, a 20% attrition was observed\ndue to unexpected synthetic difficulties, high cost, or extended lead\ntime of starting materials or reagents. Furthermore, some of the synthesized\ncompounds were not included in the box because less than 30 mg could\nbe made. Of the 400 compounds that made it to the box, 164 were synthesized de novo.\n\n## Composition of Pandemic Response\nBox\nThe final set of Pandemic Response Box compounds comprises\n201 antibacterial,\n153 antiviral, and 46 antifungal compounds, with some of them reported\nas active in multiple disease areas (Figure 3). The initial aim was an approximate equal\nsplit between discovery and development/launched compounds. However,\nthe extreme synthetic complexity and lack of an affordable commercial\nsource for many of the development/launched compounds resulted in\na larger proportion of discovery compounds in the final box (Figure 4). These molecules\nact on a wide variety of targets, as summarized in Figure 5.\nEach 96-well plate has 16 wells left empty to allow for the\naddition\nof the appropriate positive and negative controls for the biological\nassay. The plate layout of the Pandemic Response Box has been designed\nto be flexible and to accommodate different screening setups. The\nwells contain 10 \u03bcL of a 10 mM solution in DMSO, supplied in\nV-shaped 96-well plates and are shipped frozen. The antifungal compounds\nare plated on Plate A, antibacterials on plate A\u2013C and antivirals\non plate D and E. Nine compounds that could not be solubilized to\nproduce 10 mM DMSO solutions are provided as 2 mM stocks. The Pandemic\nBox is available free of charge from MMV upon request (www.mmv.org/mmv-open/pandemic-response-box). The details of the compound set are in Supplement\nS2, which lists structures, SMILES, molecular mass, calculated\npolar surface area, target class, chemical name, and MMV code. Importantly,\nthere are considerable additional public domain data available for\nthese molecules within databases such as ChEMBL.20 A literature or patent reference has been included for\nany compound not listed in ChEMBL.\n\n## Roll Out\nof the Pandemic Response Box Compound\nSet\nSince the launch of the box in 2019 over 140 requests\nfor the compound set have been received, indicating the great interest\namong researchers to screen high-quality compound collections. The\nwide geographic distribution of the recipients (Figure 6) is a testament to the demand for this type\nof discovery tool, with 42% coming from Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\nMany of the recipient laboratories are located in regions where epidemic\noutbreaks or pandemic origins are frequent. The distribution pattern\nof this box is similar to what was observed with the Pathogen Box,\nwhere 36% of the boxes went to these regions.\nTo date, more than 50% of the Pandemic Response Boxes have been\nsent for screening against various viruses, including corona viruses\nand bacterial pathogens (Figure 7). A sudden spike in requests for the Box for antiviral\nscreening was observed in 2020, and by March 2020, MMV had already\nshipped a few copies for screening in SARS-CoV2 assays. The set has\nbeen screened in multiple assays developed to identify potential drugs\nfor treatment of SARS-CoV2. This has led to the identification of\nactive compounds in vitro(21) that are being further characterized. The box has also been screened\nagainst other different high-priority pathogens, many of which have\nbeen listed as such by the U.S. CDC (Centers for Disease Control)\nand WHO (World Health Organization).\nThis is in stark contrast with\nscreening campaigns run with the\nPathogen Box, where only 5% of requests were for antiviral screening.\nOn the other hand, fewer screens have been performed against kinetoplastids\nand Apicomplexa.\nScreening of the Pandemic Response Box has\nresulted in 11 publications\nso far.21\u221231 Such a lag is similar to what was observed for earlier boxes with\nthe peak 2\u20133 years after launch, as seen in Figure 8. Throughout 2020 and early\n2021, the pandemic has shifted research, with a focus on SARS-CoV2,\nimpacting the number and delaying publications.",
