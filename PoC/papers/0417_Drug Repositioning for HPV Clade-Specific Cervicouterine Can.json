  "full_text": "## 1. Introduction\nCervical cancer (CC) is a major public health concern and ranks fourth worldwide in both incidence and mortality among women [1]. A substantial share of the burden is concentrated in low and middle-income countries, where access to timely diagnosis and effective treatment remains limited and coverage of prophylactic vaccination programs is insufficient [2]. As a consequence, nearly 482,000 deaths are projected by 2040, representing a 38.2% increase compared with 2022 [1]. These figures underscore the urgent need to advance effective and accessible therapeutic strategies to improve survival and quality of life for patients.\nEtiologically, CC is attributable almost entirely to persistent infection with high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) [3], whose oncogenes function as key carcinogenic drivers [4,5]. During tumor progression, HPV helps sustain malignancy and may promote invasiveness [6,7]. Interestingly, high-risk genotypes display marked biological diversity that shapes molecular programs and clinical outcomes [8]. This diversity is evident at the level of HPV phylogenetic clades, of which the most clinically relevant are alpha-7 (A7; comprising HPV 18, 39, 45, 59, 68, 70, 85, and 97 genotypes) and alpha-9 (A9; comprising HPV 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, 58, and 67 genotypes) [9,10]. In line with these groupings, tumors associated with HPV clade A7 are typically less differentiated, more likely to harbor integrated viral transcripts, and more aggressive, patterns that correlate with poorer prognosis and shorter recurrence-free survival [9,11]. By contrast, tumors linked to HPV clade A9, generally retain epithelial differentiation, show higher keratin expression, and predominantly exhibit episomal viral transcripts with lower levels of genomic integration, features that together are associated with comparatively better outcomes [9,11]. Despite these differences, it remains uncertain whether HPV genotype influences therapeutic response, because the available evidence is inconsistent [12,13,14]. Consequently, genotype is not incorporated into routine clinical decision making, and management of advanced CC continues to rely on surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with cisplatin as the mainstay despite substantial toxicity and limited specificity [15,16,17,18]. Although targeted agents directed at VEGF, EGFR, or PD-L1 have shown promise, their clinical use remains limited and overall prognosis is still poor [19,20].\nWithin this context, the search for new therapeutic strategies is constrained by the high cost, long timelines, and high attrition of de novo drug development. Only about one in 5000 to 10,000 anticancer candidates ultimately secures Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, and each new molecular entity typically requires more than US $2 billion and approximately 13 years from discovery to market [21]. As a practical alternative, drug repurposing identifies new indications for already approved agents and thereby offers a faster, less expensive, lower-risk, and operationally efficient pathway to effective treatments compared to novo discovery [22]. In oncology, multiple successes have been reported for drugs originating both within and outside cancer therapeutics [23]. However, progress in cervical cancer has been comparatively slow, largely due to tumor heterogeneity and the limited translation of preclinical findings into clinical benefit [20,24,25]. This highlights the need for systematic and rigorous evaluation of repositioning candidates to accelerate therapeutic advances in this disease.\nBuilding on this landscape, drug repurposing has evolved from an empirical practice into a systematic and precision oriented discipline that integrates multi-omics and pharmacological resources with computational analytics to align disease mechanisms with existing agents, thereby advancing system level target discovery and therapeutic design [26,27,28]. A central pillar of this framework is expression-based connectivity mapping, which compares disease transcriptional profiles with drug perturbation signatures and prioritizes compounds whose profiles are inversely correlated with the disease state; this approach is grounded in the original Connectivity Map and its next generation LINCS compendium that together provide millions of drug\u2013gene expression relationships for systematic inference [29,30]. Within oncology, methodologic syntheses and case studies show how primary in silico integration, secondary prioritization, and tertiary experimental validation can be assembled into an efficient pipeline for precision repurposing across tumor contexts [22,31,32]. Empirical applications of these strategies have demonstrated predictive accuracy and translational potential, with reversal drug signatures successfully applied and validated across multiple cancer contexts, including hepatocellular carcinoma, Ewing sarcoma, small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, among others [33,34,35,36]. Although transcriptome-guided drug prioritization has also been applied to cervical cancer, available studies remain limited and methodologically diverse [37,38,39]. Expanding these efforts with systematic analyses that integrate patient-level transcriptional data and HPV clade-associated molecular programs may help refine candidate discovery for this malignancy.\nIn this context, the Open Cancer Therapeutic Discovery (OCTAD) platform provides an open framework for implementing transcriptome-based connectivity mapping across patient cohorts [33,40]. By constructing disease signatures, matching them against large drug perturbation repositories, and summarizing anticorrelation scores, the framework enables reproducible and scalable identification of compounds with potential activity across cancer subtypes [40]. Therefore, by leveraging transcriptional programs stratified by HPV clade and applying OCTAD screening, the present study aims to generate a well-supported and prioritized list of pharmacological candidates for cervical cancer that can serve as a robust resource for future preclinical and experimental validation.\n\n## 2.1. Differential Expression Analysis Across HPV Clades Supports Both Shared and Clade Related Transcriptional Programs\nBuilding on previous genomic studies reporting that high risk HPV phylogenetic clades differ in molecular landscapes and clinical behavior [9,11,41], we divided our dataset of primary cervical carcinomas into HPV clade A7 and HPV clade A9 according to tumor genotype (Supplementary Table S1) [10,42]. Before the comparative analyses, we verified that key clinical features were similarly distributed between clades; both FIGO stage and histological type showed no significant differences (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We then performed differential gene expression analysis for tumors versus controls using edgeR, DESeq2, and limma-voom (Figure 1A). Most genes showed consistent expression patterns across methods, and we defined a consensus signature as the intersection of the three analytical outputs. Based on this definition, we identified 1455 underexpressed and 548 overexpressed genes in HPV clade A7 tumors, while HPV clade A9 tumors displayed 2037 underexpressed and 883 overexpressed genes (Figure 1B). Interestingly, we observed overlap between the two clades, with 53.5% of overexpressed and 60.6% of underexpressed genes shared (Supplementary Figure S1).\nTo explore the biological implications of these signatures, we performed functional enrichment analysis (Figure 1C). As expected, several pathways were shared between both clades, which is consistent with the fact that all samples correspond to primary tumors with comparable clinical stage and histological type distributions. These common processes primarily involved cell cycle regulation, chromosome segregation, extracellular matrix organization, and immune related functions. Beyond these similarities, each clade displayed distinct enrichment patterns: HPV clade A7 tumors displayed upregulation of cytoskeletal programs, including microtubule binding and annealing activity. In contrast, HPV clade A9 tumors exhibited upregulation of interferon mediated signaling and DNA helicase activity, alongside downregulation of histone kinase activity and intracellularly calcium gated channel activity. Overall, these results support the idea that, while tumors with presence of HPV clade A7 and HPV clade A9 share a broad transcriptional program, each one may exhibit distinct functional features consistent with their phylogenetic origin [11,41,43,44]. Such divergence has been suggested to contribute to differences in tumor biology and could potentially influence variability in treatment response [12,13,14].\n\n## 2.2. Drug Candidates for Repositioning Across HPV Clade Groups in Cervical Cancer\nReversal based transcriptomic approaches have been used to identify compounds with expression profiles opposite to disease programs, showing consistent results across arious cancers and experimental models [33,45,46,47]. Following this rationale, we calculated summarized Reversal Gene Expression Scores (sRGES) values for drugs in HPV driven cervical cancer, thereby generating a comprehensive landscape of potential repositioning opportunities across both HPV clade A7 and HPV clade A9. For the HPV clade A7 signature, 5569 compounds were evaluated, of which 931 corresponded to FDA-approved drugs. In the case of HPV clade A9, we obtained 4014 compounds that were tested, including 693 FDA-approved.\nTo further contextualize these results, we performed enrichment analysis of the FDA-approved drugs (Supplementary Figure S2). Using Medical Subject Headings categories (MeSH), we observed significant enrichment for pharmacological classes such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), estrogen antagonists, and Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, reflecting both well-established anticancer agents and broader therapeutic categories. In parallel, ChEMBL target-based annotations highlighted recurrent involvement of molecular families including HDAC isoforms, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and nuclear hormone receptors. Notably, these enrichments were supported by multiple independent drugs converging on the same categories or targets, thereby reinforcing the biological plausibility and therapeutic relevance of the predicted candidates.\nAccording to the OCTAD framework, drugs with summarized reversal gene expression scores (sRGES) below \u22120.20 are considered to exhibit the most representative and biologically meaningful reversal effects across benchmark analyses [40]. Following this criterion, we focused on the most significant candidates, defined as drugs with sRGES \u2264 \u22120.20, and we identified 63 compounds that represent the strongest predicted reversal of the clade related transcriptional signatures (Figure 2). Of these, 31 were shared between HPV clade A7 and clade A9; however, their sRGES values varied across clades, suggesting that the same drug may exert a different predicted strength of transcriptomic reversal depending on the underlying clade-related expression profile. By contrast, the remaining 32 compounds were exclusive to a single group, defining clade-related candidate sets. Within the FDA-approved subset, 10 drugs met the significance threshold for HPV clade A7 and 21 for HPV clade A9. Together, these findings outline a therapeutic landscape that encompasses both broadly shared and clade restricted agents, emphasizing the potential to explore pan-clade repositioning strategies alongside approaches tailored to the distinct molecular contexts of HPV A7 and A9 tumors.\nHeatmap of FDA-approved drug candidates with significant reversal potential (sRGES \u2264 \u22120.20) across HPV clade A7 and HPV clade A9 cervical cancer signatures. Rows correspond to clades and columns to individual drugs, ordered by consensus sRGES. The color scale represents sRGES (darker blue = stronger predicted reversal). The annotation bar at the top indicates compounds common to both clades (green), unique to HPV clade A7 (orange), or unique to HPV clade A9 (purple).\n\n## 2.3. Validation of Predicted Drug Response\nFollowing the OCTAD workflow, we evaluated whether more negative sRGES scores translate into better pharmacologic response in the most relevant cell lines (Figure 3). Interestingly, we observed consistent and directionally concordant associations for both sample groups. In HPV clade A7, sRGES showed a positive correlation with the logarithm of the median half maximal inhibitory concentration (log10 [median IC50]) and a negative correlation with the area under the drug response curve (AUC). Here, IC50 represents the concentration of a drug required to reduce cell viability by 50%, with lower values indicating greater potency. On the other hand, the recomputed AUC, as defined in PharmacoGx, reflects the integral of the drug response across doses, calculated as the area of (1\u2013viability); in this framework, higher AUC values indicate stronger overall sensitivity (Supplementary Figure S3). Thus, our results show that stronger transcriptomic reversal, captured by more negative sRGES values, is associated simultaneously with lower IC50 and higher AUC. The same trend was observed in HPV clade A9, supporting that negative sRGES values consistently track with increased pharmacologic sensitivity across clades. Together, the concordance between sRGES and drug response strengthens the evidence that our top candidates provide a robust foundation for experimental validation and clade aware drug repositioning.\n\n## 2.4. Evidence in Cervical Cancer Models for Predicted Candidates\nUsing the PubMed strategy described in Section 4.7, we conducted a targeted literature screen covering recent studies to identify previous experimental or clinical evidence supporting our predicted drug candidates in cervical cancer (Supplementary Table S4). This analysis revealed compounds that have reached clinical evaluation, including vorinostat and SN-38 as active components, which have been tested in phase II or advanced clinical settings in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer [48,49,50], as well as etoposide in combination regimens [51]. Several additional candidates showed antitumor activity in vivo in cervical cancer models, including palbociclib, fulvestrant, pitavastatin, simvastatin, methotrexate, pyrvinium, and closantel, through effects such as tumor growth suppression, radiosensitization, or chemotherapy potentiation [52,53,54,55,56,57]. A broader set of drugs, such as ivermectin, amodiaquine, quinine, bortezomib, dasatinib, raloxifene, duloxetine, panobinostat, nifuroxazide, and penfluridol, demonstrated in vitro activity in cervical cancer cell lines, including cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, pathway inhibition, and enhanced response to standard agents [58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68]. The complete list of compounds is provided in Supplementary Table S4, which offers a qualitative, study level corroboration of our computational predictions.\n\n## 3. Discussion\nAccumulating evidence indicates that phylogenetic clades of high risk HPV contribute to distinct biological programs in CC [11,41], and our results are consistent with this knowledge. The clade stratified transcriptional signatures in this study revealed a shared malignant core between HPV clade A7 and HPV clade A9, encompassing pathways linked to known drivers of cervical carcinogenesis such as epigenetic dysregulation and histone deacetylase activity [69,70]. At the same time, we observed clade-related differences in gene expression patterns. These differences appear biologically consistent with prior multi-omics studies reporting clade dependent epigenetic modulation, including variation in DNA methylation, chromatin organization, and viral\u2013host interactions [11]. In this context, there are several plausible contributors to this divergence, one of which could be the behavior of the viral genome: HPV18 (HPV clade A7) is frequently found fully integrated into the host genome, whereas HPV16 (HPV clade A9) can persist partially as episomal DNA and shows a lower integration frequency [41,71]. Integration events often occur at fragile or regulatory genomic regions and can generate highly active enhancer regions that amplify nearby oncogenes and reshape local transcriptional programs [71,72].\nHowever, several aspects should be considered when interpreting these findings. It is well established that CC biology is shaped by both intrinsic host factors and viral characteristics [73]. In this context, although we did not detect major differences in key clinical features between the analyzed HPV clade groups, the transcriptional distinctions observed here may also reflect additional layers of heterogeneity, including patient-specific biology, features of the tumor microenvironment, and immune composition [74,75]. Moreover, each HPV clade encompasses multiple genotypes, which may introduce variability not fully captured in our analysis. Nevertheless, classifying CC according to HPV lineage provides a more refined alternative to treating all tumors as a single group and offers a biologically grounded rationale for therapeutic decision making. Since HPV genotyping is already part of routine clinical practice [15], clade-based stratification may represent a practical and clinically meaningful extension that could inform future treatment prioritization.\nThis study also has data-level constraints. All disease signatures were derived from bulk RNA-seq, which captures an averaged signal across tumor, immune, stromal, and vascular compartments [76]. Consequently, the observed clade-related transcriptomic differences may also be shaped by variation in cellular composition and the tumor microenvironment [77]. To enhance the biological resolution of future analyses, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data should be integrated to separate epithelial from non-epithelial components, elucidate how HPV lineage influences tumor and microenvironmental programs, and evaluate drug reversal within specific cellular contexts [78]. In addition, this study relies entirely on publicly available datasets, which ensure reproducibility and transparency but inherently limit discovery to the scope of existing cohorts and perturbational profiles. Integrating these large-scale resources with newly generated experimental data would allow the validation and refinement of the computational predictions presented here. Despite these limitations, bulk transcriptomic reversal based on public data remains a powerful and predictive strategy, as similar frameworks have successfully identified active compounds that later advanced to translational validation [33,34,35,36], underscoring its continued relevance as a robust approach for uncovering biologically meaningful therapeutic candidates.\nMethodologically, we used the OCTAD framework to prioritize compounds whose perturbational transcriptomic profiles oppose the clade-related disease signatures in CC. We adopted thresholds for cell line similarity and transcriptomic reversal scoring (sRGES) that were established and validated by OCTAD through extensive benchmarking across pharmacogenomic datasets, which demonstrated consistent associations between reversal strength and drug sensitivity [40,79]. Nevertheless, these thresholds are not absolute, and modifying them may influence the number of prioritized compounds. In this context, it would be of great interest for future studies to explore alternative parameter settings; however, assessing whether such modifications could yield improved predictive or therapeutic performance would require systematic experimental benchmarking. Even so, our analysis supported the validity of these parameters, as the obtained sRGES values showed coherent correlations with drug sensitivity across representative cell lines and aligned with recent reports, since some of the top-ranked compounds have already shown experimental or clinical activity in CC. Although we focused on the top predicted candidates in this study, we also provide the complete list of evaluated drugs to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Altogether, these findings support the robustness of our results and position this work as a biologically grounded approach that generates hypotheses for drug repositioning in HPV-related CC.\nThese correlations supported the internal consistency of our results but should be interpreted with caution, since pharmacogenomic cell lines may not fully recapitulate HPV clade\u2013specific diversity. Future work could strengthen this validation through regression models that account for additional biological factors. Nevertheless, our literature assessment revealed that several of the prioritized compounds already exhibit antitumour activity in cervical cancer, whereas others remain unexplored and represent promising opportunities for future research. To strengthen these findings, upcoming studies should explore the top-ranked compounds in models representative of both HPV clades, assessing viability, apoptosis, and pathway modulation such as HDAC inhibition or estrogen receptor signaling. Complementary in vivo approaches using xenograft systems would provide stronger biological evidence and enhance the translational relevance of these predictions. Altogether, such studies could yield direct mechanistic insight and refine the therapeutic potential of the proposed compounds.\nBuilding on these considerations, the reversal analysis revealed coherent pharmacological themes that mirror dysregulated biology in HPV-associated cervical cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibition emerged across clades, consistent with epigenetic alterations [80]. HDACs regulate chromatin structure and transcription, and their abnormal activity silences tumor-suppressor genes while sustaining the functions of viral oncoproteins [72,81]. Inhibition of these enzymes restores pro-apoptotic and cell-cycle control, as demonstrated for vorinostat through blockade of HPV18 DNA amplification and for panobinostat through induction of apoptosis via autophagy [63,82,83]. Early clinical exploration has also shown encouraging results, including the combination of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in recurrent cervical and other squamous carcinomas, and increased immune activation when HDAC inhibition is combined with proteasome blockade [48,83].\nWe also identified hormone-modulating agents among the top-ranked candidates, consistent with the established role of estrogen signaling in HPV-related CC. In HPV transgenic models, fulvestrant and raloxifene induced pronounced tumor regression [56,84], while in cervical cell systems, raloxifene suppressed oestradiol-driven proliferation and reduced E6/E7 transcription [67], supporting the biological plausibility of anti-estrogen strategies in HPV-positive CC.\nOn the metabolic front, mevalonate-pathway blockade attenuates oncogenic signaling by reducing prenylation of small GTPases, thereby impacting RAS\u2013MAPK and PI3K\u2013AKT cascades [85]. In CC models, simvastatin suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis, and potentiated cytotoxic chemotherapy via broad inhibition of prenylation-dependent pathways [57], while pitavastatin promoted oxidative-stress-mediated DNA damage with caspase-9/3 activation and PARP cleavage [86,87], highlighting metabolic rewiring as a shared vulnerability and a rationale for combinatorial testing.\nSignals also appeared among antimicrobial/antiparasitic agents. Pyrvinium inhibited Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, triggered apoptosis, and potentiated cisplatin in CC systems [52]; closantel reduced angiogenesis and tumor growth in zebrafish xenografts [53]; monensin curtailed tumor growth in vivo while targeting Wnt/\u03b2-catenin [88]; and nifuroxazide suppressed STAT3 with pro-apoptotic effects [61]. By contrast, ivermectin showed antiproliferative effects only at supraphysiological concentrations, limiting its translational feasibility [58,89]. These drug classes should therefore undergo careful evaluation of potency and therapeutic relevance in HPV-associated CC before any clinical consideration.\nSeveral recovered agents overlapped with conventional cytotoxics. DNA-targeting drugs likely reflect broad antitumour activity; nonetheless, irinotecan (SN-38) combined with cisplatin has demonstrated efficacy in CC, with phase II response rates approaching 60% [49,50,90], while etoposide plus cisplatin has provided consistent benefit in recurrent settings [51,91,92]. Mechanistically compelling candidates also included bortezomib, which stabilizes p53 and PDZ-domain tumor suppressors (hDlg, hScrib) to counteract HPV oncoproteins [64,65], producing synergistic tumor regression when combined with cisplatin in HeLa xenografts [93].\nAdditional targeted signals were noted for CDK4/6 and mTOR pathways: palbociclib limited proliferation and induced apoptosis via oxidative stress in CC models, and in combination with SHetA2 suppressed phospho-Rb and tumor growth in SiHa xenografts [55,94]. By contrast, temsirolimus achieved disease stabilization with few objective responses in recurrent/metastatic disease, underscoring the need for biomarker-guided or combinatorial approaches [95]. We also observed activity from antipsychotic agents modulating calmodulin, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and autophagy (penfluridol, chlorpromazine), although dose requirements and CNS adverse effects pose translational constraints [62,96].\nMany of the pharmacologic classes prioritized by our signatures are mechanistically consistent with CC biology, reflecting a convergence that strengthens confidence in shared vulnerabilities such as epigenetic reactivation and refines hypotheses about lineage-related mechanisms. Although some of these agents have shown variable efficacy in the literature, others remain untested in CC models, offering new opportunities for exploration. Our results narrow the landscape to FDA-approved compounds with well-characterized safety, pharmacokinetic, and clinical profiles, which facilitates translational progress [22]. Nevertheless, evaluating predicted agents that are not yet FDA-approved could uncover additional mechanisms or therapeutic opportunities beyond current pharmacological boundaries. Building on this foundation, rational combination strategies, for example, pairing HDAC inhibition with mevalonate pathway blockade or ER antagonism with proteasome inhibition, represent a logical next step, though their implementation must address the practical challenges of polypharmacology, including drug\u2013drug interactions, overlapping toxicities, and regimen optimization [27]. Altogether, our prioritized compounds and their underlying mechanisms provide a coherent framework that bridges computational discovery with future experimental strategies in cervical cancer models, offering a foundation for biologically grounded exploration in HPV-associated CC.\n\n## 4.1. Data and Cohort Definition\nAll analyses were conducted in R (v4.5.1) using octad (v1.9.0) and octad.db (v1.10.0) packages [40,79]. RNA-seq expression profiles were obtained from the OCTAD platform, which integrates uniformly Toil-processed RNA-seq data (HDF5 format) from TCGA and GTEx and the associated sample metadata (dataset EH7274), allowing for reliable cross-cohort comparisons (Figure 4). From the TCGA-CESC project, we selected 267 cervical carcinoma samples. HPV genotypes were assigned according to the annotations reported with the HPV-EM algorithm [42], and only mono-infected cases with high-risk types were considered. Therefore, samples were stratified into two phylogenetic clades: HPV clade A7 (n = 65; HPV 18, 39, 45, 59) and HPV clade A9 (n = 202; HPV 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, 58) [9]. The control group consisted of 13 normal cervical tissue samples, including 10 from GTEx and 3 adjacent normals from TCGA.\nTo evaluate the clinical comparability between HPV clades prior to transcriptomic analyses, contingency tables were constructed for FIGO stage and histological type [97,98,99], and differences in distribution were assessed using Fisher\u2019s exact test implemented in R.\n\n## 4.2. Differential Expression Analysis\nDifferential gene expression between tumors and controls was assessed separately for each clade group (HPV clade A7 and HPV clade A9) using three methods: edgeR, DESeq2, and limma-voom. In order to mitigate unwanted variation, RUVSeq was applied with k = 1 for edgeR and DESeq2, following OCTAD\u2019s default pipeline. Genes were considered significantly differentially expressed when |log2FC| \u2265 1 and FDR \u2264 0.01, based on the adjusted p-values returned by each method.\n\n## 4.3. Over-Representation Analysis\nTo explore the functional relevance of the consensus DEG signatures, we performed Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) using the clusterProfiler (v4.16.0) R package [100]. For each clade (HPV clade A7 and HPV clade A9), up- and downregulated genes were analyzed independently across the three gene ontology (GO) domains: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). ORA was conducted to capture all significant categories (p \u2264 0.05, q \u2264 0.20, BH-adjusted), and subsequently refined by collapsing redundant terms based on semantic similarity (cutoff = 0.25), yielding a simplified set of representative GO categories for each clade and regulation group.\n\n## 4.4. sRGES Calculation\nCandidate drugs were prioritized using summarized Reversal Gene Expression Scores (sRGES) implemented in the OCTAD framework [1]. This metric integrates differential expression (DE) signatures with cohort\u2013cell line similarity weights to estimate the ability of a compound to reverse disease-associated transcriptional profiles. Similarity between tumor cohorts (HPV clade A7 and HPV clade A9) and cancer cell lines was first assessed with the function computeCellLine using the octad.small reference set",
