  "abstract": "Drug repurposing constitutes a strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance, by using agents with known safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. Previous studies have implemented new fusidic acid (FA) front-loading-dose regimens, allowing higher serum levels than those achievable with ordinary doses. As susceptibility breakpoints are affected by serum level, we evaluated the repurposing of FA as an antimicrobial product against enterococci. FA minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against standard enterococci strains; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 27270 were 2 and 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The MIC against 98 enterococcal clinical isolates was\u2009\u2264\u20098\u00a0\u00b5g/mL; all would be susceptible if categorized according to recalculated breakpoints (\u2265\u200916\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), based on the serum level achieved using the front-loading regimen. FA administration in vivo, using the BALB/c mouse infection model, significantly reduced bacterial burden by two to three log10 units in the liver and spleen of mice infected with vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant strains. Exposure of the standard enterococcal strains to increasing, but not fixed, FA concentrations resulted in resistant strains (MIC\u2009=\u2009128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), with thicker cell walls and slower growth rates. Only one mutation (M651I) was detected in the fusA gene of the resistant strain derived from serial passage of E. faecium ATCC 27270, which was retained in the revertant strain after passage in the FA-free medium. In conclusion, FA can be repurposed as an antimicrobial drug against enterococci with a low probability of mutational resistance development, and can be employed for treatment of infections attributable to vancomycin-resistant enterococci.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nMultidrug-resistant enterococci are challenging nosocomial pathogens that have developed resistance to most antimicrobials in use. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci are classified by the World Health Organization as a high priority pathogen for research and development of new antibiotics (World Health Organization 2017) and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a serious threat. In addition, the CDC reported a 16% increase in the rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections since 2019, which may be attributed to the weakened immunity occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated higher hospitalization rates (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2022).\nDrug repurposing offers a fast, relatively inexpensive alternative to development of new antimicrobials by repositioning already-known agents alone or in combination with other antibiotics, with established safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles (Dubey et al. 2020).\nFusidic acid (FA) is a bacteriostatic agent that is used for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections; it acts through inhibition of protein synthesis by binding the elongation factor G-GDP (EF-G-GDP), preventing peptide translocation and disassembly of ribosomes (Fernandes 2016).\nEnterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are intrinsically resistant to FA (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2023; EUCAST 2022). However, new FA front-loading-dose regimens have been suggested (Bulitta et al. 2013; Fernandes 2016), and have succeeded in reaching high Cmax levels (140\u2013250\u00a0\u00b5g/mL). The achieved high plasma levels of FA decrease its clearance from the body and lessen the emergence of resistant strains during the treatment period (Kusanya et al. 2011; Tsuji et al. 2011; Bulitta et al. 2013).\nHere, we evaluated the repurposing of FA as an antimicrobial agent against enterococci, and whether its use will be accompanied by resistance development.\n\n## Bacterial strains and culture conditions\nBacterial strains used or developed in this study are described in Table\u00a01. In addition, 98 clinical enterococcal isolates from the archive of the Microbiology and Immunology department, Faculty of Pharmacy, British University in Egypt, were used in the study. The clinical isolates were randomly obtained from urine samples of patients with urinary tract infections; their antimicrobial susceptibility was unknown when retrieved for this study purpose. All strains were stored in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Oxoid, England) containing 25% glycerol at\u2009\u2212\u200980\u00a0\u00b0C (master seed lot). When required, samples from the master seed lot were cultured on BHI agar (Oxoid, England), at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h.\nTable 1Bacterial strains used in this studyStrainCharacteristicsSourceEnterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212Standard strainDr. Yomna HashemEnterococcus faecium ATCC 27270Standard strainDr. Samar MabroukE. faecalis strain-74Vancomycin-sensitiveBUE archiveE. faecalis strain-Y3Vancomycin-resistantBUE archiveE. faecalis cP15QE. faecalis ATCC 29212 passaged in 0.25 of the FA MIC1Current studyE. faecalis cP15HE. faecalis ATCC 29212 passaged in 0.5 of FA MIC1Current studyE. faecalis cP15QfE. faecalis cP15Q passaged in FA-free MHB2Current studyE. faecalis cP15HfE. faecalis cP15H passaged in FA-free MHB2Current studyE. faecalis iP15E. faecalis ATCC 29212 passaged in increasing concentrations of FA1Current studyE. faecalis iP15fE. faecalis iP15 passaged in FA-free MHB2Current studyE. faecium cP15QE. faecium ATCC 27270 passaged in 0.25 of FA MIC1Current studyE. faecium cP15HE. faecium ATCC 27270 passaged in 0.5 of FA MIC1Current studyE. faecium cP15QfE. faecium cP15Q passaged in FA-free MHB2Current studyE. faecium cP15HfE. faecium cP15H passaged in FA-free MHB2Current studyE. faecium iP15E. faecium ATCC 27270 passaged in increasing concentrations of FA1Current studyE. faecium iP15fE. faecium iP15 passaged in FA-free MHB2Current studyBUE British University in Egypt, FA fusidic acid, MHB Muller Hinton broth, MIC minimum inhibitory concentration1Passaged serially during 15\u00a0days2Passaged consecutively for 10\u00a0days\n\n## Identification of clinical enterococci\nClinical enterococcal isolates were identified to species level by PCR targeting the d-alanine-d-alanine ligase (ddl) gene according to Dutka-Malen et al. (1995).\n\n## Determination of FA minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of FA against the enterococcal standard strains (E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and E. faecium ATCC 27270), as well as the clinical isolates, was determined using broth microdilution according to CLSI guidelines (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2018). FA was prepared as a stock solution; different dilutions were made in Muller-Hinton (MH) broth to achieve a concentration range from 128 to 0.25\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Inoculated and uninoculated MH broth were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The experiment was done in triplicate.\nThe minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined as described by Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2022) for the standard enterococci. At the end of the incubation period of MIC plates, 100 \u03bcL of the wells showing no visible growth were inoculated onto BHI agar followed by incubation overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The MBC corresponds to the minimum concentration of FA reducing the initial inoculum (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105\u00a0CFU/mL) by\u2009>\u200999.99% (absence of visible colonies on the agar surface). The experiment was done in triplicate.\n\n## Calculation of estimated FA susceptibility breakpoint\nThe FA susceptibility breakpoint was estimated in a trial to determine whether the elevated Cmax recorded previously when applying the front-loading dose (two front loading doses of 1650\u00a0mg every 12\u00a0h followed by 13 doses of 825\u00a0mg every 12\u00a0h) compared to that recorded when using the ordinary dose regimen (500\u00a0mg of oral FA) would theoretically affect the FA breakpoint. The simple equation previously adopted by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) for breakpoint calculation [(Cmax/et)\u2009\u00d7\u2009fs] was used where Cmax is the maximum serum concentration after administering a stated dose at steady state, f is a protein binding factor, t is the half-life of serum elimination, e is the minimal Cmax:MIC ratio (usually 4), and s is the reproducibility. In the case of FA, f was 0.2, t was 0.5, and s was 0.5 or, better, 1 (MacGowan and Wise 2001). When using the ordinary dose regimen (500\u00a0mg of oral FA), the Cmax was about 30\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, while the Cmax was 157 and 256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, after the last loading and maintenance doses, respectively, using the front-loading-dose regimen (Bulitta et al. 2013; Fernandes 2016).\n\n## Determination of the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern\nThe susceptibility of the clinical enterococcal isolates to different antimicrobials was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2015). The following antibiotics were tested: chloramphenicol (30\u00a0\u03bcg), minocycline (30\u00a0\u03bcg), vancomycin (30\u00a0\u03bcg), ciprofloxacin (5\u00a0\u03bcg), fosfomycin (200\u00a0\u03bcg with 50\u00a0\u03bcg glucose 6-phosphate), nitrofurantoin (300\u00a0\u03bcg), and linezolid (10\u00a0\u03bcg). All antibiotic discs were from Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK, except the fosfomycin discs which were from Mast Co., Merseyside, UK. The plates were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h, the inhibition zone diameters were measured, and the results interpreted according to CLSI guidelines (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2023b). E. faecalis ATCC 29212 was used as a control strain.\n\n## In silico\u00a0detectability of transmissible FA resistance genes in enterococcal genomes \nThe detectability of transmissible genes responsible for FA resistance (fusB, fusC, fusD) was determined in the genomes of E. faecalis (n \u2248 3000) and E. faecium (n \u2248 5000) publicly available in the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) database and in all available genomes within the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomes were searched for the presence of annotated fusB, fusC, or fusD genes. Detectability of gene sequences of fusB (accession number NG_047900.1), fusC (accession number NG_050413.1), and fusD (accession number NG_050585.1) in the genomes of the tested Enterococcus spp. also was evaluated using the blastn tool in the PATRIC and NCBI databases.\n\n## In vivo\u00a0evaluation of the FA efficiency in the protection against \nThe in vivo infection model was performed using female BALB/c mice aged 6\u20138\u00a0weeks, weighing 18\u201322\u00a0g (obtained from Theodor Bilharz Research Institute, Giza, Egypt). Mice were housed at room temperature with an alternating 12\u00a0h light\u2013dark cycle, fed on standard food and water ad libitum. They were allowed to acclimatize for four days before the start of the experiment, and were observed to exclude any local or systemic diseases (Yin et al. 2015).\n\n## Establishment of FA dosing regimen\nAdministration of FA in mice is highly challenging due to its rapid metabolism and short half-life that leads to rapid clearance from the body (Garcia Chavez et al. 2021). To establish the treatment dose and administration route of FA, a pilot study was performed. Mice were divided into groups; each was injected with a different dose of sodium fusidate (375, 180, 90, 60, 45, 30\u00a0mg/kg body weight q8h) either by intraperitoneal or by subcutaneous routes (2 mice/dose in each group) and observed for 96\u00a0h for survival or any signs of illness. The maximum tolerated dose was used in the in vivo model.\n\nNeutropenia was induced in 30 female BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal administration of cyclophosphamide (GLS PHARMA Limited, New Delhi, Delhi, India) in volumes of 200 \u00b5L, at doses of 150\u00a0mg/kg and 100\u00a0mg/kg on days 1 and 4, respectively (Onyeji et al. 2000). On day 3, mice were divided into five groups each consisting of six mice: two positive control groups (group 1 and group 3), two FA-treatment groups (group 2 and group 4), and one negative control (group 5). The FA-treatment groups received 200 \u00b5L of 60\u00a0mg/kg body weight of sodium fusidate in sterile water (equivalent to 57.6\u00a0mg/kg body weight FA) intraperitoneally q8h. The positive control groups were administered sterile water instead of sodium fusidate. A negative control group was injected with 200 \u00b5L of sterile water intraperitoneally. FA administration continued till the end of the experiment. On day 5, infection was performed by E. faecalis strain-74 (vancomycin-susceptible strain) and E. faecalis strain-Y3 (vancomycin-resistant strain) by intraperitoneal administration of 109\u00a0CFU/mL of either strain suspended in 1\u00a0mL saline (Ali et al. 2019). Each strain was used to infect one positive control and one treatment group (Figure S1). The negative control group was administered 1\u00a0mL of sterile saline intraperitoneally.\nOn day 6 (one-day post-infection), all mice were anaesthetized with an overdose of sodium thiopental and then decapitated. The liver and spleen were aseptically dissected and homogenized in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The viable bacterial count in the dissected organs was determined by tenfold serial dilution of the organ homogenates in phosphate-buffered saline and spotting 10 \u00b5L of the undiluted homogenates and of each dilution on the surface of bile esculin azide agar (Biokar Diagnostics, Allonne, Oise, France). Plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and the enterococcal colonies counted at the end of the incubation period (Zhang et al. 2023).\n\n## Evaluation of possible resistance development to FA\nPossible resistance development by repeated exposure to FA was tested by passage of the tested strains (E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and E. faecium ATCC 27270) in fixed (0.25 and 0.5 of the MIC) and increasing (1 to 256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) FA concentrations for 15\u00a0days, followed by passage in a FA-free medium for 10\u00a0days (Navarro et al. 2019; Ibrahim et al. 2023). The inoculum was prepared by adjusting the optical density (OD) of the overnight bacterial culture in MH broth to 0.5 McFarland unit. The OD-adjusted culture was diluted 1:150 with fresh MH broth (\u2248 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u00a0CFU/mL). The diluted bacterial culture (1\u00a0mL) was mixed with 1\u00a0mL of FA-containing MH broth to reach the desired FA concentration and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. After incubation, the resulting culture was adjusted to an OD equivalent to 0.5 McFarland unit, diluted, and mixed with FA-containing broth as described earlier. In case of passage with increasing FA concentrations, the culture from the well with the highest FA concentration showing visible bacterial growth was used. Passage was repeated daily for 15 consecutive days. After the 15th passage, the resulting cultures were isolated on bile esculin azide agar, and their MIC was determined in triplicate by broth microdilution. During each passage, inoculation of the same strain in a FA-free MH broth was used as a positive control. Uninoculated MH broth was used as a negative control.\nThe resulting strains, after the 15th passage, were subjected to ten consecutive passages in FA-free MH broth. The obtained cultures after the 10th passage were isolated and their MICs were determined as described previously. The resulting strains are described in Table\u00a01.\n\n## Evaluation of potential resistance mechanisms in the developed resistant strains\nPhenotypic and genotypic changes associated with emergence of FA resistance were compared in the parent strains (E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and E. faecium ATCC 27270), the resistant strains obtained after passage in increasing FA concentrations (E. faecalis iP15 and E. faecium iP15), and the revertant strains after passage in FA-free MH broth (E. faecalis iP15f and E. faecium iP15f).\n\n## Growth pattern determination\nIsolated colonies of the tested strains on BHI agar were inoculated into 5\u00a0mL BHI broth and incubated overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with shaking at 180\u00a0rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted with BHI broth to reach an OD of 1 at 600\u00a0nm, followed by 1/100 dilution in BHI broth. The diluted cultures were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with shaking at 180\u00a0rpm and the OD of the incubated cultures at 600\u00a0nm was measured hourly for 10\u00a0h then after 24\u00a0h (Tag ElDein et al. 2021). The growth rates were determined according to Tsuchiya and colleagues (Tsuchiya et al. 2018). The experiment was done in triplicate.\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility to different antibiotics\nThe antimicrobial susceptibility was determined as described previously by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method.\n\n## Measurement of cell wall thickness\nThe thickness of the cell wall of the tested strains was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\u00a0in the TEM laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, Cairo University Research Park, Giza, Egypt. The tested strains were grown overnight in BHI broth at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 180\u00a0rpm and the resulting cultures diluted as described under growth pattern determination. The diluted culture was incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 180\u00a0rpm until reaching mid-log phase (OD600 \u2248 0.8\u20131). Cultures were centrifuged at 6037\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 5\u00a0min and the pellets were fixed, stained, and scanned by TEM (Nakamura et al. 2021). For each sample, 5 cells were examined by measuring the cell wall thickness at three different locations of each cell.\n\n## Primer design\nPossible mutations in fusA and fusE genes encoding EF-G and ribosomal protein L6 (a contact area for EF-G), respectively, were determined in resistant and revertant strains and compared to those genes in the parent strains. The nucleotide sequences of fusA and fusE genes and their flanking regions in E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (accession number CP008816.1) were downloaded from the NCBI and the primers were designed to amplify the complete sequence of each gene: FusA-F1 (5\u2032 GGCAGCAGAAAGTCAATT3\u2032) and FusA-Rv1 (5\u2032ATCATCATAAGCTATTTTACACGAA3 \u2032) for fusA, and FusE-F1 (5\u2032 CTGACAAAGAAGCTAGAGC3\u2032) and FusE-Rv1 (5\u2032 TGCTTGTTGTTGACTTCTG 3\u2032) for fusE.\nThe nucleotide sequences of fusA and fusE genes of E. faecium ATCC 27270 were not available in the NCBI database at the time of experiment; so the nucleotide sequences of the aforementioned genes in different E. faecium strains (n\u2009=\u20099) were downloaded from the NCBI (Table S1) and aligned using Multiple Sequence Alignment (Clustal Omega) tools (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Primers were designed in the conserved regions flanking each gene: FusA-F3 (5\u2032 GACCTCAGATAGTGTCCTTAT3\u2032) and FusA-Rv2 (5\u2032ACCACATGCCCATATCATC3 \u2032) for fusA, and FusE-F2 (5\u2032 CTGATAAAGAAGCTCGTGA3\u2032) and FusE-Rv2 (5\u2032 AGGTAAACTTCAGCCAAATG 3\u2032) for fusE.\nAdditional primers FusA-F2 (5\u2032 TCACTGGAATCATTGACTTG3\u2032) and fusA-F4 (5\u2032 CACAGGAATTATCGACCTTG3\u2032) were designed to be used during the sequencing of fusA genes from E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively (fusA gene lengths\u2009=\u20092082 and 2088\u00a0bp). All primers were manufactured by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea).\n\n## Amplification of target genes\nDNA was extracted from the tested strains using the boiling method (Queipo-Ortu\u00f1o et al. 2008). For resistant strains, we failed to extract the DNA by the boiling method; the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nAmplification of the target genes was performed using PCR in a 50-\u00b5L reaction volume containing 10 \u00b5L of extracted DNA (2 \u00b5L of DNA in case of E. faecalis iP15 and E. faecium iP15 strains), 10 \u00b5L colorless GoTaq\u00ae Flexi Buffer (5\u2009\u00d7) (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA), 2\u00a0mM magnesium chloride (Promega), 0.2\u00a0mM each of nucleotide mix (Promega), 1.25 U GoTaq\u00ae DNA Polymerase (Promega), and 30\u00a0pmol of each of the forward and reverse primers. The reaction included an initial denaturation step at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation for 30\u00a0s at 95\u00a0\u00b0C, annealing for 30\u00a0s at 52\u00a0\u00b0C, and extension for 3\u00a0min at 72\u00a0\u00b0C, with a final extension step at 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min.\n\n## Sequencing of amplified genes\nThe amplified gene products were purified using FavoPrep\u2122 Gel/PCR Purification Mini Kit (Favorgen Biotech Corp., National Biotechnology Park, Ping Tung, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. The purified products were sequenced by Macrogen Inc. using the standard Sanger sequencing method. Two forward primers and the reverse primer were used for sequencing the fusA gene (FusA-F1, FusA-F2, and FusA-Rv1 for E. faecalis strains; FusA-F3, FusA-F4, and FusA-Rv2 for E. faecium strains). For fusE gene sequencing, the forward primers were used. The obtained sequences of the fusA gene (3 contigs, each contig \u2248 700\u00a0bp) were assembled manually. fusA and fusE gene sequences were translated using the ExPASy translation tool (https://web.expasy.org/translate/) and aligned using Multiple Sequence Alignment (Clustal Omega) tools (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) to detect possible mutations in the translated peptide sequences.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA). All experiments were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. Student\u2019s t-test with Welch\u2019s correction was used to compare the difference in the bacterial load in treatment and control groups. One-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc multiple comparison test was used to assess the difference in cell wall thickness measured by TEM and the growth rate. In addition, two-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc multiple comparison test was used to compare the OD of bacterial cultures at different time points. In all cases, p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the clinical isolates\nThe clinical enterococcal isolates were identified to species level by PCR targeting the ddl gene. Only seven isolates were E. faecium, while the remaining isolates (n\u2009=\u200991) were E. faecalis. All enterococcal isolates were susceptible to linezolid and nitrofurantoin, and most were susceptible to fosfomycin (98.9%) and vancomycin (97.9%). About half of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (55.1%) and chloramphenicol (53%), while only 6.2% were susceptible to minocycline.\n\n## FA susceptibility in different strains\nThe MIC of FA against E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and E. faecium ATCC 27270 was 2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The MBC values for both strains were 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Most of the clinical isolates (66/98, 67%) had FA MICs of 2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL; the remaining isolates had a MIC between 0.5 and 8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, yielding an MIC90 of 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. The results of typing, susceptibility to different antimicrobials, and FA MIC of each isolate are given in Table S2.\nThe estimated FA breakpoint, calculated according to Cmax obtained using the ordinary dose regimen, was 1.5 or 3\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, depending on the s value used. Calculated FA breakpoints, according to the Cmax obtained with the front-loading dose regimen, were between 7.85 and 15.7, and between 12.8 and 25.6\u00a0\u00b5g/mL using the recorded Cmax after the last loading and maintenance doses (\u2265\u20098 and\u2009\u2265\u200916\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively). The MIC recorded for E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and E. faecium ATCC 27270, as well as all the clinical isolates tested here, will be less than the estimated breakpoint (can be clinically susceptible to FA using the front-loading-dose regimen). Only two clinical isolates (2%) would be classified as resistant according to the estimated breakpoint using the recorded Cmax after the second dose; these two isolates would be categorized as susceptible if the Cmax value obtained after subsequent doses were applied.\n\n## Transmissible FA resistance in enterococci\nNo transmissible FA resistance genes (fusB, fusC, or FusD), were detectable in the publicly available genomes of E. faecalis or E. faecium.\n\n## In vivo\u00a0efficiency of FA in the protection against \nThe in vivo efficiency of FA to protect against enterococcal infection was evaluated in a mouse model. A pilot study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and route of administration of FA indicated that intraperitoneal administration of 60\u00a0mg/kg body weight q8h was well-tolerated. Administration of sodium fusidate significantly reduced bacterial colonization by two to three log10 units in the liver and spleen of mice infected with either vancomycin-sensitive or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (p\u2009<\u20090.001; Fig.\u00a01).Fig. 1Efficiency of fusidic acid to protect against Enterococcus faecalis infection. The viable microbial counts of vancomycin-sensitive E. faecalis (VSE) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE) retrieved from the liver and spleen of fusidic acid\u2013treated mice were lower by 2\u20133 log10 units compared to those of untreated (positive control) mice.

All the resulting strains (E. faecalis cP15Q, E. faecalis cP15H, E. faecium cP15Q, and E. faecium cP15H) by the fifteenth passage had a FA MIC of 8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Subsequent passage of the resultant strains in FA-free MH broth reduced the MIC in E. faecalis cP15Qf, E. faecalis cP15Hf, and E. faecium cP15Qf to 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL; E. faecium cP15Hf that had been exposed to 0.5 MIC of FA retained its MIC of 8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (Fig.\u00a02a, b).Fig. 2Resistance development to fusidic acid by repeated exposure. a The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, the resultant strains (E. faecalis cP15Q, E. faecalis cP15H) after exposure to fixed fusidic acid concentrations (0.25 and 0.5 of the MIC, respectively) for 15\u00a0days, and the recovered strains after passage in fusidic acid\u2013free Muller\u2014Hinton (MH) broth for 10\u00a0days (E. faecalis cP15Qf, E. faecalis cP15Hf, respectively); b the MIC of Enterococcus faecium ATCC 27270, the resultant stains (E. faecium cP15Q, E. faecium cP15H) after exposure to fixed fusidic acid concentrations (0.25 and 0.5 of the MIC) for 15\u00a0days, and the recovered strains after subsequent passage in fusidic acid\u2013free MH broth for 10\u00a0days (E. faecium cP15Qf, E. faecium cP15Hf, respectively); c the MIC of E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecium ATCC 27270, the resultant strains after passage in increasing concentrations of fusidic acid for 15\u00a0days (E. faecalis iP15 and E. faecium iP15, respectively), and the revertant strains after subsequent passage in fusidic acid\u2013free MH broth for 10\u00a0days (E. faecalis iP15f and E. faecium iP15f)\nExposure of E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and E. faecium ATCC 27270 to increasing concentrations of FA during 15 serial passages resulted in emergence of strains with a MIC of 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (E. faecalis iP15 and E. faecium iP15). Serial passage of these resistant strains in FA-free medium for 10\u00a0days reduced the MIC of the revertant strains (E. faecalis iP15f and E. faecium iP15f) to 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (Fig.\u00a02c).\n\n## Growth patterns of the developed strains\nThe resistant strains exhibited slower growth compared to the parent and the revertant strains (Fig.\u00a03a), during the exponential growth phase. The OD600 of the cultures was compared at different time points, where the resistant E. faecalis iP15 had significantly reduced growth during the period from 2 to 10\u00a0h and reached a similar OD after 24\u00a0h of incubation, compared to the parent E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and the revertant E. faecalis iP15f (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a03b). Similarly, the resistant E. faecium iP15 showed a significantly reduced growth between 3 and 10\u00a0h of incubation and recorded similar growth after 24\u00a0h of incubation, compared to the parent E. faecium ATCC 27270 and the revertant E. faecium iP15f (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a03c). The growth rate of the resistant strains (E. faecalis iP15 and E. faecium iP15) were significantly lower than those of the parent strains (E. faecalis ATCC 29212 and E. faecium ATCC 27270; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and the revertant strains (E. faecalis iP15f and E. faecium iP15f; p\u2009<\u20090.05) as indicated in Table\u00a02.Fig. 3Growth patterns of the parent, resistant, and revertant strains. a Growth patterns of the parental Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 27270, resultant resistant strains after exposure to increasing fusidic acid concentrations (E. faecalis iP15, E. faecium iP15), and revertant strains after passage of the resistant strains in fusidic acid\u2013free medium (E. faecalis iP15f, E. faecium iP15f).
