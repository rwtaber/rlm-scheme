  "abstract": "The outbreak of a fatal black fungus infection after the resurgence of the cadaverous COVID-19 has exhorted scientists worldwide to develop a nutshell by repurposing or designing new formulations to address the crisis. Patients expressing COVID-19 are more susceptible to Mucormycosis (MCR) and thus fall easy prey to decease accounting for this global threat. Their mortality rates range around 32-70% depending on the organs affected and grow even higher despite the treatment. The many contemporary recommendations strongly advise using liposomal amphotericin B and surgery as first-line therapy whenever practicable. MCR is a dangerous infection that requires an antifungal drug administration on appropriate prescription, typically one of the following: Amphotericin B, Posaconazole, or Isavuconazole since the fungi that cause MCR are resistant to other medications like fluconazole, voriconazole, and echinocandins. Amphotericin B and Posaconazole are administered through veins (intravenously), and isavuconazole by mouth (orally). From last several years so many compounds are developed against invasive fungal disease but only few of them are able to induce effective treatment against the micorals. Adjuvant medicines, more particularly, are difficult to assess without prospective randomized controlled investigations, which are challenging to conduct given the lower incidence and higher mortality from Mucormycosis. The present analysis provides insight into pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, underlying fungal virulence, and growth mechanisms. In addition, current therapy for MCR in Post Covid-19 individuals includes conventional and novel nano-based advanced management systems for procuring against deadly fungal infection. The study urges involving nanomedicine to prevent fungal growth at the commencement of infection, delay the progression, and mitigate fatality risk.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nMucormycosis (MCR) is one of the \u201copportunistic\u201d fungi belonging to the zygomycete family (1, 2). The leading cause of infection is inhaling spores, which can spread to immune-compromised individuals\u2019 paranasal sinuses and lungs, eventually resulting in rhino-cerebral disease - a primary type of mycosis in post-COVID-19 infection cases (3\u20135). MCR is non-pathological in the immune-competent population due to intact immunity via neutrophils. In contrast, it can cause severe invasive fungal infections in immune-compromised patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), wound injury (6), HIV/AIDS, cancer, and organ transplant (7, 8). Moreover, this \u201copportunistic\u201d fungus can be clinically classified as cutaneous, disseminated, pulmonary, rhino-orbital, or gastrointestinal and is comprehended to cause renal infections, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and peritonitis (9). Several published reports indicated that the risk factors for mycosis include immune suppression (10), DKA, DM, and corticosteroid administration (7\u20139, 11).\nNanotechnology provides an exceptional opportunity for medicines to improve their efficacy and delivery prospects (12). The pharmaceutical nanotechnology utilizes various delivery systems or carriers, i.e., nanoliposomes, nanocrystals, nanoemulsions, lipid nanocarriers, polymeric microspheres, nanosuspensions, dendrimers, poly(prodrug) amphiphile, cross-linked and smart hydrogel, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)-tailored nanoparticles (NPs), site-specific nanocarriers, etc. to enhance the effectiveness of various conventional therapeutics or drug molecules in the modern era of diseases (13, 14). Nanotechnology implies the construction or encapsulation of low dosages of potent therapeutics in targeted organs and tissues with minimal or non-significant side effects (12). Various empirical investigations have shown that NPs penetrate the microbial cells, causing impairment or lysis. In addition, NPs can cause structural modifications in the cell membrane by forming pits on the microbial cell surface, accumulating nanoparticles in the microbial cells. These events resulted in changes in cell permeability and resulted in apoptosis. The free radicals also induce cell damage after the exposure of fungal cells to nanoparticles; protein and sugar content are significantly decreased, which disrupts the fungal hyphae (15\u201317). Various investigations revealed the probable mechanisms of metal oxide nanoparticles for antifungal activity. In general, nanoparticles release ions that bind to specific protein groups found in microbes, thus disrupting integral membrane proteins and interfering with cell permeability (18, 19). Additionally, NPs can prevent the germination of conidia and hinder their development. The existence of microbes interfered with the oxidative electron transport of proteins, while the nanoparticles increased gene transcription levels in response to oxidative stress, ultimately affecting the mitochondrial membrane. Different types of NPs can further trigger specific oxidation reactions, damaging proteins, DNA, and membranes and interfering with nutrient absorption via microbes (20\u201323).\nTherefore, this review aims to disseminate information on pathogenesis, virulence traits, and novel treatment approaches for MCR in post-COVID-19. This co-occurring article also summarizes clinical manifestations and statistics of infected patients for MCR, especially in the COVID-19 era, and further recapitulates the overview of the article in \nFigure\u00a01\n. It also covered the novel nanomedicines and the futuristic scopes for adequate managing invasive infections. The instantaneous medical attention is required if a patient suffers from painful lungs, sinuses, skin abrasion, or suspected infection. During diagnosis, the healthcare practitioners must consider the patient\u2019s medical history, current bothersome symptoms, and laboratory testing.\n\n## Phyla of pathogenic causative fungi\nThe MCR in post-COVID-19 is a rare infection and highly prevalent in natural disaster-prone areas (24, 25). Worldwide, 1.7 per 100,000 people have been infected by this disease (26), while in India, it has been about 80 times more rampant than in Western countries (24). Several countries have reported MCR as a comorbidity associated with COVID-19. The condition is often called \u201cblack fungus\u201d since fungi-infested tissue appears black (27). Various fungi DNA have been encountered in numerous substrates, i.e., spacecraft, soil, wood, water, manure, decaying fruits, and vegetables (24, 26). Mucorales fungi (7, 28) are distinguished by filamentous hyphae that produce airborne fungal spores known as conidia, further aid in the propagation of the fungal species (29, 30). Zygomycota, the causative agent of MCR, is now classified in a new phylum, Glomeromycota, the order Mucorales falls under the subdivision mucoromycotina (1). After Aspergillus, this fungus has emerged as one of the most problematic pathogens in recent years, causing invasive diseases in patients with new coronavirus infections and diabetes (31\u201333). The infection known as MCR is a result of fungi belonging to the Mucorales order. Apophysomyces, a different family member that thrives in tropical and subtropical climes, is also widespread in India. About 70% of the cases are driven by Rhizopus oryzae, a significant cause of MCR, a severe and often life-threatening fungal infection. However, it is necessary to elucidate that while Rhizopus oryzae is a commonly associated organism with MCR, it might not be accurate to label it as the \u201cmost fundamental organism causing fungal infections.\u201d The prevalence of different causative agents for MCR might vary based on geographic location, patient population, and other factors. While Rhizopus oryzae might be responsible for a significant portion of MCR cases, other fungi within the Zygomycetes class can also cause these infections. Many different types of fungal infections are caused by a wide range of fungal species, each with varying levels of severity and clinical significance (34, 35). The different species of fungal phyla, pathogenic to humans, causing MCR are tabulated in \nTable\u00a01\n. The review suggests that the novel formulations discussed against MCR can be tested against these fungal pathogens listed in the \nTable\u00a01\n.\n\n## Pathogenesis of mucormycosis\nIn early 1876, a cancer patient in Germany was diagnosed with hemorrhagic pulmonary infarction, confirmed to be caused by sporangia and fungal hyphae, marking the first recorded case of MCR (36). The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that MCR is significantly more prevalent in India than in other parts of the world, with estimated rates ranging from 0.02 to 9.5 cases per 100,000 individuals. However, due to a lack of population-based data, it is challenging to determine the accurate incidence and prevalence of MCR in India (37). In a recent year, a computational model suggests that the number of cases of MCR in India is around 14 per 100,000 people (26, 38). The general population is vulnerable to evading fungal spores against host-defence mechanisms due to immunodeficiency and macrophage deductions (39), getting attached to host tissues and growing saprophytically. After infection, the fungus exhibits fungal dimorphism and proliferates uncontrollably under favorable conditions, making it difficult to control its growth and progression. Monoclonal antibodies are utilized to treat COVID-19; meanwhile, other therapies like tocilizumab, casirivimab, imdevimab, and regdanvimab lead to immune suppression, succumbing to the infected patients (40). The infection may further target the body\u2019s major organs, including the brain, lungs, and kidneys (41). Several clinical investigations further confirmed the involvement of eyes, skin, and sinuses, which are severely affected by this fatal infection, leading to significant symptoms or signs of swollen eyes, runny nose, hazy vision, and facial swelling (41).\nMCR or mucorales can lead to a severe complication called angioinvasion, resulting in arterial thrombosis (42). In general, the mucorales tend to evade breaking down the extracellular matrix proteins laminin and collagen IV. The invasion by the host is related to the secretion of enzymes, i.e., lipolytic, glycosidic, and proteases, including aspartic proteases. The expression of spore coat homologs (CotH) proteins binds to the host endothelial glucose-regulator protein 78 (GRP78), which further acts as a fungal ligand for this unique receptor. The expression of CotH and GRP78 induces fungal endocytosis in the host cell resulting in invasion and cellular damage (42, 43), as summarized in \nFigure\u00a02\n. An anti-GRP78 immune serum was found to protect mice with DKA from MCR, adding to the evidence of pathogenesis (7).\n\n## Risk factors for individuals prone to fungal disease\nThe susceptibility to COVID-19 varies among individuals and can be influenced by various factors, i.e., age, preexisting health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, and compromised immune system), genetics, and latent exposure to the virus (44, 45). Although anyone can contract COVID-19, the geriatric and individuals with underlying health issues are more susceptible to severe symptoms. There have been several reports of increased MCR cases among individuals recovering from COVID-19, particularly in India during the second wave of the pandemic. This has led to speculation that COVID-19 and its treatments might augment the risk of MCR (46). Various clinical representation also suggested the patients with DKA (47), immunocompromised, HIV/AIDS (2), organ transplantation (9), chemotherapy on corticosteroids (11), abraded tissues/necrosis, and wound-associated thrombosis are at risk for fungal infection. The MCR can occur or be seen within 2-3 weeks after recovering from COVID-19, especially in individuals with low counts of mono and poly-morphonuclear phagocytes (42). In a study, Ibrahim et\u00a0al. reported that generating oxidative metabolites and defensins (cationic peptide) leads to rapid induction of NF-\u03baB pathway-related genes via neutrophils in MCR (7). Recently, numerous cases of MCR in COVID-19 patients have been reported globally due to the increase in COVID-19 (approximately 3,50,000) cases daily. People with COVID-19 who have concomitant comorbidities, i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and immunosuppressive situations, including ventilation, corticosteroids, medication, and intensive care unit (ICU) patients, are more susceptible to life-threatening \u201copportunistic\u201d infections (48). Several patients with COVID-19 frequently witness a surge in MCR instances, primarily attributable to the increased usage of steroids (e.g., dexamethasone), particularly by diabetic patients. The overuse of steroid medication can worsen the condition caused by black fungus, even in low-risk patients. Many factors are involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, including susceptibility, illness severity, and outcomes. The SARS-CoV-2 infection spreading and critical cases were less among the children, which showed age disparities. The clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are less common in children, while older adults (>65 years) are more likely to experience severe complications and morbidities (49). The presence of multiple infectious diseases and susceptibility is based on the host genetic background, while a few of the genetic variants are also related to SARS-CoV-2 (50, 51). It has been observed that the high rate of COVID-19 pathogenesis and mortality found in obesity and type 2 diabetes individuals contributed to a high consumption rate of saturated fats, sugars, and carbohydrates, collectively called the Western diet (WD) (52). There was a higher rate of fatality found in patients with comorbidities in COVID-19, as reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control. In contrast, the fatality rate for the patients without comorbidities was around 0.9% (53). In another view, comorbidities-wise, the fatality rate was 7.3% in diabetes, 10.5% in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and 6.0% in hypertension (53). The risk of severe COVID-19 infection is nearly three times higher in obese individuals than in healthy population (54).\n\n## Mechanism of fungal infection associated with COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 virus infects the respiratory system, causing severe inflammation of the lung tissues, which may lead to death. To alleviate lung inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, doctors prescribe steroids and the antiviral drug Remdesivir\u00a9. However, the combination of steroids with Remdesivir\u00a9 has been encountered to be the leading cause of mycosis in COVID-19 patients (55). Various corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and methylprednisolone have been observed to reduce lung inflammation symptoms in critically ill COVID-19 patients by suppressing immune activity when administered orally or intravenously (11, 25). When exposed to unsanitary environmental conditions, airborne fungal spores take advantage of the patient\u2019s weakened immunity and potentially worsen the situation, causing fungal infections (29). The prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) patients combined with unhygienic practices, i.e., usage of contaminated, non-sterile medicinal drug applicators, surgical dressings, and adhesive tapes, have been reported as sources of primary cutaneous and other forms of mycosis, as summarized in \nFigure\u00a03\n. In addition, mycosis is more familiar among post-COVID-19 patients with co-morbidities, i.e., renal failure and autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatic fever (8). The individuals infected with COVID-19 often have lower levels of white blood cells (WBC) (56). However, in severe cases, there may be an increase in neutrophils, D-dimer, and urea levels, leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome. The activation of interleukins (IL-1\u03b2) by SARS-CoV-2 can trigger the production of other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. To reduce pulmonary inflammation, corticosteroids are typically administered to modulate cytokines, mainly interleukins (IL-1,4,6,8,12) and TNF-\u03b1 (55).\nAn uncontrolled immune response, \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 or cytokine release syndrome (CRS), has been documented in COVID-19 patients with an induced level of IL-6 and depleted lymphocyte level due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection (57). The anti-interleukin-6 therapy has been proposed to attenuate the CRS, further investigated using a mouse model to check the host\u2019s immunity against fungal pathogens (8). A higher lymphocyte count may be advantageous to the adaptive immune system and stimulate the formation of T cells specific for mucorales, which may aid in the control of invasive infection lymphopenia (58). Furthermore, COVID-19 virus causes long-term lymphopenia, which can increase the risk of transmitting invasive MCR (59).\n\n## Diabetes-related mycosis in elevated serum iron levels\nTypically, MCR begins in the nasal and paranasal sinuses after inhaling black fungal spores. The presence of preexisting diseases lowers an individual\u2019s resistance, making them potential hosts for invasive fungal infections, often seen in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (47). Mucorales fungi exhibit the capability to thrive in acidic environments via diminished chemotaxis and phagocytic ability. The compromised natural host cell response significantly contributes to the propagation of fungal infections within the system. In cases of MCR (Mucocutaneous Candidiasis and Reticuloendotheliosis) and diabetes, fungal infections primarily affect the rhino-orbital-cerebral region and the cutaneous and pulmonary areas. In diabetic patients, the invasive fungal infection shows significant aggressive signs, including facial pain and purulent nasal discharges (60, 61). Thus, the complications associated with diabetes related mycosis are challenging to address via conventional antiviral therapies (62). The patient with DKA has elevated serum iron levels in acidic conditions, influenced by transferrin, lactoferrin-binding proteins, and ferritin-binding proteins (10).\nKetoacidosis is a metabolic complication that can arise in individuals with diabetes, especially when diabetes is uncontrolled, or there is a lack of sufficient insulin levels. This condition is not directly associated with a transferrin binding defect or increased iron concentration in ketoacidosis patients. Several patients with ketoacidosis have elevated levels of ketone bodies, leading to the severe condition. This process is unrelated to capacitation induced by the keto-reductase enzyme. The enzyme keto reductase is not known to be generated by the pathogen Rhizopus oryzae or to cause any MCR-related issues. Ketoacidosis is primarily a result of the body\u2019s inability to properly use glucose for energy, leading to the breakdown of fats and the production of ketone bodies. Pathogens like Rhizopus oryzae are not associated with developing ketoacidosis in patients (63, 64). In addition, the excessive glycosylation caused by hyperglycemia lowers the iron affinity of transferrin (65). The iron chelation property of transferrin is impaired from that of the low pH condition in the blood vessels, an acidic condition induced by accumulated ketone bodies like \u03b2-hydroxy butyrate (BHB). In addition, Iron and BHB favor the growth of the fungus. The in vitro endothelium injury and the augmented fungal invasion happened from the expression of the GRP78 along with CotH. The infection\u2019s establishment is triggered by the host\u2019s iron acquisition. The patients on hemodialysis and receiving the siderophore deferoxamine as a part of the iron overload treatment are predisposed to disseminated MCR (7). The drug deferoxamine prevents iron overload toxicity by removing excess iron from the host (65). These developments help to explore the importance of host iron acquisition for the pathogenesis of MCR and its contribution to fungal growth during host cell invasion\u2014few of the research supported the significance of the serum iron levels in the MCR pathogenesis condition. The exploration of the liposomal amphotericin B and Deferasirox has demonstrated improved survival and reduced tissue fungal burden in the case of mice with DKA conditions. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved Deferasirox as an iron chelator and can be incorporated into a liposomal delivery system against MCR (10).\n\n## Statistics on COVID-19 mycosis in diabetic and steroid patients\nRecently, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India, has reported 28,000 active cases in India and declared a \u201cblack fungus epidemic\u201d (26). Of those cases, about 8% of the active cases had a diabetes background, while 14.9 % suffered from DKA. Additionally, the survey revealed that corticosteroid treatment was administered to approximately 86% of patients. The use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 treatment has been extensively studied, with evidence supporting their use in some instances. However, the treatment protocols for COVID-19 are evolving rapidly, and it is essential to consult the most recent guidelines and research for up-to-date information, as recommendations can change over time (66). In most circumstances, patients with severe or critical COVID-19, especially those experiencing respiratory distress or requiring mechanical ventilation, were usually prescribed corticosteroids. However, it was generally advised against administering them in mild cases or during the early stages of the disease as they could impede the body\u2019s natural ability to combat the virus. Dexamethasone, a type of corticosteroid, has demonstrated advantages in reducing mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation. The recommended dose was 6 mg once daily for up to 10 days (67). While dexamethasone was the most widely studied corticosteroid for COVID-19, other corticosteroids, i.e., prednisone and methylprednisolone, were also utilized in some instances. The choice of corticosteroids and dosage could vary based on the clinical situation and the latest guidelines. While beneficial in reducing inflammation, corticosteroids also have potential side effects, i.e., immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, and secondary infections. The use of corticosteroids is determined by evaluating individual cases and assessing potential risk factors and acquiescences (26, 68). In COVID-19 patients, the situation involves a scenario where 88.9% of cases experience sinus-related problems, while 56.7% encounter issues related to the rhino-orbital-cerebral region, where the mortality rate for these conditions was 30.7% (26). The opacification-related issues in the Sino maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were assessed in the many Computed tomography (CT) images of the face displaying mucosal thickening problems in COVID-19 patients (69). The pathogens that cause COVID-19-associated Mucormycosis (CAM) can withstand high temperatures and cause infection even in sterile conditions due to their thermotolerant characteristics. Numerous factors responsible for spreading the fungal disease in COVID-19 patients or survivors include endothelial damage, enhanced levels of ferritin, and multiplied levels of zinc and iron (69).\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 and MCR. The hyperglycemia at presentation (due to pre-existing DM or DKA) is the most critical risk factor observed in multiple cases (83.3%) of MCR with COVID-19, followed by cancer (26). The aberrant glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and various immunoregulatory proteins, i.e., the Fc gamma receptor, may impact the severity of COVID-19 disease (70). A history of diabetes and hyperglycemia are independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS (71). Hyperglycemia, and not simply diabetes, may increase glycosylation of these proteins and lead to more severe COVID-19 disease. Various clinical reports indicated that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, rather than just a history of DM, may play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 due to the binding of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 (70). The disease\u2019s clinical symptoms involve nasal obstruction, swelling around the eyes or cheeks, and the appearance of black spots on the affected body area. The SARS-CoV-2 triggers the biochemical response cascade in the patient\u2019s body, allowing fungal infection to thrive in an immunocompromised state (37, 72, 73). In addition, multiple studies have shown that COVID-19 infection can lead to invasive fungal disease by impairing the endothelial lining (73, 74). Recently, Bellanger and colleagues have proposed utilizing steroids as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2, potentially shaping its progression to resemble that of the suspected host. These developments also resulted in the growth of secondary fungal infections, which can lead to vision loss and hearing impairment, eventually resulting in mortality for COVID-19 patients (74). Thus, it is quintessential to investigate the cause along with the suggested treatment for the MCR to encounter the complications of the risk of COVID-related comorbidities (30).\nCastro GS et\u00a0al., have analyzed the MCR cases in patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 from May 2020 to May 2021 in a single centre in Western Mexico (75). Most of the patients had diabetes (a total of 5 patients out of six) and received corticosteroid therapy; from the selected group of patients, only three suffered from severe COVID-19. After the proper analysis, the study estimated that COVID-19-associated mucormycosis was 300 times more frequent among the COVID individuals in the selected study region. The strict type of glycaemic control and the use of corticosteroids in non-severe COVID-19 cases helped prevent complicated cases of fungal infection (75). In another study, Bhanuprasad et\u00a0al., explored the risk factors associated with the MCR COVID-19 pandemic into the second wave of infection (76). A total of 164 participants were assessed for risk factors, of which 132 cases belonged to MCR with COVID while 32 were non-COVID MCR. The later cases were treated as a control group for the study. The cohort study analyzed the impact of uncontrolled diabetes newly detected within a year. The alterations in the iron metabolism observed in COVID-MCR cases with the help of higher levels of serum ferritin and reduction into the C-reactive protein. Furthermore, researchers have extrapolated that interlinked risk factors like overuse of steroids and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus have a crucial impact on COVID-MCR cases, reasonable control of hyperglycemia, and appropriate use of steroids can be very beneficial for COVID-MCR prevention and further complications (76). In another work, the risk of hyperglycemia and steroid use on rhino-orbit-cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM) was studied by Ponnaiah M et\u00a0al., across India (77). They have compared many factors, including use of steroids, glycemic status, practices, and socio-demographics. Furthermore, the researchers have used a crude adjusted odds ratio involved with confidence intervals of around 95% through the logistic regression. A total of 267 cases have explored the associated risk of ROCM in post-COVID scenarios. The research group have concluded that hyperglycemic condition, irrespective of DM, along with the overuse of steroid, was crucial for the high risk of ROCM into COVID infection (77).\nThe steroid therapy is routinely used for the treatment of viral pneumonia. However, there is an event of patient\u2019s predisposition to secondary fungal and bacterial infections involving mortality and morbidity. The risk of invasive fungal infections like aspergillosis and MCR could be higher in patients with immune dysfunction, receiving corticosteroid therapy or suffering from severe viral pneumonia (78). The increasing risk event of MCR was found notably in patients with immunosuppression, hyperglycemic, or acquiring steroid therapy (78). According to a case study conducted in Germany by Seidel D et\u00a0al., a national survey was conducted to estimate the disease burden and clinical estimation of COVID-associated MCR cases (79). They assessed the clinical presentation of MCR related to COVID-19 in Germany with the help of German mycology networks and scientific societies. The research group also utilized the clinical information from the FunguScope\u00ae; a further study period was reported between March 2020 and June 2021, involving around 13 cases of MCR-COVID. Many factors, like an immunocompromised state owing to organ transplantation or malignancy, the diabetic condition, and the involvement of corticosteroid treatment, were involved in the selected study. The prevalence rate of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients was 0.67% and 0.58% in two selected study centres. The same is studied in intensive care units, and it was found to be 1.47%, 1.78% and 0.15% in three different study centres, thus provided evidence that the development and prevalence risk of MCR was higher in COVID-19 cases as compared to non-COVID cases (79).\n\n## Unique virulence traits of fungal pathogen\nTypically, fungal pathogens use different virulence strategies to infect and colonize their hosts successfully, evading the host\u2019s defences and causing damage. Different fungal pathogens may exhibit different combinations of these traits, and their virulence mechanisms can vary widely based on factors, i.e., host species, specific fungal species, and type of infection (80). The unique virulence traits of fungal pathogens iterate the importance of exploring the various virulence factors attributive to the infection (7). The general understanding of the mechanism of fungal attachment to its substrates, its physiological growth conditions in the host, and its mechanism of action is essential to devising drug formulations that can act against the fungal establishment in the host. Fungal pathogens first infect epithelial cells composed of the protein matrix, then gradually move towards endothelial cells, then reach the bloodstream and spread by hematogenous dissemination (81). The fungal sepsis can be induced due to fungi endocytosis into the host cell, while the endocytosis was accomplished with the help of spore coat homolog (CotH) protein. This later protein binds to the host endothelial receptor, namely GRP78 (82). Furthermore, Section 4.1 discusses the methodologies of virulence caused by high serum iron, ketone, and glucose levels.\nIn most instances, the disease is aggravated by the spread of fungal sporangia through the paranasal sinus to the orbital apex, causing endophthalmitis and loss of vision, ultimately resulting in rhino-cerebral damage (8), as illustrated in \nFigure\u00a04\n. In many cases of mycosis before the COVID-19 pandemic, studies showed increased serum iron levels at the infection site. An increased incidence of MCR is observed in individuals with immune suppression and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to the elevated serum iron levels in DKA patients contributing to the fungi\u2019s increased virulence (9, 10). Another significant factor that can increase virulence is fungal dimorphism, where the morphology of the fungus can change from a filament to a mold. The fungal dimorphism is influenced by factors such as temperature (83), the nutrient-rich micro-environment of the pathogen, and the host immune response (84). In most pathogenic fungi, i.e., P. brasiliensis, B. dermatitidis, H.capsulatum, S. schenckii, P. marneffei, and C. immitis of phylumAscomycota; C. neoformans, C. gatti of phylum Basidiomycota; filamentous morphology is found to exist at 20-25\u00b0C and yeast form occurs at 37\u00b0C (2).\nIn many cases, the pathogenicity in mould form could be attributed to the eukaryotic cell structure supporting virulence. The fungi P. brasiliensis, B. dermatitidis, H. capsulatum, and C. immitis exhibit dimorphism onset from m",
