Drug repurposing, wherein existing therapeutics are evaluated for new applications, offers a promising strategy to address this issue. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), initially developed for cancer therapy, have demonstrated antimicrobial activity against several gram-positive bacteria. This study investigates their activity in combination with colistin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. We focus on key ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens while incorporating additional bacterial strains to provide a comprehensive understanding of differential responses and potential dose-dependent synergistic effects. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using broth microdilution, while synergy was evaluated through checkerboard, time-kill, and growth kinetics assays. When combined with sub-inhibitory colistin, FTIs inhibited gram-negative bacterial growth. Tipifarnib exhibited more potent antimicrobial activity against gram-negative strains than lonafarnib. Peptidomimetic FTIs, B581 and FTI-277, inhibited gram-negative bacteria in combination with colistin but had no effect on the gram-positive strains tested. In contrast, alpha-hydroxy farnesyl phosphonic acid, an FPP analog, and bempedoic acid, targeting the mevalonate pathway, showed no antibacterial activity. In addition to their known inhibition of gram-positive bacteria, FTIs exhibited efficacy against gram-negative bacteria, including colistin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae, when combined with sub-inhibitory colistin. This might be due to a mechanism distinct from their eukaryotic targets, potentially involving the disruption of multiple biosynthetic pathways. Future studies will focus on elucidating these mechanisms of FTIs and exploring the therapeutic potential of FTI/colistin combinations against ESKAPE and other multidrug-resistant pathogens.",

  "full_text": "## Importance\nAntibiotic resistance is a growing threat to global health, necessitating innovative strategies to combat resistant pathogens. This study highlights the potential of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), originally developed for cancer therapy, as antimicrobials against key pathogenic bacteria. When combined with colistin, FTIs demonstrated significant activity against gram-negative bacteria. Notably, this combination enabled FTIs to exert antimicrobial activity even against colistin-resistant bacteria. Although the exact mechanism of action remains to be elucidated, this combination may offer a valuable therapeutic option against bacteria that have developed increased resistance to colistin, addressing a critical need in the treatment of multidrug-resistant pathogens.\n\n## Introduction\nThe emergence of antibiotic resistance is a steadily growing concern [1]. At the same time, research into novel antimicrobial agents is proving difficult and cost-intensive [2]. If current trends continue, it is estimated that antibiotic-resistant bacteria alone could cause over 10 million deaths per year by 2050 [3]. One way to at least partially address these problems is to test already established drugs of other medical areas for possible antimicrobial effects (drug repurposing). This was successfully conducted by using statins, which are lipid-modifying agents due to their competitive binding to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. One of the multiple pleiotropic properties also revealed antimicrobial potential in addition to its main effect [4].\nLikewise, we were able to show that inhibitors of farnesyltransferase (FTase), which are used as cancer therapeutics, also exhibit antimicrobial effects [5]. However, antimicrobial effects of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) have so far only been demonstrated in gram-positive bacteria (Fig 1A). Given that the outer membrane (OM) may limit the activity of FTIs, colistin, which binds to Lipid A in the lipopolysaccharide layer, thereby disrupting the OM\u2019s integrity and increasing its permeability, could serve as a means to expand their spectrum of activity to gram-negative bacteria [8,9].\nSimilar studies have already been conducted with other drugs. For example, Huang, Zhu [10] were able to show that increased intracellular accumulation of flavomycin can be achieved with simultaneous administration of sub-inhibitory colistin. This led to a significant reduction in the amount of colistin required to reduce the bacterial cell count. While these findings highlight the potential of combination therapies, the antimicrobial effects of FTIs have not been broadly explored across all ESKAPE pathogens in a combinational approach with colistin. The ESKAPE panel, consisting of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, represents a major global health threat due to their ability to \u201cescape\u201d the effects of many current antibiotics [11,12].These pathogens are not only responsible for a significant proportion of nosocomial infections but also exhibit a high prevalence of multidrug resistance, complicating treatment options [13]. Their virulence and adaptive mechanisms enable rapid genomic adaptation and resistance development, making it even more critical to discover new treatment options [14,15].\nIn addition to pathogenic bacteria, interactions with commensal bacterial species are relevant when assessing novel antimicrobial approaches. The balance of microbial communities, such as those in the gut or on the skin, plays a critical role in maintaining host physiology [16]. Disrupting this balance through antimicrobial interventions could potentially promote the overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens [17], highlighting the importance of understanding antimicrobial effects beyond traditional pathogenic targets.\nThe specific objectives of this study are as follows: (i) to evaluate the effects of the non-peptidomimetic FTIs, lonafarnib and tipifarnib, on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria when co-administered with colistin at sub-inhibitory concentrations; (ii) to assess the effects of the peptidomimetic FTIs, B581 and FTI-277, under similar conditions; and (iii) to investigate the impacts of alpha-hydroxy farnesyl phosphonic acid, a non-hydrolyzable analog of FPP, and (iv) bempedoic acid, an adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase inhibitor, under the same conditions, to better contextualize the effects of the aforementioned substances on bacterial behavior. Unlike the previously mentioned substances, which were primarily developed for the treatment of carcinomas, bempedoic acid is a lipid-lowering agent prescribed to a broader patient population. Notably, bempedoic acid and lonafarnib share the advantage of already being approved for clinical use [18,19], with bempedoic acid targeting the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway upstream of statins. Fig 1B provides an overview of these substances and their established eukaryotic targets. To achieve these aims, the checkerboard assay was employed to determine potential synergistic interactions. In addition, we extended the current checkerboard method by incorporating the viability agent resazurin and analyzing the results using fluorescence measurement. Moreover, dose-dependent interactions were systematically assessed, as illustrated in Fig 1C.\n\n## Chemicals\nColistin was purchased as colistin sulfate from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA). All additional reference antibiotics were purchased from Roth (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Bempedoic acid (ETC-1002, abbreviated as BPD in this study), FTI-277 (as FTI-277 HCl), lonafarnib and tipifarnib were all purchased from SelleckChem (SelleckChem, Munich, Germany). B581 was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Enzo Biochem, Inc., NY, USA), while alpha-hydroxy farnesyl phosphonic acid (\u03b1HFP) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Cayman Chemical, MI, USA). Colistin was dissolved in water and \u03b1HFP was dissolved in ethanol. All other substances were dissolved in DMSO.\n\n## Bacterial strains\nAll bacterial strains were purchased from Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. Table 1 lists all used strains alphabetically, giving further information such as the possible affiliation to the ESKAPE group.\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility testing\nBroth microdilution assay was used to determine minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each substance, following CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines [22]. For evaluation, resazurin (Sigma Aldrich) was used to indicate bacterial growth [23]. Resazurin is reduced to fluorescent resorufin by viable cells, likely via NADPH dehydrogenase [24]. An Infinite M Plex microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland) measured the fluorescence intensity (excitation at 540\u2009nm, emission at 590\u2009nm). Effective inhibition is assumed if the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) in all samples is reduced by more than 90% compared to the growth control at a certain concentration, in addition to the visible absence of growth. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined immediately after MIC values by plating 3 \u00b5l on agar plates without antibacterial agent. Mueller Hinton medium (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used throughout the experiments, as broth (MHB) or agar (MHA) with 18\u2009g/l agar. The medium was cation-adjusted [25].\n\n## Checkerboard assay\nIn order to evaluate the synergistic effects of the individual substances with colistin, a modified checkerboard assay was used, as described by Bellio, Fagnani [26]. Briefly, a 96-well microplate is divided into two equal parts. This allows two checkerboard assays to be tested on one plate. The dilution scheme and the procedure in general are shown in Fig 2A. Duplicate dilution series for colistin (ranging from 0.008 \u00b5g/ml to 0.5 \u00b5g/ml for all bacteria except E. cloacae, where concentrations ranged from 0.06 \u00b5g/ml to 4.0 \u00b5g/ml) and one of each of the other drugs tested (ranging from 7.8 \u00b5M to 125.0 \u00b5M) were mixed in cation-adjusted MHB. Each well contained 0.2\u2009ml of each antimicrobial combination or broth control. The final bacterial concentration after inoculation was 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml). Resazurin was used for the indication of bacterial growth, as described in the preceding section (Fig 2B).\nThe potential synergistic effect of two drugs was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) according to the following formula [10]:\nIn most studies where the checkerboard assay is used, the FICI cutoff to define synergy was set to < 0.5. A range between 0.5 and 1.0 was defined as additive, while 1.0 to 4.0 was interpreted as indifferent. Values of > 4.0 were considered antagonistic [27].\n\n## Growth kinetics\nTo determine the kinetics of bacterial growth, the optical density at 600\u2009nm (OD600) was measured continuously for 24 h at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 600\u2009rpm (SPECTROstarNano, BMG Labtech). For visualization, blank-corrected data derived from raw measurements were used. Growth kinetics contribute to understanding the functions of microbial cells and their behavior under different conditions, such as in response to antibiotics [28\u201330].\n\n## Time-kill assay\nTime-kill assays were conducted to evaluate the bactericidal kinetics and potential synergistic interactions of FTIs and colistin [31]. Bacterial suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland and diluted 1:200 in MHB to obtain an initial inoculum of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 CFU/ml. Cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 180\u2009rpm. At defined time points (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24\u2009h), samples were withdrawn, serially diluted in PBS, and 10 \u00b5l were spot plated onto MHA. CFU/ml were determined after overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. Bactericidal activity was defined as a\u2009\u2265\u20093 log10 CFU/ml reduction from the initial inoculum. Synergy was defined as a\u2009\u2265\u20092 log10 CFU/ml reduction compared to the most active single agent [32].\n\n## NPN uptake assay\nTo assess compound-induced changes in outer membrane permeability, N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN; Sigma-Aldrich) uptake assays were performed [33,34]. Briefly, bacteria were cultured to exponential phase (OD600 0.3\u20130.6), harvested, washed twice, and resuspended in assay buffer (5\u2009mM HEPES, 5\u2009mM glucose, pH 7.2) to OD600 1.0. 100 \u00b5l of cell suspension were mixed with 100 \u00b5l of assay buffer containing 20 \u00b5M NPN in black 96-well plates. Fluorescence (excitation 350\u2009nm, emission 420\u2009nm) was monitored every 30\u2009s over 10\u2009min at room temperature. NPN uptake was calculated using the following formula (Muheim et al., 2017), where Fobs is the observed fluorescence at a given compound concentration, Fcon is the fluorescence of NPN with cells plus solvent control, and FB is the fluorescence of NPN in the absence of cells. Data over 10 minutes was averaged.\n\n## Statistics\nData processing and statistical analysis were performed using Python 3.12.7 and SciPy 1.14.1 [35]. All data were obtained from at least three independent experiments and presented as means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD), unless otherwise noted. For growth kinetics, cubic spline interpolation was applied for data smoothing. For time-kill evaluation, statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. For NPN uptake analysis, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post hoc test was used to compare colistin-treated samples to the control. Significance is indicated as follows: p\u2009<\u20090.05 (*), p\u2009<\u20090.01 (**), p\u2009<\u20090.001 (***).\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility\nTo evaluate the FICI and classify the synergistic potential of drugs in combination with colistin, colistin was tested on all strains to determine its MIC (Table 2). In addition, we indicate clinical breakpoints and the\u00a0respective epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFF), as far as they are provided by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) [36]. Regular antibiotics were tested simultaneously as controls for antimicrobial susceptibility using resazurin as an indicator of cell viability (Fig 3A). Furthermore, gentamicin and vancomycin were tested on S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (Fig 3B). RFI values below 10% correspond in all cases with the absence of bacterial growth. All controls are listed in the supplementary files where additional technical information is provided (S1 File).\nThe tested bacterial strains show very diverse sensitivity profiles. In the case of gram-positive bacteria, the difference between S. aureus and MRSA is particularly pronounced. MRSA is resistant to the quantities of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and tetracycline selected in this study. The MRSA strain tested is also less sensitive to gentamicin, while there are no noticeable differences between S. aureus and MRSA with vancomycin. Among the gram-negative strains tested, A. baumannii and P. paraeruginosa are almost exclusively susceptible to colistin and not to the four control antibiotics.\n\n## Synergy assessment\nWhen farnesyltransferase inhibitors were combined with sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 \u00b5g/ml for all bacteria except E. cloacae, where concentrations ranged from 0.06 to 4.0 \u00b5g/ml, the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was inhibited. The effects of FTIs and colistin were very different in the ten bacterial strains tested. The complete data can be found in the supplementary files (S1\u2013S10 Figs).\nAmong the gram-negative strains, the non-peptidomimetic FTIs lonafarnib and tipifarnib notably reduced the MIC of colistin. For instance, in A. baumannii, the colistin MIC decreased from 1.0 \u00b5g/ml to 0.25 \u00b5g/ml (four-fold reduction) when 15.6 \u00b5M lonafarnib was applied. This effect was even more pronounced with tipifarnib; at 31.3 \u00b5M, the colistin MIC was reduced to 0.125 \u00b5g/ml (eight-fold reduction). These effects were comparable for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, though the K. pneumoniae strain exhibited a tendency to form subcolonies, particularly noticeable with lonafarnib treatment. Despite this, strong synergy (FICI\u2009<\u20090.5) was observed in some cases. In contrast, P. paraeruginosa largely lacked synergistic interactions, with only tipifarnib showing a slight additive effect. Lonafarnib, even at high concentrations combined with half the colistin MIC, exhibited minimal inhibitory activity against this strain. Conversely, in E. cloacae, lonafarnib displayed stronger synergistic effects than tipifarnib, reducing the colistin MIC from 32 \u00b5g/ml to 1.0 \u00b5g/ml (32-fold reduction) when 15.6 \u00b5M lonafarnib was used.\nIn comparison, the peptidomimetic FTIs, B581 and FTI-277, exhibited weaker effects on gram-negative bacteria. Additive and partial synergistic effects were observed but were less pronounced than those seen with lonafarnib and tipifarnib. For E. coli, FTI-277 reduced the colistin MIC to 0.125 \u00b5g/ml when 31.3 \u00b5M was applied. However, in K. pneumoniae, subcolonies reappeared, particularly with FTI-277, leading to inconsistent growth inhibition across replicates and complicating the evaluation of synergy. Similarly, both B581 and FTI-277 showed negligible effects on P. paraeruginosa and E. cloacae.\nFinally, \u03b1HFP and bempedoic acid exhibited no activity against the gram-negative bacteria tested. Fig 4 summarizes the results for the gram-negative strains, illustrating the investigated properties in relation to the inhibitory effects and identified synergistic activities.\nThe tested gram-positive bacteria differ significantly from the gram-negative strains. No effects of B581, FTI-277, \u03b1HFP, or BPD were observed in any of the gram-positive representatives. However, lonafarnib and tipifarnib exhibited strong inhibitory effects on MRSA, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis, independent of colistin. Thus, no synergistic effects were identified in these cases and colistin did not compromise the inhibitory effects of lonafarnib or tipifarnib on these bacterial strains.\nMRSA was inhibited at a lonafarnib concentration of 31.3 \u00b5M, whereas non-methicillin-resistant S. aureus showed inhibition at 15.6 \u00b5M. Similar MIC values were observed for tipifarnib against these strains; however, S. aureus exhibited inconsistent behavior with tipifarnib. At lower concentrations, tipifarnib partially reduced growth without achieving complete inhibition. Both lonafarnib and tipifarnib affected S. epidermidis similarly. Conversely, E. faecium showed no growth inhibition with either lonafarnib or tipifarnib when standard microdilution methods were applied. It is important to note that the E. faecium strain used in this study displayed an overall slow growth rate, which was further reflected in its generally low metabolic activity, as indicated by a slower reduction of resazurin.\nA unique case among the gram-positive bacteria was B. subtilis. This was the only gram-positive organism successfully inhibited by colistin (16 \u00b5g/mL) in this study. Furthermore, lonafarnib exhibited inhibitory effects on B. subtilis growth only in combination with colistin. A successful inhibition was observed with 31.3 \u00b5M lonafarnib and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL colistin, representing a 32-fold reduction in the required colistin concentration. Since colistin alone demonstrated activity against B. subtilis, an additive effect with tipifarnib and colistin is inferred. At a tipifarnib concentration of 15.6 \u00b5M, the colistin exhibited measurable effects. These findings are summarized in Fig 5.\nTo summarize the findings across all bacterial strains, the overall highest FICI values and fold changes in colistin MIC are presented as heatmaps in Fig 6. These data illustrate strain-specific variations in FTI/colistin interactions and colistin MIC reductions.\nLonafarnib and tipifarnib were the only FTIs that exhibited effects against gram-positive bacteria. However, synergistic effects (FICI\u2009<\u20090.5) were observed exclusively in B. subtilis, while E. faecium remained unaffected by any of the tested substances under the given conditions. In contrast, all tested FTIs inhibited gram-negative bacteria, with lonafarnib and tipifarnib demonstrating the highest FICI values in combination with colistin, particularly against E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae (FICI\u2009<\u20090.25). P. paraeruginosa was the least affected among the gram-negative strains (Fig 6A).\nWithin the gram-positive bacterial strains tested in this study, only B. subtilis exhibited a change in the required colistin MIC. A 32-fold reduction in the colistin concentration was observed when lonafarnib was administered concurrently. Although a certain additive effect was also observed with the simultaneous administration of colistin and tipifarnib, no fold change (FC) in colistin MIC was reported. This is because tipifarnib, at a concentration of 31.3 \u00b5M, inhibited the growth of B. subtilis independently of colistin. For gram-negative bacteria, FICI values strongly correlated with colistin MIC FCs. The most pronounced effect was observed in E. cloacae, where lonafarnib and tipifarnib both reduced the required colistin concentration from 32.0 \u00b5g/ml to 1.0 \u00b5g/ml, corresponding to a 32-fold reduction in colistin MIC in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, peptidomimetic FTIs failed to reduce the colistin MIC in E. cloacae. This was not the case for other gram-negative strains, where reductions were observed. Yet, K. pneumoniae was affected by B581 but not by FTI-277 (Fig 6B).\n\n## Growth kinetics and time-kill\nWhile the checkerboard assays explored the synergistic effects of FTIs and colistin across both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, growth kinetics experiments were conducted to gain deeper insights into the temporal dynamics of FTI activity, focusing specifically on S. aureus, a clinically significant gram-positive pathogen, and E cloacae, a colistin resistant strain. These experiments aimed to complement the endpoint-based MIC and FICI results by evaluating the consistency and duration of growth inhibition under dynamic conditions. To this end, S. aureus was tested with four concentrations of lonafarnib and tipifarnib, respectively, using continuous OD600 measurements over 24\u2009h at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 600\u2009rpm. These tests revealed slight deviations compared to standard CLSI-based methods. At a concentration of 7.8 \u00b5M lonafarnib, the growth of S. aureus was completely inhibited for the first 16\u2009h, after which rapid bacterial growth resumed (Fig 7A). Higher concentrations of 15.6 \u00b5M and 31.3 \u00b5M lonafarnib resulted in continuous growth inhibition throughout the 24-hour measurement period. A similar pattern was observed for tipifarnib: at 7.8 \u00b5M, minimal growth was detectable as a slight increase in OD600 after 12\u2009h (Fig 7C). Higher concentrations also led to sustained inhibition of growth. The observed differences may indicate an influence of shaking on the experimental outcomes, particularly regarding compound distribution in the medium.\nGrowth kinetics were similarly assessed for E cloacae. Unlike S. aureus, growth inhibition was not observed with lonafarnib or tipifarnib alone at concentrations up to 31.3 \u00b5M, or with sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin. However, clear growth suppression was observed in combination treatments with 4 \u00b5g/ml of colistin and 15.6 \u00b5M or 31.3 \u00b5M of lonafarnib, which maintained growth inhibition for the entire 24-hour measurement period. Even a concentration of 7.8 \u00b5M of lonafarnib combined with colistin resulted in a transient growth delay compared to colistin alone (Fig 7E). Tipifarnib/sub-inhibitory colistin had a similar effect on growth kinetics, albeit less pronounced. Growth was prevented over 24\u2009h at 31.3 \u00b5M tipifarnib plus 4 \u00b5g/ml colistin, while combinations at 15.6 \u00b5M caused a delayed onset of growth by about 10\u2009h (Fig 7G).\nTime-kill assays were conducted to gain more insights into the bactericidal kinetics of FTIs and colistin. Due to S. aureus\u2019s inherently slower growth rate compared to E. cloacae, measurable differences in bacterial counts emerged after 4\u2009h. By 8\u2009h, all tested concentrations of lonafarnib had resulted in a significant reduction of over 3 log10 CFU/ml compared to the DMSO control (p\u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig 7B). After 24\u2009h, this reduction remained significant across all concentrations, although the effect of 7.8 \u00b5M was notably less pronounced. A similar effect was observed for tipifarnib: while all tested concentrations demonstrated bactericidal activity, the highest concentration (31.3 \u00b5M) led to a reduction of approximately 7 log10 CFU/ml compared to the control (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). There was a statistically significant difference between the 31.3 \u00b5M and 15.6 \u00b5M concentrations of tipifarnib (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), indicating a concentration-dependent effect (Fig 7D).\nFor E. cloacae, the results for lonafarnib (Fig 7F) and tipifarnib (Fig. 7H) were highly comparable. Neither compound exhibited any bactericidal activity when used alone, with no reduction in CFU/ml relative to the DMSO control. Colistin, when applied at sub-inhibitory concentrations, induced a transient reduction in bacterial counts, most notably at the earliest time points. After 4\u2009h, treatment with colistin alone reduced bacterial load by approximately 5 log10 CFU/ml compared to the control (p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, this effect was not sustained; by 8\u2009h, the reduction no longer reached the\u2009\u2265\u20092 log10 CFU/ml threshold for bactericidal activity, and by 24\u2009h, CFU levels had returned to control levels. In contrast, the combined approach demonstrated clear synergy. When combined with sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin, both lonafarnib and tipifarnib resulted in a\u2009\u2265\u20093 log10 CFU/ml reduction compared to colistin alone, fulfilling the criterion for synergistic bactericidal activity. These differences were highly significant at the 2-hour time point for both combinations (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\n\n## Outer membrane permeability\nFocusing on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, permeability was assessed for E. cloacae and E. coli using the fluorescent dye NPN. This small molecule exhibits low fluorescence in an aqueous solution but becomes strongly fluorescent when it binds to phospholipids. Under normal conditions, uptake is limited and fluorescence remains low. However, when the OM is compromised, NPN can penetrate more easily. This results in increased fluorescence due to its interaction with membrane lipids [33]. The data were normalized to the highest tested colistin concentration (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009MIC).\nIn E. cloacae, all tested colistin concentrations \u2013 including sub-inhibitory levels down to 1/8 MIC \u2013 led to a highly significant increase in NPN uptake compared to the DMSO control (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 for all conditions). While the increased fluorescence at 1/2 MIC and 1/4 MIC could be partly explained by cell lysis, this is unlikely at 1/8 MIC, despite the NPN signal remaining significantly elevated (Figs 8A\u2013B). For E. coli, all tested concentrations \u2013 including sub-inhibitory levels \u2013 resulted in a statistically significant increase in NPN uptake compared to the DMSO control (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 to p\u2009=\u20090.0087) (Figs 8C\u2013D). These findings indicate that even sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin can increase outer membrane permeability in both species.\n\n## Discussion\nIn this study, the effects of different farnesyltransferase inhibitors in combination with colistin were investigated to identify potential synergistic effects and expand the spectrum of FTIs to gram-negative bacteria. The main purpose of FTIs is to inhibit FTase, an enzyme that, in eukaryotic cells, catalyzes the post-translational transfer of a C15 (farnesyl) isoprenoid moiety from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to a cysteine residue in target protein [37]. Together with geranylgeranyltransferases, FTase plays a central role in protein prenylation [38,39].\nThe formation of isoprenoids, necessary for the prenylation, such as FPP and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), relies on either the mevalonate pathway or, more commonly in bacteria, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway [40,41]. Independently of the biosynthetic pathway used, isoprenoids are universally distributed across all domains of life \u2013 bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes \u2013 and are essential for cell survival, including in bacterial pathogens [42]. This universality underscores their critical role in various cellular processes. Interestingly, the antimicrobial effects of FTIs appear to be independent of the biosynthetic pathway for isoprenoid production, as FTIs effectively inhibit the growth of bacteria utilizing both the MEP and mevalonate pathways [43]. Isoprenoids are vital for bacterial cells, serving roles in pathogenicity [44,45] and acting as intermediates in cell wall biosynthesis [46]. However, their utilization in protein prenylation within bacterial cells remains largely elusive [5].\nAs a ubiquitous covalent post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells, protein prenylation involves the attachment of isoprenoids like FPP or GGPP to proteins [47]. In contrast, bacteria rarely employ such modifications, as post-translational modifications are generally less prevalent in prokaryotes [48]. The extent of bacterial protein modification varies significantly among species and is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. Nevertheless, post-translational modifications can profoundly impact bacterial physiology and virulence regulation, altering protein structure, activity, localization, and biomolecular interactions [49]. While no evidence suggests that bacteria utilize an inherent protein prenylation machinery for post-translational modifications, some pathogenic bacteria exploit host-cell prenylation systems. For instance, bacterial effector proteins with a C-terminal CAAX motif have been shown to be prenylated by the host\u2019s prenylation machinery. This phenomenon has been observed in pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium and Legionella pneumophila [50\u201352]. Additionally, several other bacterial proteins, primarily from pathogenic strains, have been identified as potential targets for host-mediated prenylation, including possible farnesylation [53]. While endogenous bacterial protein prenylation remains largely unexplored, some exceptions exist. For instance, B. subtilis utilizes a distinct prenylation system for the quorum-sensing protein ComX, where a farnesyl group is transferred to a tryptophan residue by ComQ, rather than by FTase [54]. Notably, the antimicrobial effects observed in our study are also independent of host prenylation systems, suggesting that bacterial prenylation-related mechanisms may be relevant targets. Nonetheless, the reliance of these pathogens on host prenyltransferases does not preclude the possibility that bacterial prenyltransferases may also exist [5]. Therefore, the development of FTIs, which is already conducted in the field of cancer therapy, could also be of great importance in the treatment of infectious diseases of various kinds. For instance, lonafarnib is under clinical investigation for the treatment of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections. Additionally, lonafarnib shows promising effects for managing bronchiolitis and pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and has also demonstrated effects against SARS-CoV-2 [55\u201357]. Recent studies have also highlighted the antimicrobial effects of FTIs. We demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity of lonafarnib and tipifarnib \u2013 two non-peptidomimetic FTIs \u2013 against gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and even methicillin-resistant S. aureus. However, no activity of these compounds against gram-negative bacteria was reported, such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. It was hypothesized that the lack of activity was due to the OM of gram-negative bacteria, which serves as an additional intrinsic permeability barrier that is absent in gram-positive bacteria [5].\nIn the present study, colistin, a well-estab",
