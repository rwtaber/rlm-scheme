Introduction\nAcinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is a Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that has now become very important in the etiology of nosocomial infections, particularly in ICUs. The organism is associated with high morbidity and mortality because of its resistance to multiple drugs and because it causes serious infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia, trauma wounds, and urinary tract infections [1,2]. For example, mortality rates related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by A. Resistance rates for baumannii range from 30% to 75%, with the mortality rates of bloodstream infections being above 50% [3,4,5]. This is increased further in the immunocompromised ones [6,7]. The COVID-19 pandemic increased the cases of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii due to short supplies and increased ICU admissions [8].\nSurprisingly, this pathogen has acquired an unusual capability for disseminating resistance mechanisms utilizing \u03b2-lactamase production, efflux pump activation, and target site modification, making the treatment very difficult [9,10,11,12,13]. The global emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains has developed therapeutic intervention challenges, leaving very few options, including last-line antibiotics such as tigecycline and colistin [14,15]. In addition, A. baumannii uses virulent mechanisms such as biofilm formation and toxin secretion to enhance its pathogenicity and enable its persistence in healthcare environments, leading to protracted outbreaks [16,17,18,19,20]. Therefore, developing newer therapeutic strategies against this emerging public health threat becomes an urgent priority. The shikimate pathway is crucial in most living organisms, such as plants and microorganisms, yet it is absent in mammals (Figure 1). The terminal product of this pathway, chorismate, is a necessary precursor in the production of several essential metabolites, which include but are not confined to the aromatic amino acid folic acid and quinones [21]. The Shikimate kinase enzyme, a part of this pathway, catalyzes a phosphate transfer from ATP to the 3-hydroxyl group of shikimic acid, producing shikimate-3-phosphate (Figure 2) [22]. It contains three identifiable regions: the CORE motif refers to the conserved binding loop in the enzyme, essential for its catalytic activity and structural stability; the LID denotes the region that covers the active site and is critical for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) interaction; and a region of nucleotide monophosphate (NMP) binding responsible for interaction with shikimate [23].\nRecent progress in bioinformatics and computational drug design has increased the identification rate of new therapeutic agents [24,25,26]. For example, structure-based and ligand-based drug design approaches may effectively identify specific inhibitors with less toxicity. In this regard, drug repurposing represents a cost- and time-effective strategy to find new indications for the already FDA-approved drugs [27]. Drug repurposing has been utilized to find potential inhibitors of bacterial enzymes, and penicillin-binding proteins have been included among other potential bacterial targets [28,29,30,31]. The current study focuses on utilizing in-silico strategies for identifying FDA-approved drugs, non-drug compounds, and natural metabolites as selective active inhibitors of A. baumannii shikimate kinase. We integrated the approaches of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations with Density Functional Theory (DFT) computations while studying the binding affinity and stability of the proposed compounds. The experimental validations of in-silico results were determined by assessing MICs and MBCs for the compounds against A. baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis). Thus, the findings support these compounds\u2019 potential as effective therapeutic agents and contribute to optimizing the bioactive compounds against A. baumannii.\n\n## 2.1. Chemicals\nGallic acid, penicillin G, cefuroxime, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\n## 2.2. Generation of Databases and Ligand Library Preparation\nFDA-approved drugs and natural metabolites library was retrieved from the ZINC15 online server (https://zinc.docking.org/, accessed on 25 August 2023), a public web-accessible database containing over 750 million purchasable compounds. 1650 compounds were downloaded and saved in the 2D Structure-Data File (SDF) format and then imported into Maestro (Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2021\u20133:Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA, 2021). Hydrogen atoms were added to 1650 compounds using the LigPrep tool in Maestro (Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2021\u20133:Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA, 2021) The output was then energetically minimized and optimized using the OPLS3e force field, generating 3D chemical structures. Ionization was conducted with Epik at a neutral pH of 7.0 \u00b1 2.0, ensuring stereoisomers were preserved with specific chirality. The generation of tautomers and desalting were verified, and up to 32 stereoisomers per ligand were produced. This led to the generation of 2792 compounds. To avoid stereoisomeric duplicates of some compounds, the 2792 compounds were filtered using the Filter Duplicates tool in Maestro to exclude any stereoisomeric duplicates, resulting in 1590 unique compounds.\n\n## 2.3. Retrieval of Shikimate Kinase Crystal Structure and Preparation for Docking Analysis\nFigure 3 shows the three-dimensional X-ray crystallographic structure of Shikimate Kinase obtained from Acinetobacter baumannii in complex with Shikimate, protein data base (PDB) ID: 4Y0A, downloaded from (https://www.rcsb.org/, accessed on 25 August 2023). The visualization of the 3D structure was carried out using Pymol [32]. Protein Preparation Wizard in Maestro was utilized to fix missing residues and side chains and ensured proper protonation states at pH 7.0 using PROPKA (Version Release 2021\u20133). Loops were modeled using Prime, and bond orders were assigned. The pre-processing was extended to generating the Het state for the ligand in the protein\u2019s active site. Polarity hydrogens were added, non-essential waters were removed, and all heavy atoms converged to a root mean standard deviation (RMSD) of 0.3 \u00c5. The overall quality of the minimized structure was verified using a Ramachandran plot compared with the unminimized structure. The entire structure was minimized and optimized using the optimized potentials for liquid simulations 3 (OPLS3) force field and prepared for docking [33].\n\n## 2.4. Binding Site Determination and Docking Validation\nThe grid generation tool of the receptor was employed in generating the docking grid, specifying the 3D coordinates of the active sites of Acinetobacter baumannii shikimate kinase to be (5.11, 9.81, 19.51) for (x, y, z) within a confined volume of 20 \u00c5. This therefore created a centroid within the active site of the receptor and a grid box. Accuracy was ensured by redocking of the co-crystallized ligand, and docking poses and interactions were validated using Maestro by superimposition of structures and calculations of RMSD [34,35,36]. The receptor grid was centered on the bound ligand with a van der Waals radius scaling factor of 1.00 and partial charge cutoff of 0.25. The grid box enclosed the binding site, following all default parameters and with no constraints applied. This setup was then used to repeat and validate the docking in three different screening settings.\n\n## 2.5. Non-Covalent Docking Screening (Semi-Rigid Docking)\nThe ligand was docked without any constraints using the Glide tool [37], with a vdw radius scaling factor of 0.80 and partial charge cut-off of 0.15, considering ligands\u2019 flexibility, whereas in the protein it was rigid; all the other parameters were set to their default values. GlideScore implementation in Glide was used to predict binding affinity and rank the ligands. Each ligand was rank-ordered, selecting the lowest-energy docked pose by means of the pose rank. Further screening of the compounds was done with consideration of binding scores and the exact analysis of all types of binding interactions.\n\n## 2.6. Induced Fit Docking (Flexible Docking)\nUsing induced-fit docking (IFD) tool in Maestro, each ligand undergoes an initial docking using a softened potential, van der Waals radii scaling, and flexible conformational sampling. Then, side-chain prediction for a specified distance around every ligand pose is performed [38]. During this step, minimization of residues and the ligand in every protein/ligand complex pose occurs. It finally predicts a favorable binding pose based on the induced-fit docking (IFD) score.\n\n## 2.7. Screen Based on Shape\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Shape Screening tool was utilized. Shikimate was used as the reference structure in this process. Six compounds were screened using the pharmacophore volume scoring technique-scoring each compound as an ensemble of pharmacophore features made up of aromatic groups, hydrogen bond acceptors, hydrogen bond donors, hydrophobic regions, and positively and negatively charged groups. The similarity score for the shapes, Shape Sim score, was calculated from the best number of matching features among these compounds [39].\n\n## 2.8. Molecular Mechanics-Based Re-Scoring\nThe binding complexes were re-docked using molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) to improve the accuracy of affinity predictions [40]. MM/GBSA allows for increased accuracy by permitting flexibility in both the ligand and the receptor-a crucial factor for physiological relevance [41]. Consequently, an extended MM/GBSA simulation was carried out to determine the ranking of binding affinities of the identified eight hits against the target abSK. Initial XP complexes of abSK hits and shikimate were redocked in Maestro using MM/GBSA, in which flexibility was induced by adjusting the distance between hits or shikimate and abSK to 5 \u00c5. The simulation involved the VGSB solvation model with the OPLS3 force [42].\n\n## 2.9. Molecular Dynamics Simulation Studies\nThe subsequent high-scoring complex was further evaluated with molecular dynamics (MD) in maestro. Desmond System Builder was used to prepare the simulation system; then the receptor-ligand complex was soaked into the TIP3P solvent model buffer system with 0.15M sodium chloride [43]. The volume of the solvent box was minimized under the OPLS4 force field, and the final system contained approximately 25,000 atoms.\nThe final system was retrieved for a 100 ns MD simulation, starting with the system relaxation using the default protocol. During the simulation, the isothermal-isobaric NPT entity at 310 K temperature and 1.103 bar pressure was adopted [44]. The other parameters, including the Coulombic cutoff distance and reversible reference system propagator algorithm integrator, were kept at their default settings. Afterward, the simulation results were analyzed using the Desmond Simulation Interaction Diagram tool [45].\n\n## 2.10. ADMET Properties and Drug-Likeness Predictions\nWe have used the pkCSM web server, (http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/pkcsm/prediction, accessed on 2 November 2023) [46] to predict descriptors for both ADMET and drug-likeness properties for the final selected potential inhibitors. Eight molecular descriptors were generated in order to characterize the ADMET properties of the potential abSK hits. Additionally, Pfizer\u2019s rule (Lipinski rule of five) was applied to predict the physicochemical properties of the potential inhibitors, focusing on essential drug-like properties such as molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficient (logP), hydrogen bond donors, and hydrogen bond acceptors [47].\n\n## 2.11. Quantum Mechanics and Global Chemical Reactivity\nThe quantum mechanics calculations of the selected best two potential inhibitors were carried out using the Gaussian 09 package (Wallingford, CT) [48]. GaussView (6-0) program was used to interpret and visualize the global energy structure of potential inhibitors [39]. The density functional theory (DFT) was selected with a reliable theoretical function method at the B3LYP/6-311++ G(d,p) as a triple zeta basis set [40,41]. All the optimized three-dimensional structures were assessed in neutral form. The optimized structures were used to investigate the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis, including the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and the energy gap (Egap). Additionally, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) [49,50] and the global chemical descriptors were discussed, such as electron affinity (EA), ionization potential (IP), global chemical hardness (\u03b7), global chemical softness (\u03c3), electronegativity (\u03c7), and electrophilicity (\u03c9) were estimated according to Koopmans\u2019 theory [51,52,53,54,55,56].\n\n## 2.12. Microbial Strains and Media\nThe bacterial cultures used in this study included Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC BAA-747, which was cultured on MacConkey agar Condalab, cat:1052, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, which was grown on blood agar SPLM with 5% sheep blood (SPLM; cat-1009). The cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, when the bacteria had reached appropriate growth. On the following day, bacterial suspensions were prepared to the 0.5 McFarland standard (approximately 1.8 \u00d7 108 CFU/mL). Seven serial dilutions for each tested compound (Penicillin G, cefuroxime, X = Gallic acid, XI = Gallic acid & penicillin G, XII = Gallic acid & cefuroxime) were made starting with an initial concentration of 10 mg/mL. The inoculum and the serially diluted test compounds were dispensed into a microdilution plate. Each tube should contain 100 \u00b5L of PBS, and 50 \u00b5L of the compounds were transferred to the next tube in the series, and the microdilution plate was incubated. After the incubation, 150 \u00b5L of each dilution was added to 50 \u00b5L of the prepared 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension in 96-well microplates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Following the incubation period, the microdilution plate was read to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value by assessing visibility.\nNext, 10 \u00b5L from each well of the microdilution plate was withdrawn and cultured on blood agar media for Enterococcus faecalis while using MacConkey agar for Acinetobacter baumannii. Finally, incubate the agar plates were incubated, and dilutions were made in a 1:4 series (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128, 1/256, continuing up to 1/32,768). A 150 \u00b5L of each dilution was added to 50 \u00b5L of the prepared 0.5 McFarland bacterial suspension in 96-well microplates and were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. After incubation, 10 \u00b5L of each well was cultured to determine the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) were calculated as per the Clinical and Laboratory Institute guidelines [57].\n\n## 2.13. Statistical Analysis of Data\nData is presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism software 8.0.2 (2019) (San Diego, CA, USA). All the antimicrobial comparisons were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistically significant was taken as p < 0.05.\n\n## 3.1. High-Quality Protein Structure Evaluation\nEnergy minimization has been used to remove steric clashes of the SK enzyme structure representing high-energy conformations that would most likely result in unstable complex formations during simulations. However, this minimization can also introduce some unfavorable contacts within the structure and might affect the conformation of the enzyme. Therefore, it is very important to assess the enzyme structure before and after minimization to ensure that an energy-optimized model will be used for precise prediction in both docking and simulation studies. The Ramachandran plot of the pre-minimized SK enzyme showed 92.9% of the residues in the favored region, while for the minimized enzyme, 92.3% of residues were in the favored region. Neither in pre-minimized nor minimized structures was any residue present in the disallowed regions. Figure 4 depicts the Ramachandran plots of both states.\n\n## 3.2. Docking Studies\nThe co-crystalline ligand was redocked into its target abSK using the same procedure and protocol applied for the six hits to validate docking. Subsequently, rigid-body superposition was performed using Maestro\u2019s structure superposition tool to align the predicted lowest energy conformation of the target with its corresponding co-crystalline ligand. The classical RMSD from the co-crystalline pose was calculated for the predicted binding poses, with an RMSD < 2 \u00c5 considered an effective threshold for validating correctly posed molecules [58,59]. The results showed good binding mode superimposition, with an RMSD of 0.911 \u00c5 for shikimate, reflecting the accuracy of Glide\u2019s pose prediction (Figure 5).\nThe SP docking study identified eight hits, including gallic acid, 4-aminosalicylic acid, mepiroxol, paraben, mesalazine, oxypurinol, and piracetam (Figure 6). However, 4-aminosalicylic acid and mesalazine were excluded from further analysis by the aggregation advisor tool [60]. The binding affinities of the remaining six hits were assessed against abSK. Initially, the inhibition profiles of these six hits were examined by docking them into the binding pockets of the target, investigating their binding patterns, target interactions, and binding affinities compared to the reference shikimate.\n\n## 3.3. Computational Analysis of the Six Hits Binding to abSK\nThe findings presented in Table 1 offer valuable insights into the binding affinities and interaction profiles of the selected hit compounds with the target enzyme abSK. The application of induced-fit docking (IFD) was crucial in generating accurate complex structures for these hits, allowing the identification of true binders that might have been initially overlooked due to poor scores (false negatives). This was accomplished by employing multiple receptor conformations obtained through the IFD protocol rather than relying on a single rigid conformation, thereby enhancing the reliability of the screening process [37]. Gallic acid exhibited significant polar interactions and high binding affinity. Key interactions include an ionic bond between Arg-153 in the core domain and the carboxylate group of gallic acid and a second ionic interaction between Arg-74 in the shikimate binding domain (SB domain) and the carboxylate group. These ionic interactions are essential for gallic acid\u2019s strong binding affinity and stability within the active site. Additionally, gallic acid forms two hydrogen bonds: one between the Asp-50 side-chain carboxyl (SB domain) and the hydroxyl groups at C5 and C6 of gallic acid and another between the main-chain amine of Arg-134 (Lid domain). Mepiroxol, another notable compound, exhibits similar interaction patterns. It forms salt bridges with Arg-153 and Arg-74 and two hydrogen bonds involving Asp-50 and Gly-96 with its terminal hydroxyl group. These interactions contribute to its strong binding affinity and high docking score. Paraben also shows substantial binding interactions, including a salt bridge with Arg-153 and two hydrogen bonds with Arg-74 and Arg-153. These interactions support its relatively high binding affinity and docking score. Favorable binding-based 2D and 3D docking positions interact with key residues within the binding pocket, as shown in (Figure 7 and Figure 8).\n\n## 3.4. Shape Similarity Prediction\nMolecules with similar shapes often fit in the same binding pocket and have similar biological activity. This is based on several different shape-describing descriptors mentioned earlier. This has succeeded as a virtual screening methodology in a chemical library for compounds similar to a given query molecule. According to Table 2, gallic acid has the highest score of shape similarity among the tested compounds. Structural similarity between gallic acid and shikimate is crucial for entry into interactions with the abSK enzyme. Indeed, gallic acid and shikimate share several crucial structural features responsible for these compounds\u2019 high shape similarity scores.\n\n## 3.5. Binding Free Energies Analysis\nThe MM-GBSA method has been employed for post-docking analysis to confirm the binding affinity of compounds towards SK, showing variable values of free energies for each complex. It has been observed that the MM-GBSA approach is very reliable in affinity predictions, primarily providing more accurate results compared to standard docking estimates. Furthermore, this method was employed for cross-verification of the docking results, and accordingly, the range of binding free energies as calculated via MM-GBSA is presented in Table 3. These results correspond to net binding free energies of \u221249.19 kcal/mol for gallic acid, \u221243.71 kcal/mol for mepiroxol, \u221241.33 kcal/mol for paraben, \u221234.9 kcal/mol for piracetam, \u221212.11 kcal/mol for oxypurinol and \u22128.63 kcal/mol for oteracil.\n\n## 3.6. Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Gallic Acid Binding to the abSK Target\nBased on the initial docking results, gallic acid was chosen for further analysis by MD perturbation. In the MD study, both the protein\u2019s RMSD in complex with the gallic acid was maintained below 3.0 (Figure 9A), signaling that they formed a stable complex [17,18]. Furthermore, when gallic acid was fitted on abSK target, its RMSD was maintained below that of the target protein showing that it was kept on the binding pocket [61]. Rapid ligand fluctuations briefly occurred between 40 and 80 ns, however, these were followed by the re-establishment of equilibration (Figure 9A). Prominent interactions that contributed to the binding pose of gallic acid to 4Y03 included hydrogen bonds that were supplemented by both the water bridges and ionic bonds from the ASP50, ARG74, and ARG153 residues (Figure 9B). This directly correlated with the initial docking results (Figure 7 and Figure 8 and Table 1).\n\n## 3.7. ADMET and Drug-Likeness\nPoor pharmacokinetic properties lead to massive drug wastage and increased cost in drug development. Thus, determining Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) becomes crucial in drug discovery and development. The ideal candidate should be effective at its site of action and exhibit good ADMET properties at therapeutic doses. In all, six drug candidates underwent extensive pharmacokinetic assessments to guide the chemist in optimizing molecular structures with strong pharmacokinetic attributes. Molecular descriptors were utilized to get an idea about absorption mechanisms and possible administration routes, as well as prediction of bioavailability, water solubility, Caco-2 permeability, and human intestinal absorption. As illustrated in Table 4, good predictions of oral absorption were made for most compounds, but modifications are required in oteracil, gallic acid, and oxypurinol to improve the permeability in Caco-2. Also, none of them could cross the blood-brain barrier or enter the central nervous system, suggesting thereby limited distribution through these pathways.\nMetabolic analysis indicates that interaction with CYP450 isoforms is not apparent for the selected candidates, hence decreasing the risk for complications associated with metabolic pathways. The excretion profile was considered efficient for both total clearance and renal OCT2 activities without substrate specificity for renal OCT2. Toxicological descriptors were generated based on pharmacodynamics studies: AMES toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, hepatotoxicity, and hERG inhibition. All the compounds, except piracetam, were predicted to be nontoxic; therefore, piracetam is a candidate for further experimental testing. Finally, drug-likeness of such inhibitors was analyzed to assess their overall ADMET profiles. This evaluation utilized the well-known Lipinski\u2019s Rule of Five as a benchmark to calculate relevant descriptors. According to Lipinski\u2019s guidelines, a compound is generally considered suitable for development as a drug or lead candidate if it maintains a molecular weight under 500 g/mol, possesses fewer than ten hydrogen bond acceptors and fewer than five hydrogen bond donors, and has an octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) of five or less. Deviations from more than one of these criteria could lead to suboptimal oral absorption and permeability. Results detailed in Table 5 indicate that all examined inhibitors adhere to these drug-like criteria.\n\n## 3.8.1. Structure Optimization\nFrequency of all the optimized structures without any imaginary frequencies to ensure their stability at a minimum energy level. The dihedral angle indicates the planarity of the optimized structure in its ground state. The dihedral angle is planar when the angle approaches 0\u00b0 or \u00b1180\u00b0. As shown in (Figure 10), most of the molecular geometries are nearly planar, except the C-O of the hydroxyl group in Mepiroxol, which is about 22.98\u00b0, while the para-hydroxyl group in Shikimate is approximately \u2212167.21\u00b0 due to the non-planarity of the cyclohexene ring. In addition, the bond length of gallic acid between the C-carbonyl group and para-oxygen of the hydroxyl group was 5.62 \u00c5, while in Shikimate, it was slightly longer at 5.71 \u00c5 due to the C-C SP3 bond in cyclohexene longer compared with the C-C SP2 in the benzene ring of gallic acid.\n\n## 3.8.2. Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO)\nFrontier molecular orbital (FMO) is crucial to understanding electronic properties with the reactivity behavior of the chemical compounds [62]. The influence of FMO on organic compounds and their biological activity, particularly in the field of antimicrobial research, has become increasingly significant [63,64,65]. FMO investigates the energy level of the highest orbital, including electrons, and the lowest orbital empty. The HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) represent the ability of a compound to act as an electron donor. A more negative number (small value) of the EHOMO refers to the compound\u2019s inability to donate electrons easily. The EHOMO values of the best two potential inhibitors and shikimate decreased in the following order: Mepiroxol > Gallic acid > Shikimate. (Figure 11). On the other hand, the LUMO energy levels (ELUMO) indicate that the molecule can act as an electron acceptor. A more negative number of ELUMO means a rising tendency to accept electrons. The ELUMO values decrease in the following order: Mepiroxol > Gallic acid > Shikimate. Consequently, the Shikimate and gallic acid displayed a low ability to donate electrons but a high ability to accept electrons during reactions. Also, the kinetic stability of the molecule was associated with energy gap calculation (Egap). The greater the value for Egap, the more kinetically stable the molecule. Therefore, the Egap values of Shikimate and Gallic acid are highest showing the lowest tendency towards chemical reactivity.\n\n## 3.8.3. Global Chemical Descriptors\nIonization energy represents the least energy needed to withdraw an electron from the valence energy level of an isolated atom or compound. On the contrary, electron affinity (EA) represents the value of energy released when one electron is added to a neutral gaseous state of an atom or compound and transformed into a negative ion. The increasing ionization potential (IP) and EA values indicate that the compound is less favorable as an electron donor and more able to act as an electron acceptor [66]. Shikimate and gallic acid have the highest values of IP and EA compared to mepiroxol. The chemical hardness (\u03b7) and softness (\u03c3) are two essential factors that are associated with Pearson\u2019s hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB), and they describe the reactivity of compounds [64]. Harder compounds are less reactive and have a higher difference in energy between HOMO and LUMO. At the same time, a rising value of softness indicates reactivity and lower stability. The results reveal that Mepiroxol exhibits significant softness and slight hardness, indicating higher reactivity and lower stability than Shikimate and Gallic acid. In addition, the higher electronegativity means that atoms in molecules readily attract electrons toward themselves. Calculated electronegativity (\u03c7) shows that Shikimate and Gallic acid present higher values and thus present a higher tendency to receive electrons from the environment than Mepiroxol. Finally, the electrophilicity index (\u03ce) reflects the properties of molecules as electron receivers and thus be better electron acceptors [67]. Shikimate and Gallic acid present higher electrophilicity compared with Mepiroxol, thus suggesting that they are more efficient electron receivers (Table 6).\n\n## 3.8.4. Molecular Electrostatic Potential\nMolecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) describes the charge distribution of the 3D optimized structure of the selected potential inhibitor, shape, size, and orientation [52]. This is one of the techniques used for evaluating the reactivity of a molecule by predicting electrophilic and nucleophilic atoms [53]. It also provides evidence of which atoms in the molecule can interact with biological systems. The negative values of red color regions correspond to the electrophilic attacks, the blue sites (positives) represent the nucleophilic attacks, and the white parts indicate a neutral atom in a molecule. Figure 12 indicated that the oxygen atom in hydroxyl, carbonyl, and pyridine-N-oxide is the most negatively charged site in all the selected compounds. On the contrary, the hydrogen that is bonded with the oxygen atom is highly electronegative; hence, its site is more positive. The central rings of benzene or cyclohexene were almost neutral.\n\n## 3.9. Antimicrobial Activity (MIC and MBC)\nAntimicrobial activity assays showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations for X = gallic acid, XI = gallic acid ",
