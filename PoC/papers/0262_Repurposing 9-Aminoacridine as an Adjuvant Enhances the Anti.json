  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of clinically acquired infections, causing respiratory, urinary, and blood infections (1, 2). Over the last decade, the increasing occurrence of extremely drug-resistant (XDR) and pan-drug-resistant (PDR) K. pneumoniae has posed a serious threat to global public health (3, 4). Drug-resistant K. pneumoniae infections are often associated with high mortality rates (5, 6). Since antimicrobial therapeutic options for multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae-mediated infections are limited, it is urgent to develop novel antimicrobials or therapeutic strategies.\nDrug repurposing and combination are two attractive strategies to combat bacterial resistance. The advantages of these strategies include enhanced antibacterial efficacy, reduced therapeutic dosage of a single drug, fewer adverse effects, prevented occurrence of drug resistance, sustainable cost, and faster clinical validation (7, 8).\nRifampin (RIF) is known to target bacterial polymerase. Disruption of cell wall integrity could promote RIF invasion and exhibit antimicrobial effects against Gram-negative bacteria (9). Thus, based on what is described above, a library containing 2,049 FDA-approved compounds was tested in combination with RIF by high-throughput assay to find drugs targeting cell wall permeability in our study. Through a series of phenotypic and mechanistic experiments, we repurposed a potential small molecule, 9-aminoacridine (9-AA), as an antimicrobial alone or synergistically with RIF against multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. Meanwhile, 9-AA exerted antibacterial effects by the specific bacterial DNA interaction and proton motive force (PMF) disruption. At present, 9-AA and its derivatives have also been reported or are in clinical trials for their efficacy in cancers, prion, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (10\u201312). RIF is an efficient antibiotic against most Gram-positive bacteria and is a key drug used for the treatment of Mycobacterium. Clinically, RIF is not generally used for treating K. pneumoniae infection. In this study, 9-AA was found to synergize with RIF against K. pneumoniae\nin vitro and in vivo and decreased the resistance-inducing ability of RIF. By mechanistic study, we revealed the specific bacterial DNA interaction activities and PMF disruption by 9-AA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the antibacterial activity and its underlying mechanisms of 9-AA alone or combined with RIF against multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae.\n\n## Antimicrobial molecule 9-AA against \nHigh-throughput screening was conducted as described above, and the flowchart is shown in Fig.\u00a01A. After screening step 1, 111 hits were selected for their potential synergistic activity with RIF against K. pneumoniae. After excluding antibiotics and well-studied compounds among 111 hits, 16 hits were further subjected to the checkboard assay with RIF (supplemental file 2). Among these hits, 9-AA had a strong synergistic effect with RIF for all tested sensitive and multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae, with fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values of 0.375, 0.5, and 0.313, respectively (Fig.\u00a01B). To further confirm the synergistic effects observed in the checkerboard assays, time-kill curves were measured (Fig.\u00a01C). Monotherapy with the sub-MIC of 9-AA or RIF did not completely inhibit bacterial growth. In contrast, the 9-AA-RIF combination significantly inhibited the growth of ATCC 700603 and showed strong bactericidal effects against the XDR and PDR strains. Next, primary antimicrobial susceptibility tests of 9-AA against Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (\u201cESKAPE\u201d) pathogens are shown in Table\u00a01. 9-AA had a strong antimicrobial effect on K. pneumoniae, with MICs from 8 to 16\u2009\u03bcg/mL and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) from 16 to 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL. However, 9-AA only exhibited moderate or no antimicrobial activity against other pathogens (Table\u00a01). 9-AA was also found to enhance the antimicrobial activity of RIF against other type strains or clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae, with the MIC values of RIF decreased by 2- to 4-fold in the presence of sub-MIC (2\u2009\u03bcg/mL) 9-AA (Table\u00a02).\n\n## Decreased antibiotic resistance-inducing ability of RIF by 9-AA.\nIt has been reported that RIF easily induces bacterial resistance (13, 14). The emergence of resistant mutants has also been reported when RIF was used in combination with other antibiotics (15, 16). To examine the effects of 9-AA on the resistance-inducing ability of RIF, multistep resistance selection and single-step resistance selection were applied. For multistep resistance selection, as shown in Fig.\u00a02A, when K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, KPWANG, and LH2020 were cultured in the presence of a sub-MIC of RIF for 25 passages, the MIC values were increased 16-, 128-, and 32-fold, respectively. However, those strains retained relatively stable MICs to RIF in the presence of the sub-MIC of 9-AA. Meanwhile, the MICs of 9-AA against the last-passage RIF-induced resistant K. pneumoniae strains remained unchanged or only slightly increased (Fig.\u00a02B). Similarly, as shown in Fig.\u00a02C, the combination of RIF and 9-AA remained highly synergistically sensitive against the RIF-induced resistant K. pneumoniae strains, with no elevated FICI observed. In accordance, for single-step resistance selection, the resistance induction rate of RIF in the sub-MIC 9-AA group was lower than that in the single RIF group (Fig.\u00a02D and E). In general, RIF combined with the sub-MIC of 9-AA can overcome the shortcoming that RIF readily induces bacterial resistance.\n\n## Bacterial DNA is a potential target of 9-AA.\nWe initially speculated that 9-AA enhanced RIF antibacterial activity by interacting with bacterial cell wall components. Thus, a peptide peptidoglycan (PGN) competitive inhibition assay was performed. However, as shown in Fig. S1A and Table S2 in the supplemental material, the MICs and MBCs, as well as the time growth curves, showed no difference between groups in the presence or absence of PGN. Similarly, no membrane-disrupting activity was observed in the presence of different concentrations of 9-AA through staining with the fluorescence probe SYTOX green (Fig. S1B). For bacterial outer membrane detection, as shown in Fig. S1C, the synergistic potentiation of 9-AA to RIF showed no change with the addition of the sub-MIC of Mg2+ (an outer membrane strengthener) and decreased with the addition of the sub-MIC of EDTA (an outer membrane-abolishing reagent). The above-described results indicate that 9-AA does not target the cell wall component of K. pneumoniae.\nWe next examined the effect of 9-AA on bacterial DNA. Because of the fluorescence characteristics of 9-AA (Fig. S2), we speculated directly observing the 9-AA location in bacterial cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Thus, the bacterial or mammalian cells were treated with 9-AA and then costained with FM4-64 (a membrane-staining dye) and propidium iodide (PI; a nuclear dye). CLSM images showed that the staining of 9-AA colocalized with both FM4-64 and PI in K. pneumoniae cells, which indicates that 9-AA may target both the cell membrane and DNA (Fig.\u00a03A). However, as we mentioned above, no membrane disruption activity was observed by 9-AA through SYTOX green staining. Thus, we speculate that there was only an accumulation of 9-AA in the cell membrane, which probably further caused PMF disruption between the inner and outer membranes. As a control, the tetracycline (TET)-treated bacterial cells only exhibited colocalization with PI. In addition, as shown in Fig.\u00a03A, no obvious infiltration was observed in mammalian cells by 9-AA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of 9-AA-treated bacteria showed that the overall bacterial morphology had obvious distortion and deformation, while dense material aggregated in the bacteria, which suggests possible chromatin aggregation (Fig.\u00a03B). Similarly, the fluorescence measurement indicated that 9-AA led to a dose-dependent displacement of the DNA-binding probe SYTO 9 (Fig.\u00a03C). By the addition of exogenous DNA, we found that the antimicrobial activity of 9-AA was significantly suppressed. The bacterial growth turbidity of the 9-AA plus 0.2\u2009\u03bcg/mL DNA-treated group was significantly higher than that of the 9-AA group (Fig.\u00a03D). Similar to the CFU counting, the total bacterial count of the 9-AA plus 0.2\u2009\u03bcg/mL DNA-treated group was higher than that of the 9-AA-treated group (Fig.\u00a03E). Then, molecular docking was carried out to simulate the binding mode between 9-AA and DNA. As shown in Table\u00a03 and Fig. S3, 9-AA showed the best binding affinity to the DNA site of PDB accession no. 4U8A, with a predicted binding energy of \u22124.98\u2009kcal/mol among these tested sites. The binding mode of 9-AA with PDB accession no. 4U8A is illustrated in Fig.\u00a03F and G. In brief, 9-AA could interact with dg465 through a hydrogen bonding interaction and with dt81, da82, da83, da464, dg466, and dg477 through hydrophobic interactions. The molecular docking results further confirmed the stable binding of 9-AA to DNA. These results indicated that bacterial DNA is a potential target of 9-AA.\n\n## PMF disruption by 9-AA.\nBy scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, thornlike protrusions and depressions could be observed on the bacterial surface after treatment with 8\u00d7 MIC of 9-AA (Fig.\u00a04A), and the average cell diameter was also decreased after treatment (Fig.\u00a04B). Considering that no membrane disruption activity was observed by 9-AA through SYTOX green staining, we speculate that there was an accumulation of 9-AA in the cell membrane, and it probably further caused PMF disruption between the inner and outer membranes. In bacteria, PMF is an electrochemical gradient of protons across the cell membrane and is indispensable to bacterial cellular processes such as ATP synthesis and transport of various solutes (17). PMF consists of the sum of two parts, the electric potential (\u0394\u03a8) and the transmembrane proton gradient (\u0394 pH). The pH-sensitive probe BCECF-AM was used to measure \u0394pH, and 9-AA caused decreased fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner in K. pneumoniae (Fig.\u00a04C), which indicated that the \u0394pH value increased. The membrane potential-sensitive dye DiSC3(5) was used to measure \u0394\u03a8, and 9-AA led to an increase in fluorescence (Fig.\u00a04D), which indicated that \u0394\u03a8 was dissipated. Because \u0394\u03a8 and \u0394pH are interdependent, when one of the components is destroyed, the other will increase to keep the PMF constant (18). To further confirm the interaction with PMF by 9-AA, media with different pH values were prepared. As we expected, the increase in the external pH value enhanced the antibacterial effect of 9-AA (Fig.\u00a04E and F). As previously reported, membrane depolarization and \u0394\u03a8 disruption are related to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (19). Similarly, in our study, 9-AA also promoted the accumulation of intracellular ROS (Fig.\u00a04G), but the intracellular ATP levels significantly increased after treatment with 9-AA (Fig.\u00a04H). Furthermore, as we expected, 9-AA showed partial synergy with TET, whose uptake is driven by \u0394pH (20, 21), and antagonized FeCl3, which increased \u0394\u03a8 (Fig.\u00a04I). In addition, as shown in Fig.\u00a04J, 9-AA showed significant surface motility inhibition activity against K. pneumoniae. As previously reported, surface motility was powered by the PMF (22, 23).\n\n## Acceptable \nThe cytotoxicity of 9-AA was assessed by hemolysis assays and a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Japan) kit. 9-AA did not exhibit hemolytic activity on red blood cells (RBCs) even at concentrations up to 64\u2009\u03bcg/mL (Fig.\u00a05A). As observed by phase-contrast microscopy, the morphology of 128\u2009\u03bcg/mL 9-AA-treated RBCs was normal compared to that of the control group, but obvious shrinkage was observed after Triton X-100 (positive control) treatment (Fig.\u00a05B). To improve the safety of 9-AA, we constructed 9-AA(L). The characterization of 9-AA(L) was well studied and shown in Materials and Methods and supplemental file 1. The cell viability of human normal and tumor cell lines after treatment with 9-AA or 9-AA/L is shown in Fig.\u00a05C, and the related 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) are listed in Table S3. 9-AA showed moderate cytotoxicity to mammalian cells, but when used as a RIF adjuvant, the reduced dosage of 9-AA further diminished its toxicity. Liposome-encapsulated drugs in lipid bilayers are one of the delivery systems that can effectively reduce drug toxicity (24, 25). As we expected, 9-AA(L) significantly relieved its cytotoxicity and increased its IC50 values (Fig.\u00a05C and D; Table S3). Collectively, 9-AA has acceptable toxicity as an adjuvant or 9-AA(L).\n\nWe constructed the wound infection model and skin subcutaneous abscess model following the flowchart in Fig. S5. Then, the antimicrobial efficacy of 9-AA alone or in combination with RIF was assessed by viable bacterial cell counting and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In the wound infection model, the counting of the 0.5% (wt/wt) 9-AA- or RIF ointment-treated group showed no or moderate CFU decrease, but the combination group significantly reduced the bacterial counts by 3.18 log10 (versus vehicle) and 1.12 log10 CFU/mL (versus the RIF-treated group), respectively (Fig.\u00a06A). In subcutaneous skin abscesses, a single dose of 15\u2009mg/kg 9-AA decreased the abscess area compared with that in the vehicle group (Fig.\u00a06B). By CFU counting, a single dose of 15\u2009mg/kg 9-AA or 20\u2009mg/kg RIF did not significantly reduce the viable bacterial loads in the abscess; however, the combined use of the drugs significantly decreased the bacterial load by 3.15 log10 CFU/abscess (Fig.\u00a06C). Consistently, H&E staining images showed that significantly reduced inflammatory infiltration was observed in the combination group compared to the monotherapy group (Fig.\u00a06D).\nFurthermore, the antibacterial activity of 9-AA liposomes in vivo was assessed. After treatment with 15\u2009mg/kg 9-AA(L), 7.5\u2009mg/kg plus 7.5\u2009mg/kg 9-AA plus RIF(L), and 15\u2009mg/kg plus 15\u2009mg/kg 9-AA plus RIF(L), the bacterial loads in the abscess were reduced by 0.80, 1.62, and 2.90 log10 CFU/abscess, respectively (Fig.\u00a06E). Consistently, H&E-stained sections of skin tissues from liposome-treated mice revealed no inflammatory infiltration (Fig.\u00a06F).\nMeanwhile, the in vivo toxicity was also determined. No statistical significance was detected for hematological liver functional, renal functional, or myocardial functional biomarkers between the drug-treated and vehicle groups (Fig. S6A and B). Similarly, the H&E staining of these organs with 9-AA and 9-AA(L) treatment showed no pathological changes (Fig. S6C).\n\n## Synergistic antibacterial effects between 9-AA analogs and RIF.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a07A, the antimicrobial synergistic effects against K. pneumoniae were also observed in 9-AA analogs in combination with RIF. Different from the combination of 9-AA with RIF, although the combinations of 9-AA analogs and RIF were efficient in bacterial growth inhibition, all these combinations lacked bactericidal activity against K. pneumoniae during the 24-h treatment period (Fig.\u00a07B). In addition, the cytotoxicity of 9-AA analogs was measured in various cell lines. However, the analogs were more toxic to most of the tested human cell lines than 9-AA (Table S3). Further, the checkerboard assay was performed to assess the combinational antimicrobial effects of 9-AA and 9-AA analogs with other conventional antibiotics against K. pneumoniae. As shown in Fig. S7, no synergistic effect was found between the analogs and conventional antibiotics except for the combination of ethacridine and doxycycline. These results suggested that the synergistic activity between 9-AA and 9-AA analogs with RIF could be antibiotic specific. In summary, 9-AA has the greatest potential to develop as an antibacterial agent among its analogs.\n\n## DISCUSSION\nK. pneumoniae causes a wide range of infections, and the rapid spread of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains has made treatment increasingly difficult. Our study repurposes the potential small molecule 9-AA alone or combined with RIF, which exhibits strong antimicrobial activity against extensively or pan-drug-resistant K. pneumoniae through specific bacterial DNA interactions and PMF disruption. Meanwhile, 9-AA combined with RIF also displayed effective antimicrobial activity in vivo without detectable toxicity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically investigate the potential of 9-AA as an antibacterial agent or an antimicrobial adjuvant with RIF against multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains in vitro and in vivo.\nRecent studies on repurposing 9-AA and its derivatives have more often focused on their effectiveness in treating cancers, prions, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (10\u201312). Some studies have also shown that 9-AA coupled to Arabic gum dialdehyde and 9-AA hydrochloride hydrate conjugated with nanoparticles enhanced their antimicrobial activities (26, 27); however, these studies on the antibacterial effect of 9-AA were limited to type strains and in vitro nonmechanism experiments.\n9-AA enhanced the antibacterial activity of RIF against both sensitive and multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. Although RIF can easily induce resistant mutant strains (13, 14) and the emergence of resistant mutants when RIF was used in combination with other antibiotics has also been reported (15, 16), in our study, when combined with the sub-MIC of 9-AA, RIF had a relatively low tendency for resistance development. Though the MIC values of K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and KPWANG in the combinational group had some degree of increase by multistep resistance selection, there was still no drug resistance that emerged in short-term treatment (within 10 passages) (Fig.\u00a02A). These results suggest that 9-AA suppressed the development of RIF resistance. Also, 9-AA and RIF combination still showed synergistic antibacterial activity against RIF-induced resistant K. pneumoniae strains (Fig.\u00a02C), which indicated that the RIF resistance mutation did not easily affect the synergistic antibacterial activity of 9-AA and RIF.\nPrevious studies showed 9-AA is a mutagen which target nucleic acids and cause gene mutations (28\u201330). However, comparing nucleotide incorporation assay and gel electrophoresis used in previous research, CLSM and SEM images in our present study showed 9-AA targeted bacterial DNA more intuitively. Molecular docking can better predict the binding interaction and evaluate the interaction forces of 9-AA and bacterial DNA. Since RIF targets the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to inhibit DNA transcription (14, 31), 9-AA and RIF may synergistically inhibit DNA function to exert antibacterial effect. In addition, we found that PMF was also a potential target of 9-AA. 9-AA dissipated \u0394\u03a8, and then the \u0394 pH increased compensatively. When compounds disrupt \u0394\u03a8, a synergism effect will be observed in combination with antibiotics which are driven by \u0394 pH, while antagonism will show in combination with antibiotics whose uptake depends on \u0394\u03a8 (32, 33). This provides us with new strategies to find new antimicrobial combinations, for example, 9-AA and tetracycline antibiotics (Fig.\u00a04I). PMF disruption was also reported to be associated with the recovery of antibiotic potentiation (34). Thus, 9-AA exerted its antibacterial effect through dual mechanisms, interacting with specific bacterial DNA and disrupting the PMF in K. pneumoniae. Similarly, several studies have previously reported dual-mechanism antibacterial agents. Polyhexamethylene biguanide functions by targeting the bacterial membrane and DNA (35). Alternatively, amphiphilic CoB oligoguanidine has a dual mechanism of action that involves membrane disruption and DNA inhibition (36). SCH-79797 and its derivative IRS-16 have two independent cellular targets, bacterial membrane and folate metabolism (37). Telavancin is a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide that inhibits cell wall synthesis and disrupts bacterial cell membrane barrier functions (38). Antibiotics with dual mechanisms are potential agents to address drug resistance and have advantages, including broad-spectrum efficacy, excellent therapeutic index, low resistance generation rate, and excellent in vivo activity. In our study, 9-AA also showed these strengths. DNA-targeted drugs may induce DNA lesions in human normal cells and further lead to diseases such as cancer. But in our study, 9-AA is not easy to damage the DNA of normal cells. First, in the DNA mechanistic experiment, no obvious 9-AA infiltration was observed in mammalian cells during the assay, while the bacterial cell membrane and DNA were bound by 9-AA (Fig.\u00a03A). It is indicated 9-AA could selectively target bacteria in a short time treatment. Second, our study focuses on the localized infection model and topical medication, it is not easy to produce systemic and long-term toxicity. Third, drug combination can lower the drug dosage and reduce potential toxicity, including cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Finally, the clinical course of one antibiotic is often shorter than 2 weeks; otherwise, it will cause flora imbalance and drug resistance (39). Also, a previous study has reported the low genotoxicity of 9-AA (40). We will continue to conduct further structural modifications of 9-AA to improve its efficacy and safety.\nSkin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are significant clinical and economic burdens in health care facilities (41, 42). A SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance report (North America) noted that Klebsiella spp. make up 5.1% of the pathogens isolated from SSTIs (43). K. pneumoniae has been increasingly proposed as a cause of SSTIs, and multidrug-resistant strains make treatment more challenging. Meanwhile, few studies reported infections associated with high bacterial densities (>107 CFU/mL bacteria). Hence, we constructed a high-bacterial-density wound infection model and skin subcutaneous abscess model. As we expected, 9-AA and 9-AA(L) combined with RIF exhibited strong in vivo antibacterial activity.\nAntibiotics entrapped in liposomes significantly enhance their antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic properties and reduce toxic side effects during antibiotic therapy (44, 45). Tobramycin encapsulated in liposomes to treat P. aeruginosa-associated chronic pulmonary infection in mice was more effective due to improved pharmacokinetics, sustained release and accumulation of tobramycin at infection sites, and reduced nephrotoxicity (24). Liposomal amphotericin B, an antifungal agent, is the first liposomal drug launched on the market. Liposomal amphotericin B can reduce the risk of renal toxicity of drugs and can be safely used in antibacterial therapy (25). Consistently, 9-AA(L) improved the antimicrobial effect and reduced the toxicity of 9-AA in our study. The derivatives of 9-AA also showed synergistic antibacterial effects with RIF against sensitive and multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae, which could also be valuable in future studies. In conclusion, 9-AA has the potential to be developed as a new antibacterial agent and adjuvant for RIF. However, before that, structural optimization of these compounds should be performed to improve their efficacy and biosafety.\n\n## Bacterial isolates, media, and reagents.\nThe strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Some of the clinical strains were collected from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Changsha, China). The clinical isolates were identified using a Vitek-2 compact system (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) and a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Unless otherwise stated, these strains were cultured in corresponding media, such as tryptic soy broth (TSB) for Staphylococcus, Luria-Bertani (LB) broth for Gram-negative strains, and brain heart infusion (BHI) for Enterococcus. These media were all purchased from Solarbio (Shanghai, China). Antimicrobials used in this study were obtained from MedChemExpress (NJ, USA) and dissolved in deionized water or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) according to the instructions.\n\n## High-throughput screening.\nTo obtain the potential antimicrobials, a drug library containing 2,049 FDA-approved compounds was selected for three rounds of screening tests. First, 99\u2009\u03bcL of Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth containing 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 CFU/mL K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 with 16\u2009\u03bcg/mL RIF (1/4\u00d7 MIC) was added to a 96-well plate (Corning Costar, USA), and 1\u2009\u03bcL of library compounds was added to the above-described well plates to achieve a final concentration of 100\u2009\u03bcM. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 18 h, the bacterial viability was examined by optical density at 630\u2009nm (OD630) using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad iMark; USA). Compounds with growth inhibition activity greater than 80% compared with the control group were selected for the next screening. Next, a checkerboard assay was conducted, and compounds exhibiting synergy with RIF were selected for final screening. In the last step, the MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of the compounds against K. pneumoniae were determined. Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity of the compounds against normal human cells and tumor cells was also tested by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and hemolysis assay, respectively. Finally, 9-AA was selected for further study (Fig.\u00a01A). The flow chart of the High-throughput screening was plotted using Figdraw.\n\n## Antimicrobial susceptibility test.\nThe MICs and MBCs of 9-AA and RIF were determined by a standard broth microdilution assay according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (46). Briefly, log-phase bacteria were diluted with MH broth to approximately 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL. Next, 50\u2009\u03bcL of the bacterial suspension and 50\u2009\u03bcL of 2-fold serially diluted antimicrobials were added to a 96-well cell plate. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 16 to 18 h, the bacterial turbidity (OD630) was examined using a microplate reader. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration inhibiting measurable bacterial growth. Meanwhile, an aliquot of bacterial suspension from 1\u00d7 MIC was spotted on sheep blood agar plates (AutoBio, Zhengzhou, China), and the MBC was defined as the lowest concentration at which no bacterial colonies grew on the plate after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h.\n\n## Checkerboard assay.\nDrug combinations were assessed by checkerboard assays according to the CLSI guidelines (46). Briefly, 2-fold serial dilutions of the two compounds were prepared in MH broth and added to the columns and rows of a 96-well cell plate. Then, MH broth-diluted bacterial suspensions were added to each well to achieve a final cell density of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 CFU/mL/well. The plates were incubated for 16 to 18 h at 37\u00b0C, and the MICs were measured at OD630 on a microplate reader. The compound interactions were analyzed by the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). The FICI was calculated according to the following equation:\nFICI=MICA(combination)MICA(alone)+MICB(combination)MICB(alone)\nMICs (combination) are the lowest MIC values when combined, and MICs (alone) are the concentrations of compounds A and B when used alone. The FICI was interpreted as follows: FICI\u2009\u2264\u20090.5, synergy; 0.5\u2009<\u2009FICI\u2009\u2264\u20091, partial synergy; 1\u2009<\u2009FICI\u2009\u2264\u20094, indifference; and FICI\u2009>\u20094.0, antagonism (47). In addition, for some mechanism studies, the checkerboard experiments were added with 1.25\u2009mM EDTA or 10\u2009mM Mg2+ before tests.\n\n## Time-kill assay.\nIn a typical assay, bacteria (K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and the clinical isolates of KPWANG or LH2020) were cultured overnight in LB broth at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 180\u2009rpm. The cells were subcultured to the log growth phase in the same broth. The bacterial concentration was adjusted to 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL in fresh MH broth and exposed to RIF and 9-AA alone or in combination. MH broth exposed to 0.1% DMSO served as a control. Viable counts were determined by agar plate counting at the time points of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h.\n\n## Bacterial resistance detection.\nConsecutive and single-step resistance selection was performed to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance-inducing ability of RIF alone or combined with 9-AA against K. pneumoniae. For consecutive resistance selection, briefly, the MIC values of RIF alone or combined with 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL 9-AA against K. pneumoniae were determined using the antimicrobial susceptibility test as described above. Then, cultures from the 1/2\u00d7 MICs were diluted 1:1,000 into fresh MH broth. The diluted bacterial suspensions were continuously used for the second day, and the MICs were measured again and repeated for 25\u2009days. At the end of the experiment, the obtained RIF-resistant strains of the last generation were used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by 9-AA alone or combined with RIF (13). For single-step resistance selection, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 cultures grown overnight were adjusted to an OD630 of 0.5. One hundred microliters of the bacterial suspension was spread evenly onto MH agar plates containing 1\u00d7 MIC RIF alone or combined with sub-MIC 9-AA. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 h, the CFU on the plates were counted, and the frequency of resistance was calculated (48).\n\n## Peptide peptidoglycan competitive inhibition assay.\nThe MICs and time growth curve of 9-AA in the presence of the purified cell wall component PGN were measured as described above in the \u201cAntimicrobial susceptibility test\u201d and \u201cTime-kill assay\u201d sections with minor modifications. Namely, before adding bacterial suspensions, the tested compounds and PGN were preincubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h (49).\n\n## Membrane permeability assay.\nK. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 was grown to log phase, washed, and resuspended in a 0.5 McFarland standard in 5\u2009mM H",
