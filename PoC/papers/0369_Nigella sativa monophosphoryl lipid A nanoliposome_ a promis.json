  "title": "Nigella sativa monophosphoryl lipid A nanoliposome: a promising antibiotic alternative and immunomodulator to control virulent pandemic drug-resistant\u00a0Salmonella pullorum infection in broiler chicks.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serovar Pullorum, the causative agent of pullorum disease, is one cause of the economic losses in the global poultry industry. Vaccination and antibiotics are still the most effective methods of controlling Salmonella, even though the vaccine contains the causative agent, and the antibiotic therapy has limited efficacy. We provide a novel immunostimulator and antibiotic substitute to protect against and avoid Salmonella pullorum (SP) infection. METHODS: Nigella sativa-purified oil (NS) and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) were formulated as nanoliposomal compounds (NS-MPLA). Their protective and immunomodulatory efficacies were experimentally tested orally in broiler chicks against challenge with virulent pandemic drug-resistant SP. Four chick groups were utilized: control; NS-MPLA-supplemented; SP-challenged; and SP-challenged, then NS-MPLA-treated. Clinical signs, organ gross pathology, colony-forming counts, and tissue histopathological alterations were investigated. The relative fold-changes in the expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-17, IL-22, TLR-4, INF-\u03b3, IgA, and MUC2 genes were evaluated. RESULTS: The SP-challenged chicks showed notable symptoms and extensive pathological lesions in their internal organs. The bacteria colonized the challenged chicks' livers and continued to shed in their feces for 5-6\u00a0days. A minor amount of immune cell tissue trafficking was noted. The NS-MPLA-treated chicks displayed opposing patterns after being challenged with SP. They exhibited mild clinical signs with modest gross pathology in the internal organs. After 3-4\u00a0days, the liver and the fecal droppings were cleared of SP. Significant heterophilic aggregation, lymphocytic infiltration, and lymphoid follicle enlargement were observed. Additionally, chicks challenged with SP and then NS-MPLA-treated showed a 5- to tenfold increase in immune-related cytokines, immunoglobulin A, and mucosal relative gene expression folds compared to the SP-challenged non-NS-MPLA-treated, which showed a sharp decline in IL-4 and IL-22 and a minor rise in the rest of the tested gene relative expressions. Chicks given NS-MPLA supplementation showed a significant upregulation of these genes compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: In this first report on poultry, it is possible to draw the conclusion that NS-MPLA supplementation in SP-infected chicks boosts immunity and provides protection. It promoted bacterial clearance and tissue repair and stimulated the expression of genes linked to immunity and the mucosal surface. These findings suggest the potential application of NS-MPLA in salmonella control programs as an antibiotic substitute or in immunization strategies.",

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nSalmonella enterica biovars Pullorum and Gallinarum are responsible for chicken typhoid and pullorum disease, respectively. Pullorum disease, which causes severe symptoms and mortality in its acute stage, is common in poultry [1]. Because the causal agent spreads from the internal organs over months, the chronically infected flock may acquire latent and persistent sickness, even though the adult chickens may not exhibit any signs [2]. Antibiotic treatment of flocks with carrier states is never advised. Purchasing birds free of Salmonella enterica Pullorum, protecting flocks from salmonella infection, and serologic screening of causal agents are the cornerstones of routine breeding flock control. Due to Salmonella's multidrug resistance in developing countries, the majority of Salmonella isolates in those countries are currently at least resistant to three or more antimicrobials [3, 4].\nVaccinating chickens against Salmonella pullorum (abbreviated SP) infections is another efficient way to increase resistance to infection exposure and decrease bacterial shedding. To provide enough defenses against severe SP infections, the attenuated SP ghost vaccine was developed [5]. According to the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, vaccination may or may not be a suitable substitute, depending on the objectives of the control program (eradication or reduction), the type of poultry, the stage of production, the prevalence of Salmonella, the serovars being targeted, the detection techniques, and the cost\u2013benefit analysis [6]. In poultry farming around the world, using antibiotics to prevent disease and promote growth is standard procedure. Antibiotics such as tetracycline, bacitracin, tylosin, and salinomycin are used in industrial poultry production in North America; meanwhile, virginiamycin was often employed [7]. However, food safety and public health may be at risk due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and their human transmission. On January 1, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prevented the use of antibiotics that are significant for human medicine and prohibited them from being used to promote growth or feed efficiency in cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, or other food animals [8]. As a result, it is critical to investigate natural compounds as antibiotic substitutes for the poultry industry.\nIn poultry, Nigella sativa (N. sativa) seed and oil have been utilized as food supplement agents, immunomodulatory agents, and nutritional supplements [9\u201312]. According to the data, N. sativa improved performance and survivability [13], prevented gastric lesions with a stable gastric mucosal redox state [14], lowered intestinal lesion score and caecal morphology in infected broilers [15, 16], and eliminated the additional expenses of antibiotics and other vaccinal preparations with an easy-to-apply administration route. The majority of these studies, however, used N. sativa as crude seed or oil dietary supplements, which were found to have low bioavailability and necessitate high dosages, longer periods of time, and continuous administration in order to achieve the desired effect.\nAccording to extensive research, thymoquinone (TQ), the active ingredient in N. sativa, and its essential oil have a variety of therapeutic benefits, such as antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities. The poor absorption of TQ, hydrophobicity, and N. sativa oil diminished their therapeutic effects. Nanoformulations, or nanoparticles, were therefore suggested. Numerous formulations of nanoparticles were created and delivered by nasal, parenteral, ophthalmic, oral, and other routes. The encapsulation of N. sativa oil, or TQ, into nanoparticle forms improved solubility and absorption, preserved the molecularly dispersed form in the upper gastrointestinal system, and increased protection against harsh, unfavorable conditions through oral ingestion [17\u201320].\nSalmonella enterica endotoxin was used to create monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a toll-like receptor-4 agonist that is a detoxified version of lipid A. The United States Food and Drug Administration authorized MPLA as a safe immunostimulatory adjuvant, and it is currently being used in clinical trials and new commercial vaccines. When administered to mice, it produced significant levels of salivary, plasma, and vaginal immunoglobulin A (IgA)-specific antibodies. It was made with oral immunizing antigen (Streptococcus mutans crude glucosyl transferase) into liposomal membranes (MPLA adjuvant formulation) [21]. It produced a mucosal and systemic cellular immunity that was faster, stronger, and more durable [22\u201325]. In addition to activating macrophages, MPLA also improved cytokines, lymphokines, and T- and B-cell interactions. MPLA was previously employed as a secure non-aluminum vaccine adjuvant. A Th1 or a combined Th1 and Th2-type response was observed in most studies that focused on the quality of the immune response induced in both clinical and non-clinical grade variants of MPLA [26, 27].\nThe existing chicken immunization and/or antibiotic control program has some drawbacks, as reported EFSA [7, 28, 29]. Among these drawbacks are the possibility of microbial resistance to antibiotics, interference with monitoring protocols, and potential human infection with the vaccine-contained microbial strains, in addition to the inability to completely stop microbial shedding or infection with other Salmonellae. This program also requires strong immune protection against non-typhoidal Salmonellae gut colonization, which raises the cost of the vaccines used. Therefore, the development of safe and effective alternatives is required. Recently, the construction of plant-origin potent immunomodulatory compounds against poultry pathogens has gained more attention. In this study, natural, purified N. sativa essential oil (NS) with a bacterial derivative, MPLA, was formulated in nanoliposomal form (NS-MPLA) and experimentally tested in broiler chicks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of NS-MPLA in an experimental study as an antibiotic alternative and immunomodulatory agent against virulent pandemic drug-resistant (PDR) SP infection in poultry.\n\nPurified N. sativa essential oil, NS (cold-pressed seeds), was purchased from Haraz Company for Natural Herbal Products in Egypt. Detoxified monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), produced from Salmonella minnesota Re 595 (Re mutant), was purchased from Sigma Aldrich in St. Louis, MI, USA. Both MPLA and NS were formulated to develop N. sativa-purified oil-detoxified monophosphoryl lipid A (NS-MPLA) nanoliposomes. Here, \"NS-MPLA\" refers to both the developed N. sativa essential oil and the detoxified monophosphoryl lipid A nanoliposomes.\n\n## The NS\nThe procedures of [30, 31] were applied to develop NS-MPLA nanoliposomes encapsulated in chitosan. Using magnetic stirring, a half gram of low molecular weight chitosan (Mwt: 100\u2013300 KDa, Across Co Ltd Company, UK) was dissolved in 50 ml of aqueous acetic acid (2%) to generate solution (A). Then 0.25 g of soy lecithin was dissolved in 25 ml of deionized water and agitated for one hour at 60 \u02daC. Consequently, 0.25 g of pure essential oil (NS) from N. sativa was added to the soy lecithin solution dropwise while stirring. After dissolving 1.0 mg of MPLA in 1.0 ml of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), the MPLA was added to the soy lecithin and NS mixture and agitated dropwise for 30 min to generate solution (B). The aqueous phase of the chitosan solution was homogenized at 15,000 rpm for 15 min after solution B was added drop by drop to solution A to ensure a well-dispersed nanoemulsion of liposomes and hydrophobic molecules. To create a soy lecithin liposome with a nanochitosan shell that compromises both the monophosphoryl detoxified lipid A (MPLA) and N. sativa purified oil (NS), 0.34 g of sodium tripolyphosphate was dissolved in 25 ml of double-deionized water and added to the prepared mixture drop by drop while being gently stirred. The mixture was agitated for 30 min after the sodium tripolyphosphate solution was added, and then it was removed and stored at 4 \u00b0C until it was characterized. It was then utilized either alone or post challenging broiler broiler chicks with SP.\n\n## Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)\nThe produced NS-MPLA nanoliposomes were inspected using a transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOLJEM-2100) to determine their size and distribution. The freshly synthesized suspension of nanoliposomes was placed onto the carbon-coated mesh grid for testing, allowed to air dry completely, and then inspected under the TEM.\n\n## Dynamic light scattering (DLS)\nThe Zeta Sizer (Nano-ZS, Malvern Ltd., UK) was used to determine the size and zeta potential of the prepared NS-MPLA. To guarantee evenly distributed nanoparticles in the aqueous medium, the suspension was subjected to a one-minute sonication. The suspended particles' Brownian motion produced the scattered beams seen in the DLS measurements of the nanoliposomes.\n\n## Isolation and identification of the challenging SP strains\nFrom private broiler farms in the Sharqiah governorate, thirty freshly deceased broilers were brought to the Bacteriology Diagnostic Unit at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt. The chicks' livers and spleens were aseptically dissected to get them ready for bacterial isolation [32]. A loopful of the processed specimens was inoculated into Rappaport\u2013Vassiliadis broth and then cultivated for 48 h at 40 \u00b0C. The established bacterial growth was subcultured onto XLD agar media following the incubation period. API20-E strips were used to detect tiny, transparent, suspicious red colonies [33]. Using these two specific F and R primers, 5\u2032-CAGCGTTTAAGCTGCCAGACCCAG GCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTCGCGACG AAT TTA AAG AGAGCG AAG-3\u2032, respectively, the flhB gene in S. Pullorum/Gallinarum was amplified by conventional PCR in compliance with the methodology of [34]. The SP isolates were further characterized by tests for ornithine decarboxylase, rhamnose consumption, glucose utilization, and absence of motility in indicator motility media. Prior to being employed in the chick challenge and undergoing testing for antibiotic susceptibility, the isolates that were confirmed to be SP were kept at \u221220 \u00b0C.\n\n## Susceptibility testing of SP against NS and antimicrobials\nAs previously reported [35], the disc diffusion method was used to assess the identified SP isolates' susceptibility to both NS and antimicrobials. In brief, a disc of Whatman filter paper coated with 25 \u00b5l of NS soaked in 10% DMSO was adhered to the surface of Muller Hinton agar medium (MHA, Oxoid, UK) after half of McFarland\u2019s density standard of freshly prepared SP suspension (1.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 CFU/mL) had been placed over it. Similarly, the antimicrobial susceptibility of the identified SP strains was determined using a panel of nine antimicrobial discs (Oxoid, UK) that represented different antimicrobial groups and included ampicillin, amoxicillin, doxycycline, colistin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, azithromycin, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and amoxicillin/sodium clavulanate. The SP strains that were verified to be resistant to NS and the nine antimicrobial-tested (pandemic drug-resistant, PDR) strains were used in the chick experimental challenge.\n\n## Experimental design, chicks' management, colonization breakage, and SP challenge\nThis investigation was experimentally designed using one hundred and sixty one-day-old Ross chicks that were Salmonellae-free and purchased from Tiba Company. The chicks were acclimated in a clean environment for 14 days, receiving water and a basic diet devoid of food supplements daily. No antibiotics or other antimicrobials were provided throughout the acclimatization phase. They were further confirmed to be Salmonellae-free on the fifteenth day of their lives after enriching the liver, spleen, and fecal droppings in tetrathionate broth (Neogene, MI, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for six hours, then inoculating 10 \u00b5l of the broth onto Rappaport\u2013Vassiliadis agar and incubating at 41 \u00b0C for twenty-four hours. Ten milligrams of neomycin, five milligrams of vancomycin, ten milligrams of metronidazole, and three milligrams of fluconazole in drinking water were then administered to the chicks for 12 h over the course of two days in order to induce intestinal bacterial colonization breakage and the experimental infection [36]. The chicks were then kept in their cages for an additional twenty-four hours before being randomly distributed to the following four experimental groups:\n\n## Group I (negative control group) \nThe 40 chicks in this group received two divided doses of PBS, separated by 6 h, orally gavaged at a dose of 5.0 ml per chick.\n\n## Group II (NS-MPLA-supplied group)\nThis group's 40 chicks received only oral NS-MPLA (2.5 mg NS oil and 10 ng MPLA for each chick). Two doses (1.0 ml per chick, spaced six hours apart) of the NS-MPLA supplement were administered.\n\n## Group III (SP-challenged group)\nA freshly prepared PDR-SP (108 CFU/ml) suspension was used to induce infection in the chicks (N\u2009=\u200940). The PDR-SP challenge bacteria were administered orally to the chicks in two consecutive doses (1.0 ml per chick, separated by 6 h).\n\n## Group IV (SP-challenged, followed by NS-MPLA treatment group)\nThe 40 chicks of this group were given the challenging SP in the same way as in group III, and then, each bird was given 1.0 ml of NS-MPLA (2.5 mg NS oil and 10 ng MPL per chick) orally in two divided doses, separated by six hours.\nClinical symptoms and gross pathological lesions in internal organs were observed after the chicks were challenged with and/or given NS-MPLA alone as a supplement or as a treatment after the SP challenge. To calculate CFU counts, bacterial isolation was performed on liver and fecal droppings samples from the dying or recently deceased chicks. In order to analyze histological changes in the SP-challenged, NS-MPLA-treated, and NS-MPLA-supplemented chicks following challenge, liver, spleen, and caecum specimens were also collected. To examine IgA, immune-related cytokines, and mucosal-regulating genes, samples were extracted from the caecal tonsils of the four experimental groups.\n\n## Clinical signs\nFollowing the chicks' challenges with the virulent PDR-SP, the clinical symptoms, internal organ lesions, and mortalities were assessed in the four chick groups for two weeks.\n\n## The SP-CFU counts in the chicks' liver tissues and fecal droppings\nThe bacterial counts per gram were calculated by centrifuging the liver and/or fecal dropping samples from the dissected chicks at a low speed (500 rpm) after they had been aseptically homogenized in PBS and sterile sand. The following is an estimate of the SP-CFU counts in the processed samples: Before inoculating Salmonella Shigella agar or Rappaport\u2013Vassiliadis agar plates, 10 \u00b5L of the sample supernatants were ten-fold serially diluted in sterile PBS. The plates were inspected, and the SP-CFU counts were calculated using the previously described method [32] following a 48-h incubation period at 41 \u00b0C.\n\n## Histopathological alterations\nThe liver, caecum, and spleen specimens were kept in 10% neutral buffered formalin after being dissected from chicks that were SP-challenged and subsequently NS-MPLA-treated, as well as chicks that were SP-challenged. Following the standard procedure, 5 \u00b5m tissue slices were sectioned, paraffin-prepared, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin in order to perform microscopic investigations [37].\n\n## RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis\nFollowing the mentioned references [38\u201340], the primers listed in Table 1 were used to determine the expression of the immune-related cytokines, immunoglobulin A, and mucosal genes in the cecal tonsils on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 of the four tested chick groups. Following the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was extracted from the cecal tissues using the Trizol TM method (Invitrogen, USA). The amount and quality of extracted RNA were assessed at 260 and 280 nm using a UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer. To rule out any genomic DNA contamination, the DNase treatment was carried out using the DNase1 kit (Sigma, USA). cDNA synthesis was performed using the Thermo Scientific Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Lithuania), and every sample had the same RNA concentration (1.5 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) in each of the cecal tissue samples that were collected from the tested chicks.\nTable 1Primers used in real-time quantitative PCRTarget genePrimer sequenceReference\u03b2-actinF-5'-CATCAGGGAGTCATGGTCGGCA-3\u2019R-5'GCATACAGGTCTTTACGGATGTCC-3'Gene bankJQ086312IL-17F-5\u2019-ATGGGAAGGTGATACGGC-3\u2019R-5\u2019 GATGGGCACGGAGTTGA-3Gene bankAM773756IL-22F-5'-GCACCTACACCTTGGCTGAA-3\u2019R-5'TGTAGCAGCGGTTGTTCTCC-3\u2019GenBank: AJ617782.1IFN-\u03b3F-5'-GTGAAGAAGGTGAAAGATATCATGGA-3'R-5'-GCTTTGCGCTGGATTCTCA-3'[38][38]IL-1\u03b2F-5'-CAGCCTCAGCGAAGAGACCTT-3'R-5'-CACTGTGGTGTGCTCAGAATCC-3'IL-4F-5'-AATGACATCCAGGGAGAGGTTTC-3'R-5'-AGGCTTTGCATAAGAGCTCAGTTT-3'[39]TLR-4F-5'-TGTGCTGGAAAAAGCTGCAC-3'R-5'-AGCTTTGTCTCACGGGTCAC-3'Gene bank, KP410249.1MUC-2F: 5'-CAGCACCAACTTCTCAGTTCC-3'R:5'-TCTGCAGCCACACATTCTTT-3'[40][40]IgAF: 5'-ACCACGGCTCTGACTGTACC-3'R: 5'-CGATGGTCTCCTTCACATCA-3'\nF forward, R reverse, \u03b2-actin cytoskeletal structural protein, MUC-2 mucin-2, IgA immunoglobulin A, INF-\u03b3 interferon- \u03b3, IL-1\u03b2 interleukin 1\u03b2, IL-4 interleukin 4, TLR-4\u00a0toll-like receptor-4\n\n## Quantitation of mRNA expression\nTarget chick genes were measured for mRNA expression levels using quantitative real-time PCR, or qRT-PCR. As directed by the manufacturer, the QuantiTect SYBR Green fluorescent dye one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and the Mx3000P real-time qPCR device (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used to measure the level of gene expression. The studied gene expression was normalized by using \u03b2-actin as an internal control. The 2\u2009\u2212\u2009\u0394\u0394CT comparative approach was used to determine the relative amount of the expressed gene mRNA [41]. \u0394\u0394CT was used to depict the difference between the CT measurements for the mRNA level of each tissue and the CT measurements for the mRNA level of the reference gene. \u0394CT (sample control) is equal to CT (target gene) minus mean CT (\u03b2-Actin).\n\n## Statistical analysis\nThe mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of CFU counts and immune-related and mucosal-regulating genes was analyzed by analysis of variance in the different experimental groups. The data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\n## NS-MPLA morphology and distribution\nAs seen in Figs. 1a and b, TEM was used to assess the morphology of the developed nanocapsules. The resulting nanoparticles were dark and semi-spherical (Fig. 1a). Within the capsules, the encapsulated MPLA is located in a dark area. The particles, which ranged in size from 10 to 45 nm on average, exhibited some aggregation and an interconnected structure, as is typical of NS-MPLA chitosan nanoparticles (Fig. 1b).Fig. 1 a and b: TEM images of the synthesized nanoliposomes at two different locations. The nanoliposomes are dark gray and semispherical in shape (a) with some dark black aggregates (a). The sizes of the nanoliposomes 10-45 nm (b)\n\n## NS-MPLA nanoliposomes zeta potential\nAs shown in Supplementary Data 1a and b, DLS was used to analyze the synthesized NS-MPLA's size and charges. The nanoliposomes had a size of about 28.5 nm, making them comparatively monodisperse (supplementary data 1a). A big peak with a positive value of 8.24 mV and a little peak with a negative value of \u22125.36 mV were observed in the zeta potential (supplementary data 1b).\n\nSix strains were confirmed as SP following culture, biochemical, and genetic identification. Only one SP strain exhibited resistance to both NS and the tested antimicrobials (PDR strain) when tested against the nine antimicrobials and NS (Figs. 2a and b). The remaining five strains exhibited resistance to the NS and to at least four of the tested antimicrobials (multidrug-resistant). The PDR-SP strain was used for the chick challenges (groups III and IV).Fig. 2a and b: Antimicrobials and N. sativa purified oil susceptibilities of the S. Pullorum challenging strain. In the disc diffusion, the tested SP strain showed pandemic resistance to the nine tested antimicrobials (a) and to the purified N. sativa oil (b).

Prolonged SP fecal shedding was seen in the chicks in group III that were challenged with SP. SP remained in the feces for 4\u20135 days and in the liver for 3\u20134 days, as seen in Table 2. The SP challenged chicks that were subsequently treated with NS-MPLA (group IV) had a high level of bacteria (6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0.45\u2009\u00d7\u2009108) at day 1, which was completely eliminated from the liver tissues and fecal droppings by day 4 and day 5, respectively, but the bacteria remained in the fecal droppings of the SP-challenged chicks, group III (Table 2 and Supplementary Data 2a-d). By the sixth to the fifteenth day, neither the liver tissues nor the feces showed any signs of bacterial shedding in both group III and group IV (Table 2).\nTable 2S. pullorum colony-forming unit counts in the chicks fecal droppings and liver tissues of SP-challenged and the SP-challenged, followed by NS-MPLA treatment at different time intervalsTimeFecal droppingsLiver tissuesSP-challengedSP-challenged, then NS-MPLA-treatedSP-challengedNS-MPLA treatedpost-SP challenge1st d1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091086.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0.45\u2009\u00d7\u20091080.00.02nd d1.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009\u00d7\u20091083.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u2009\u00d7\u20091080.00.03rd d4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009\u00d7\u20091064.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009\u00d7\u20091083.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009\u00d7\u20091043.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5\u2009\u00d7\u20091024th d6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3\u2009\u00d7\u20091038.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75\u2009\u00d7\u20091062.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.35\u2009\u00d7\u20091040.05th d1.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.25\u2009\u00d7\u20091030.00.00.06th \u221215thd0.0d day, SP\u00a0S. pullorum,\u00a0NS-MPLA\u00a0N. sativa-purified oil-monophosphoryl lipid A nanoliposomes\n\n## Clinical symptoms in the SP-challenged chick groups\nThe experimental challenge of the chicks (groups III and IV) was conducted using the confirmed SP-PDR strain, and the clinical signs were observed for 15 days following the SP challenge and NS-MPLA administration. As seen in Fig. 3a, the SP-challenged chicks in group III exhibited clinical symptoms on the second and third days after the challenge, which included depression, dullness, drooping wings, neck stretching, anorexia, unwillingness to move, and white fecal droppings. Growing weakness, anorexia, ruffled feathers, falling of wings, and lowering of the head were all observed in the second week post-challenge. As shown in Fig. 3b, the opposite scenario was observed in the SP-challenged, then NS-MPLA-treated chicks (Group IV), with non-significant clinical symptoms at day 3\u20134 post-challenge (2\u20133 days post-NS-MPLA treatment). The chicks in the same group (IV) showed mild clinical symptoms starting in the third day and continued for only one day post-treatment with NS-MPLA. The chicks, who were given NS-MPLA alone (group II), were healthy and physically fit; there were no deaths or health issues reported (data not shown).\nFig. 3 a and b: The clinical signs in the SP-challenged chicks and those NS-MPLA treated post-SP challenge. The SP-challenged chicks (a) exhibited a dropped head (1), stretched neck (2), and an inability to move (3) with watery fecal droppings (4), while the SP-challenged, then NS-MPLA-treated chicks (b) showed the opposite view\n\n## Internal organ lesions\nAs shown in Fig. 4 (a-g), prominent internal organ prominent lesions (intestine, liver, and spleen) were observed in the chicks that were challenged with the SP. Dark fecal contents, gas-filled swelling, congestion, and bleeding patches were all seen in the gut. Additionally, the cecal tonsils were diminished. Furthermore, the liver displayed mottling, and the spleen was enlarged and congested. In contrast, the NS-MPLA-treated chicken post SP-challenge showed mild internal organ lesions with enlargement in their cecal tonsils (Figs. 4 (h-n).\nFig. 4(a-n): Internal organ pathological lesions in chicks SP-challenged (1) and SP-challenged, followed by NS-MPLA treatment (2). The SP-challenged chicks (a\u2013g) showed signs of congested hemorrhagic liver with mottled appearance (a, light blue arrow), congested distended bowel (b, white arrow), dark intestinal contents (c, dark blue arrow), petechial hemorrhage (d, yellow arrow) or patchy bloody spots (e, red arrows), small diminished cecal tonsils (f, green arrow), and an enlarged congested spleen (g, light green arrow). Following the SP challenge and subsequent NS-MPLA treatment (h-n), the chicks displayed modest intestinal changes (i-l), cecal tonsil enlargement (m, light blue arrows), and an apparently normal liver and spleen (h and n, light brown and light gray arrows, respectively)\n\n## Liver, caecum, and spleen immunohistopathological alterations\na. Liver\nThere were noticeable differences in the liver tissues of the studied chicks, according to the histopathology sections that were examined. Significant changes were seen in the liver of the SP-challenged chicks (group III), including hepatic parenchyma expansion and blood vessel congestion along with portal leukocyte aggregation, mostly of mononuclear cells (Fig. 5L1, Table 3). The liver tissues of the chicks that were given NS-MPLA after being challenged with SP (group IV) displayed hyperplastic Kupffer cell enlargement along with intense portal heterophilic lymphocytic aggregates and parenchyma that appeared to be normal. No hepatic degenerations were found (Fig. 5L2, Table 3). At the same time, Kupffer cell hyperplasia and seemingly normal portal heterophilic and/or lymphoid plasmocytic aggregates were seen in the chicks supplemented with NS-MPLA (group II) (Table 3).\nTable 3Pathological alterations in the chicks liver of NS-MPLA-supplied, SP-challenged, and those SP-challenged, then NS-MPLA-treated at different time intervalsOrganPathologic alterationsNS-MPLA supplied (Group II)SP-challenged (Group III)NS-MPLA treated post-SP challenge (Group IV)1d2d3d4d1d5d9d13d1d2d5d9d13dLiverHydrobic degeneration----++++-+++---Lympho plasmo-cytic infiltration++++++++++++++++++++++++++Periportal Heterophilic aggregations--++++--++-++++++++++++Kupffer cell hypertrophy++++++++++++-+++++++++++Focal biliray proliferation--------++++-d day, SP S. pullorum, NS-MPL\nN. sativa- monophosphoryl lipid A nanoliposomes\nFig. 5Histological changes in the liver (L), caecum (C), and spleen (S) of chicks challenged with SP and those challenged with SP and then treated with NS-MPLA. The sections from the liver (L1, L2), spleen (S1, S2), and caecum (C1, C2) were included. The SP-challenged chicks provided the C1, L1, and S1 sections, while the SP-challenged chicks that subsequently received NS-MPLA treatment provided the C2, L2, and S2 sections. The NS-MPLA-treated chicks' hepatic tissues (L2) displayed intense portal heterophilic and lymphocytic aggregates (light blue arrow) with hyperplastic Kupffer cells and heterophilic cell trafficking (black and green arrows), whereas the hepatic tissues of those SP-challenged chicks (L1) displayed mild portal leukocyte aggregates (light blue arrow) and parenchymal swelling with clogged blood vessels (red arrow). In contrast, the cecal tissues of the chicks treated with NS-MPLA after the challenge (C2) showed lymphocytic infiltration (black and light blue arrows), a normal mucosal surface (C2), and identifiable heterophilic cells, mostly mononuclear cells. A denuded surface (black arrow) and mucosal injury with modest heterophilic and lymphocytic infiltration (green and light blue arrows) were observed in the chicks challenged with SP (C1). The white pulps of the SP-challenged and NS-MPLA-treated chicks (S2) showed intensely determined hyperplasia and histiocytic proliferations (black and red arrows); the low splenic white pulps of the SP-challenged chicks (S1) showed proliferative reticulo-endothelial cells (histiocytes), and mild heterophilic infiltration was seen in the depleted splenic white pulps (light blue and red arrows) of SP-challenged chicks (S1). H&E X 400 arrows\nb. Caecum\nThe cecal tissues of the SP-challenged (group III) and treated (group IV) chicks showed clear differences in the histopathological sections that were analyzed. Figure 5C1 and Table 4 demonstrate the presence of cecal tissue injury in the SP-challenged chicks. Thickened lamina propria, a denuded enterocyte surface, slight lymphocytic and heterophilic infiltration, submucosal edema, and moderate hyperplasia with proliferative intestinal glands were all examples of this injury. Beginning on the first day of infection and continuing for nine days, the SP-challenged chicks showed signs of lymphoid tissue loss (Table 4). The cecal tissues of group IV treated with NS-MPLA after the SP-challenge showed villi epithelial lining reconstitution, with notable heterophilic and lymphocytic infiltration in the mucosa and intense heterophilic infiltration. Table 4 and Fig. 5C2 indicate that the cecal tissues of the group IV treated with NS-MPLA after the SP-challenge showed reconstitution of the villi epithelial lining, an intense hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles with an intact epithelial surface, and significant heterophilic and lymphocytic infiltration in the mucosa and intestinal glands. These findings persisted for at least 13 days. The chicks were supplemented with NS-MPLA. Along with proliferative intestinal glands, the chicks supplemented with NS-MPLA (group II) displayed a notable hyperplasia of submucosal lymphoid follicles in the cecal wall. This was associated with mucosal lymphocytic and/or heterophilic infiltration (Table 4).\nTable 4Pathological alterations in the chicks caecum of NS-MPLA-supplied, SP-challenged, and those SP-challenged, then NS-MPLA-treated at different time intervals",
