  "full_text": "## INTRODUCTION\nThe dramatic increase in drug-resistant pathogens, in particular the emergence of superbugs, has seriously threatened public health (1, 2). Gram-positive drug-resistant pathogens remain among the top causes of health care-associated infections, and therefore are a high priority in drug development research (3, 4). Especially, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common opportunistic human bacterial pathogens and causes serious infections, including suppurative infections, pneumonia, and sepsis (5\u20138). The development of novel and efficient strategies to treat infectious diseases caused by Gram-positive pathogens has become an urgent task.\nCompared with traditional development approaches, drug repurposing provides a faster and more effective approach to identify new antimicrobial agents (9, 10). Most repurposed drugs already have detailed information about safety and pharmacokinetic profiles available, which reduces the research cost and shortens the development period, thereby accelerating their application in clinical treatment (11). Some compounds approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as the antifungal naftifine, antispasmodic otilonium bromide, and antirheumatic auranofin, have been reported as inhibitors of Gram-positive bacterial infections (12\u201315). However, these drugs are not reported to have broad-spectrum antimicrobial or antibacterial effects on clinically isolated multidrug-resistant strains. Thus, there are currently very few repurposed drugs that can be used to inhibit clinical bacterial strains.\nTo find more efficient antibacterial compounds, we screened FDA-approved drugs and found that crizotinib exhibited antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacteria. Crizotinib is a novel orally active multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits anaplastic lymphoma kinase, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, and the receptor \u201crecepteur d'origine nantais.\u201d It is a reversible competitive inhibitor against ATP binding to the intracellular catalytic domain of these oncogenic tyrosine kinases (16, 17). However, the detailed antibacterial properties and antibacterial mechanisms of crizotinib are unknown.\nHere, we found that the repurposed drug crizotinib showed good antibacterial activity against bacteria, including Gram-positive bacteria, which cannot easily develop drug resistance to it. Furthermore, it showed antibacterial synergy with clindamycin (Cli) and gentamicin (Gent). In an animal model, crizotinib increased the survival rate and reduced pulmonary inflammation in mice. Subsequently, data-independent acquisition (DIA) quantitative proteomics coupled with drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) showed that crizotinib exerted its antibacterial effects by targeting PyrG, thereby interfering with pyrimidine metabolism and eventually disrupting DNA synthesis. Therefore, our study suggests a promising antibacterial drug with a detailed mechanism of action that may contribute to the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections in the future.\n\n## Crizotinib showed good antimicrobial activity and avoided bacterial resistance.\nTo find novel antibacterial agents, a drug library of 288 FDA-approved medications was tested for antibacterial activity. S. aureus Newman was treated with the 288 compounds individually at an identical concentration of 30\u2009\u03bcM for 12 h, and the inhibitory effects on bacteria were evaluated by determining the optical density at 600 nm (OD600). As shown in Fig.\u00a01A, crizotinib, a novel orally active multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was one of the most potent compounds in suppressing S. aureus Newman.\nTo assess the antibacterial spectrum of crizotinib, we measured the MIC of crizotinib against several pathogens commonly found in clinical settings. We found that crizotinib significantly inhibited the growth of multiple Gram-positive pathogens, including S. aureus, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs of 9 to 26\u2009\u03bcg/mL, but had little effect on Gram-negative bacteria (Fig.\u00a01B). Moreover, crizotinib also hindered the growth of various single-antibiotic-resistant S. aureus strains, including ciprofloxacin-resistant (Cipr) strain ATCC 29213, methicillin-resistant (Metr) strain ATCC 29213 (MRSA-29213), clindamycin-resistant (Clir) strain ATCC 29213, and gentamicin-resistant (Gentr) S. aureus strains, with MICs of 9 to 18\u2009\u03bcg/mL (Fig.\u00a01C). More importantly, it efficiently suppressed several clinically isolated multidrug-resistant strains of E. faecalis, S. aureus, and S. haemolyticus, with MICs of 15 to 38\u2009\u03bcg/mL (Fig.\u00a01D). These results suggest that crizotinib has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive pathogens, even for clinically isolated multidrug-resistant bacteria.\nFurthermore, we used a representative Gram-positive bacterium, S. aureus Newman, as a model to investigate the antibacterial activity and mechanism of action for crizotinib. The growth curves of S. aureus Newman showed that the bacterial growth rate decreased in a dose-dependent manner with crizotinib (Fig.\u00a01E). Based on the principle that more proteins are detected in bacteria, 0.5\u00d7 the MIC of crizotinib was chosen for the subsequent proteomics assay in this study.\nMoreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe changes in bacterial morphology after crizotinib treatment. The SEM images showed that the cells in the control group had an intact structure and a smooth surface (Fig.\u00a01F). In contrast, the cell structure of S. aureus treated with crizotinib was significantly disrupted (Fig.\u00a01G). The results showed that crizotinib treatment damaged the cell structure of S. aureus.\nThe drug resistance of bacteria is also an important index to judge whether an antibacterial drug has potential for clinical application. Therefore, we tested the resistance development of S. aureus against crizotinib. S. aureus Newman was cultured in the presence of sub-MIC values of crizotinib and ampicillin (Amp [positive control]). The fold change in the MIC showed that bacteria had a low tendency for development of drug resistance to crizotinib from the first passage to the 20th passage (Fig.\u00a01H). Contrastingly, the bacteria exhibited a 120-fold increase in the Amp MIC after approximately 20 passages. Therefore, compared with commonly used antibiotics, crizotinib has a greater advantage in avoiding bacterial drug resistance.\nUsing combinational therapy for antibiotics is an important method for the clinical treatment of mixed bacterial infections, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, and severe infections (18). To achieve better antibacterial efficacy, the commonly used antibiotics such as Gent, Amp, erythromycin (Erm), and Cli were combined with crizotinib to test the antibacterial effect. The results showed that the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) values of crizotinib combined with antibiotics, including Cli and Gent, were\u2009\u22640.5 for S. aureus Newman. These results illustrated that crizotinib with Cli or Gent had a synergistic antibacterial effect (Fig.\u00a01I).\n\n## Crizotinib has a protective antibacterial effect \nTo further evaluate the antibacterial effect of crizotinib in vivo, a mouse model of S. aureus MRSA-166138 was established. In the analysis of mouse survival rates, the median lethal dose of the MRSA-166138 strain was 1\u2009\u00d7\u20091010 CFU in a mouse pneumonia model. After 5 days of observation, crizotinib treatment significantly improved the survival rate of mice infected with MRSA-166138 (Fig.\u00a02A). This survival analysis illustrated that the crizotinib-treated group had a significant survival advantage over the vehicle-treated control group (mice infected with 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] and phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]).\nThe subsequent assay evaluating bacterial load showed results consistent with the survival rate analysis. As shown in Fig.\u00a02B, in the vehicle-treated group, where the vehicle contained DMSO (<0.5% [vol/vol]), the bacterial load in the lungs of the mice was approximately 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 CFU/mouse. However, after 48 h of crizotinib treatment, the bacterial load was reduced to only 1.3\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 CFU/mouse, showing an obvious inhibitory effect on the invasion of lung tissue by the MRSA-166138 strain. Furthermore, histopathological examination revealed that the lung tissue of the vehicle-treated group was markedly hyperemic, with a large number of inflammatory cells accumulated in the alveoli. After crizotinib treatment, the number of inflammatory cells was significantly decreased, and the structure of alveoli became relatively complete, suggesting that pulmonary inflammation was alleviated (Fig.\u00a02C). Consistent with these findings, computed tomography (CT) image analysis revealed a significantly smaller shadow in the lungs of the crizotinib-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group (Fig.\u00a02D).\nMoreover, to further characterize the potential of crizotinib as an antibacterial agent, the safety of crizotinib was also assessed by histopathological examination of the liver and kidney. Treatment with crizotinib did not change the cellular morphology of either the liver or kidney (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, no obvious difference in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed between the crizotinib treatment and control groups, indicating that crizotinib has low toxicity in mice (Fig.\u00a02F). Taken together, these results indicate that crizotinib has potential as an antibacterial agent with strong antibacterial efficacy and reliable in vivo safety.\n\n## DIA-based quantitative proteomics analysis of the antibacterial mechanism of crizotinib.\nTo investigate the potential antibacterial mechanism of crizotinib against S. aureus, DIA-based quantitative proteomics was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between the control and groups treated with 0.5\u00d7 the MIC of crizotinib for 1 h and 2 h. The power law global error model (PLGEM) algorithm was used to assess the proteomic data for the DEPs. The protein abundance of the 1-h group and 2-h group was analyzed with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.92 and adjusted R2 values of 0.998 and 0.996, respectively (Fig.\u00a03A), validating of the reliability of our quantitative proteomics data.\nIn total, 1,511 and 1,354 proteins were quantified in the 1-h and 2-h groups, respectively. As shown in volcano plots, the change tendency of the DEPs had similar distributions in the 1-h and 2-h groups (Fig.\u00a03B), and 450 and 529 DEPs were identified in the 1-h and 2-h groups, respectively. A total of 189 DEPs were shared between the two groups. In the 1-h group, 203 upregulated and 247 downregulated proteins were identified, while 215 upregulated and 314 downregulated proteins were found in the 2-h treatment group (Fig.\u00a03C and D). To analyze the mechanism of action of crizotinib, DEPs were subjected to further bioinformatics analysis.\nKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of these DEPs showed that some pathways were continuously downregulated with crizotinib treatment, including fatty acid biosynthesis and pyrimidine, propanoate, and pyruvate metabolism. In the 1-h treatment group, 0.5\u00d7 the MIC of crizotinib caused downregulation of glycolysis, the purine, methane, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways, and oxidative phosphorylation. Pathways involved in bacterial survival, such as ribosome, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolisms, as well as S. aureus infectivity, were significantly downregulated in the 2-h treatment group (Fig.\u00a03E).\nInterestingly, the DIA-based proteomics data showed that the upregulation of five proteins (NWMN_1263, CitC, SucB, SdhC, and CitZ) involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and downregulation of two key proteins (PycA and IpdA) responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) occurred simultaneously after crizotinib treatment (Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a04A). Then, the quantification result showed that the amount of intracellular acetyl-CoA significantly decreased in crizotinib-treated bacteria (Fig.\u00a04B). Meanwhile, NWMN_1263, CitC, SucB, SdhC, and CitZ, involved in the TCA cycle, were simultaneously increased in crizotinib-treated bacteria, which may need more ATP to resist the stimulation of drug. However, the ATP level in these bacteria was also decreased (Fig.\u00a04C). Therefore, we speculated that crizotinib treatment interfered with bacterial growth by decreasing substrate material (acetyl-CoA) production and resulting in low ATP production of the TCA cycle, even though the key enzymes in TCA cycle were increased.\nMore importantly, the proteomics data showed that proteins PyrC, PyrD, PyrF, PyrE, PyrB, etc., involved in pyrimidine metabolism, were simultaneously downregulated after crizotinib treatment, which may lead to decline of pentose phosphate and glutamine conversion to DNA (Table\u00a01 and Fig.\u00a04D). The real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results confirmed that the mRNA expression levels of the genes encoding the above-mentioned proteins were also downregulated to different extents (Fig.\u00a04E). We further measured the DNA content of S. aureus Newman by flow cytometry using the fluorescent dye 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI). The calculated mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) showed a decrease in DNA content in S. aureus upon 0.5\u00d7 the MIC crizotinib exposures compared to that in the control group (Fig.\u00a04F and G). Therefore, crizotinib interferes with pyrimidine metabolism to decrease DNA synthesis and thus inhibits bacterial growth.\n\n## Crizotinib directly targets PyrG to disrupt pyrimidine metabolism pathway.\nGiven the efficient antibacterial effect of crizotinib, we further identified the potential target of crizotinib in S. aureus using DARTS technology (Fig.\u00a05A). After pronase digestions for 15\u2009min and 20\u2009min, a band with a size of approximately 59\u2009kDa was increased in the crizotinib-treated cell lysates from S. aureus Newman, compared to that in untreated bacteria, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a05B). The protein band was identified as PyrG using mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. We further confirmed the binding of crizotinib to PyrG with DARTS, thermal stability, and biolayer interferometry (BLI). Crizotinib supplementation was shown to improve the resistance of PyrG to pronase digestion (Fig.\u00a05C), and PyrG incubated with crizotinib showed higher thermal stability than the control (Fig.\u00a05D). Furthermore, BLI revealed crizotinib binds to PyrG in a dose-dependent manner with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD)\u2009of 8.92\u2009\u03bcM (Fig.\u00a05E). These results jointly illustrated that crizotinib can directly bind to PyrG in vitro with high affinity.\nTo further validate this drug target in vivo, we attempted to knock out pyrG in S. aureus Newman several times, but failed. However, we found that S. aureus and S. pneumoniae were closely related (Fig.\u00a05F), and crizotinib also exhibited good antibacterial activity against S. pneumoniae D39 (Fig.\u00a01B). Fortunately, our group has a successful gene knockout model of S. pneumoniae D39. Therefore, pyrG was deleted in S. pneumoniae D39, and subsequently the antibacterial effect of crizotinib on S. pneumoniae D39 growth was evaluated. The results indicated that the inhibition efficiency of crizotinib against S. pneumoniae D39 \u0394pyrG was lower than that against S. pneumoniae D39 (Fig.\u00a05G). What\u2019s more, to validate the drug target sites in PyrG, pyrG and pyrGG18A K39A E141A D305A were introduced into D39 \u0394pyrG. The inhibition efficiency of crizotinib against D39 \u0394pyrG::pyrGG18A K39A E141A D305A was also lower than that against D39 \u0394pyrG::pyrG, further confirming that the crizotinib binding site of PyrG is composed of Gly18, Lys39, Glu141, and Asp305 (Fig.\u00a05H).\nThese combined data further confirmed that crizotinib can directly target the key protein of CTP synthase, PyrG, in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. Coincidently, the above proteomics data also showed that crizotinib interferes with pyrimidine metabolism and eventually disturbs DNA synthesis. Therefore, we tried to use cytidine-5\u2032-triphosphate disodium salt (CTP) to reverse bacterial growth. A series of CTP concentrations were added to S. aureus Newman treated with 0.5\u00d7 the MIC of crizotinib. The OD600 values indicated that CTP efficiently promoted bacterial growth (Fig.\u00a05I). Thus, both in vitro and in vivo data indicate that crizotinib inhibits Gram-positive bacteria by hindering pyrimidine metabolism through targeting PyrG.\nTo further determine the binding mode of crizotinib and PyrG in detail, we carried out molecule docking (MD) with University of California\u2014San Francisco (UCSF) Dock 6.9. The poses with the lowest binding free energy and the highest scoring orientation were selected for further analysis. The MD results revealed that the hydrogen atom of crizotinib directly binds to the amino group and carbonyl groups of PyrG through hydrogen bonding interactions with Gly18, Lys39, Glu141, and Asp305 of PyrG (Fig.\u00a06A). To further verify the importance of these four residues in the binding of PyrG with crizotinib, we mutated all these residues to alanine simultaneously to eliminate the hydrogen bond between PyrG and crizotinib. A subsequent BLI assay suggested that the mutant protein PyrGG18A K39A E141A D305A did not interact with crizotinib (Fig.\u00a06B). Taken together, our data verified that Gly18, Lys39, Glu141, and Asp305 are important for PyrG binding to crizotinib.\nTo investigate the change in PyrG conformation upon crizotinib binding, we performed molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) with the initial conformation of the PyrG and PyrG-crizotinib postdock complex for 100\u2009ns. Generally, most residues of PyrG showed higher root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values than those of the PyrG-crizotinib complex (Fig.\u00a06C), indicating that crizotinib binding results in a compact structure of PyrG. Interestingly, the amino acid distance on both sides of the ATP binding pocket in the PyrG-crizotinib complex was significantly smaller than that in PyrG, including for Ala242 and Lys17 or Asp243 and Gly18 (Fig.\u00a06D and E). In the PyrG structure, there is a smaller solvent-accessible surface to bind ATP. We further visualized the hydrophobic surface by PyMOL and found that the ATP binding pocket was almost completely closed in the PyrG-crizotinib complex, while it remained accessible in PyrG, with a volume of 265.903 \u00c53 (Fig.\u00a06F and G). This result suggests that crizotinib binding may lead to decreased ATP binding ability of PyrG. Subsequent fluorescence titration showed that ATP titration caused a significant fluorescence quenching of PyrG at around 335\u2009nm, with a KD of 320\u2009\u03bcM. Contrastingly, hardly any change in the fluorescence intensity of the PyrG-crizotinib complex was observed (Fig.\u00a06H and I). This result was consistent with the observation from MD analysis that indicated that crizotinib binding resulted in the disappearance of the ATP binding pocket. Because ATP is the necessary substrate for PyrG to produce CTP in pyrimidine metabolism, these results may indicate that crizotinib binding to PyrG may lead to the inability to function in pyrimidine metabolism, resulting in the reduction of CTP production.\n\n## DISCUSSION\nBacterial infection is an intractable complication in patients (19\u201321). S. aureus strains, especially MRSA, are often the main pathogen of clinical infection and have high incidence and mortality worldwide (22, 23). Abuse of antibiotics has led to a rapid increase in the number and type of drug-resistant bacteria, especially the emergence of superbugs, which has made it critical for the development of novel and more effective strategies to treat bacterial infections (24, 25).\nDrug repurposing has been a research hot spot in the field of antibacterial drug discovery, providing a faster and more effective approach to identify new antimicrobial agents. Here, we found that the repurposed drug crizotinib, an FDA-certified novel oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could inhibit Gram-positive bacteria with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, but scarcely had antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, which might be a result of the differences in the composition and structure of the cell wall. The unique structure and component of outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria have selective permeability to molecules, thus reducing the sensitivity of bacteria to certain drugs. Our study provides evidence that crizotinib not only exhibits a strong antibacterial effect against sensitive Gram-positive and single-antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but also has a strong effect against clinically isolated multidrug-resistant bacteria. In addition, the animal model results showed that after treatment with crizotinib, the survival rate of mice with pneumonia increased significantly, and the pulmonary inflammation of the crizotinib-treated group was obviously reduced compared with that of the vehicle-treated mice. These results suggest that crizotinib has a high antibacterial efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Because of its antimicrobial and anticancer effects, it may be suitable for the treatment of lung cancer patients with infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria.\nCrizotinib shows significant antimicrobial effects against clinical isolate strains with multiple-antibiotic-resistance phenotypes, implying that the action mechanism of crizotinib is unique compared to that of traditional antibiotics. DIA-based quantitative proteomics and biochemical verification revealed that crizotinib treatment leads to a reduction in ATP production by hindering the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, limiting the availability of acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle. Crizotinib treatment also disturbs pyrimidine metabolism and eventually reduces DNA synthesis. Meanwhile, in DARTS, BLI, and thermal stability assays, we found and validated the target protein of crizotinib, PyrG, which is a key CTP synthase. PyrG uses ATP as the substrate and is involved in pyrimidine metabolism, which is an important pathway for DNA synthesis (19). This antibacterial mechanism is unique compared to available antibiotics, which may explain why S. aureus exhibited low resistance to crizotinib during the process of serial passages. Moreover, a previous study has also reported that PyrG is a drug target of thiophene carboxamide derivatives to inhibit the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (20). These results suggest that PyrG may be a target for antibacterial drugs to inhibit bacteria.\nFurthermore, MD and site-direct mutagenesis suggest that Gly18, Lys39, Glu141, and Asp305 are important residues for binding to crizotinib via hydrogen bond formation. MDS analysis showed that crizotinib binding to PyrG results in closing of the ATP binding pocket of PyrG, which causes loss of ATP binding ability and function in CTP production of PyrG. Understanding the mechanism is beneficial for the design of antibacterial drugs.\nIn conclusion, we found that the repurposed drug crizotinib showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial effect against Gram-positive bacteria, even for clinically isolated multidrug-resistant bacteria. Crizotinib suppresses bacterial growth by disrupting CTP production in pyrimidine metabolism via targeting the CTP synthase PyrG, thus resulting in the closure of the ATP binding pocket of PyrG, causing loss of ATP binding ability and therefore loss of function (Fig.\u00a07). Our study provides a preclinical rationale for the development of crizotinib for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.\n\n## Bacterial strains and growth conditions.\nThe FDA-approved drug library and crizotinib were purchased from TargetMol (Shanghai, China) and dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 5\u2009mg/mL as a stock solution stored at \u221220\u00b0C. The antibiotics were purchased from Sigma (United States). The clinically isolated strains were collected from patients admitted to the affiliated Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University (Guangzhou). The bacterial strains, including P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and S. aureus ATCC 29213, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. S. aureus Newman, multiple-drug-resistant S. aureus 43300 (MRSA-43300), S. suis BM407, L. monocytogenes 19117, S. pneumoniae D39, and S. pyogenes MGAS5005 were stored at our laboratory. Cipr, Metr, Clir, and Gentr strains were domesticated by our laboratory. S. aureus, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, and S. suis BM407 strains were grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium (Huankai, China), L. monocytogenes 19117 was cultured in brain heart infusion broth (Hopebio, China) at 37\u00b0C at 200\u2009rpm. S. pneumoniae D39 and S. pyogenes MGAS5005 were cultured in Todd-Hewitt broth medium (Oxoid, United Kingdom) with 0.5% yeast extract (Oxoid, United Kingdom) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 statically. Escherichia coli BW25113 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 were grown in Luria-Bertani broth medium (formulation per liter: 10 g tryptone [Oxoid, United Kingdom], 5 g yeast extract [Oxoid, United Kingdom], 10 g sodium chloride [Guangzhou chemicalreagent, China]) at 37\u00b0C at 200\u2009rpm. All bacterial strains were stored as a 15% glycerol stock at \u221280\u00b0C until used.\n\n## Screening of an FDA-approved small-molecule library and determination of the MIC.\nTo obtain novel antibacterial agents, a drug library of 288 FDA-approved medications was tested for antibacterial activity. S. aureus Newman was examined with the 288 compounds individually at an identical concentration of 30\u2009\u03bcM for 12 h in a 48-well microplate (1\u2009mL per well), and the inhibitory effects of small molecules on cells were evaluated by an OD600 of <0.1.\nTo confirm the antibacterial activity of crizotinib, overnight cultures of all tested bacteria were diluted 1:100 and allowed to grow to the exponential growth phase, and then 3.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU of bacteria were incubated with a series of concentration gradients of crizotinib in a 48-well microplate (1\u2009mL per well) at 37\u00b0C for 12 h at 200\u2009rpm or as a stationary culture in a 5% CO2 incubator (MCO-170AICUVHL-PC; Panasonic, Japan). The MIC was defined as the minimal concentration of crizotinib that results in no visible bacterial growth (optical density at 600\u2009nm [OD600] of <0.1). In order to investigate the effect of triphosphate disodium salt on bacterial growth, we assessed the growth states of S. aureus treated with 0.5\u00d7 the MIC (5\u2009\u03bcg/mL) of crizotinib with 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2\u2009mM cytidine-5\u2032-triphosphate disodium salt via microdilution in a 48-well plate, and then the OD600 of S. aureus was determined after 12 h. All experiments were performed in three biological replicates.\nThe assay of resistance development was performed as in previous research (26). S. aureus Newman was cultured in TSB with 0.5\u00d7 the MIC of crizotinib or Amp for about 12 h, and the MIC value was remeasured, which was repeated for 20 passages. Amp treatment was used as positive control. The development of drug resistance was assessed by calculating the ratio of MICn to MIC0. All experiments were performed in three biological replicates.\n\n## Scanning electron microscopy analysis.\nThe bacterial morphology was observed via a scanning electron microscope (Philips XL-30ESEM; Philips Netherlands). S. aureus was allowed to grow to the exponential growth phase and then diluted 1:100 with TSB without or with crizotinib at final concentrations of 1\u00d7 the MIC and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After 4\u2009h of culture, bacteria were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS three times, then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 4 h and dehydrated with ascending concentrations of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%) for 10\u2009min, and finally freeze-dried and coated with gold. The ultrastructure was observed by SEM.\n\n## Determination of the synergistic effect of crizotinib with known antibiotics.\nTo achieve better antibacterial effects of crizotinib, the antibiotics commonly used in clinical treatment, such as gentamicin (Gent), erythromycin (Erm), clindamycin (Cli), and ampicillin (Amp), were combined with crizotinib to treat bacteria. The MICs of antibiotics against S. aureus Newman were tested the same way as for crizotinib. A checkerboard assay was performed in 48-well microplates by a method previously described (27). S. aureus Newman at the exponential growth phase was diluted 1:100 with TSB containing crizotinib (0.0625\u00d7 the MIC, 0.125\u00d7 the MIC, 0.25\u00d7 the MIC, and 0.5\u00d7 the MIC) combined with Gent, Erm, Cli, and Amp (0.0625\u00d7 the MIC, 0.125\u00d7 the MIC, 0.25\u00d7 the MIC, and 0.5 \u00d7 the MIC) and further cultured for 12 h at 37\u00b0C. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC) was calculated by the formula: FIC = [MICA (combination)/MICA (alone)] + [MICB (combination)/MICB (alone)] and interpreted as follows: synergistic is an FIC of \u22640.5, additive is an FIC of >0.5 and \u22641.0, indifferent is an FIC of >1.0 and <2.0, and antagonistic is an FIC of >2.0 (28). All experiments were performed in three biological replicates.\n\n## Mouse infection model for investigation of drug efficiency.\nBALB/c female mice (6 to 8 weeks old) were purchased from the Department of Experimental Animal (Beijing HFK Bioscience) and cared for under standard conditions according to institutional guidelines. All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of Jinan University.\nThe mouse pneumonia model infected with the clinically isolated strain MRSA-166138 was created as reported previously (29). In brief, mice were anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and 2-methyl-2-butanol and then inoculated intranasally with 50\u2009\u03bcL bacterial suspension and kept upright for 60 s to allow the bacteria to be inhaled into the lungs. The PBS was used as a negative control. The mice were treated with 15\u2009mg/kg crizotinib or vehicle by gavage twice a day after MRSA-166138 infection for 12 h.\nFor the detection of surv",
