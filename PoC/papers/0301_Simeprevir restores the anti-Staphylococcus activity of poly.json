  "full_text": "## Introduction\nStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the main pathogens of hospital and community acquired infection (Diekema et al. 2019), which caused a variety of infectious diseases (including skin and soft tissue infection, endocarditis, severe sepsis and septicemia) (Lakhundi and Zhang 2018; Lowy 1998) with gradually increasing incidence from 1990 to 2019 (V\u00e1zquez-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022). Since the 1960s, abuse of antibiotics and poor control measures of bacterial infection have led to the worldwide spread of MRSA which accounts for at least 25\u201350% among S. aureus (Lee et al. 2018; V\u00e1zquez-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2022). In most cases, MRSA resisted to most antibiotics (including tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, \u00df-lactams, etc.), of which the infection types range from asymptomatic nasal colonization to mild skin and soft tissue infection, further to fulminant invasive disease with high mortality, thus making clinical treatment difficult (David and Daum 2017; Lee et al. 2018). Moreover, the formation of biofilm enhances resistance to antimicrobial agents and immune defenses, playing an important role in persistent chronic infection(Schilcher and Horswill 2020). Persister cells, randomly formed during biofilm growth, have reduced metabolic activity and exhibited high resistant to all available antibiotics, making the infection difficult to be eradicated and prone to recurrent infection (Fisher et al. 2017; Rowe et al. 2021). Therefore, there is an urgent need for new antimicrobial agents to combat MRSA and its biofilm and persister cells-related infection. However, new drugs discovery consumes a lot of labor and time. Drug repurposing or combinational therapy is a more feasible strategy than the traditional drug development.\nPolymyxins, of which polymyxin B (PB) and polymyxin E (PE) are commonly used in clinical settings (Dai et al. 2020), are currently the last line of drugs in the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infection (Bian et al. 2022), but their high nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity remain concerns (Nang et al. 2021). The bactericidal activities of polymyxins against Gram-negative bacteria are mainly dependent on the electrostatic interactions between positively charged polymyxins and negatively charged lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Li and Velkov 2019; Moffatt et al. 2019). So, structural changes in LPS are currently common causes of resistance to polymyxins in Gram-negative bacteria (Carretero-Ledesma et al. 2018; Moffatt et al. 2019). However, it is difficult to treat MRSA with polymyxins alone due to the lack of LPS in Gram-positive bacteria (Yin et al. 2020).\nThe small macrocyclic drug simeprevir (SIM) was first approved in 2013. SIM is recommended for the treatment of genotype 1 and 4 chronic hepatitis C in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin, which was reported with low incidence of clinical adverse events (including rash and anemia) (Vaidya and Perry 2013; You and Pockros 2013). SIM acts by inhibiting the viral NS3/4A serine protease and blocking replication of hepatitis C virus in host cells (Vaidya and Perry 2013). In 2022, SIM was selected from a library of 1573 drugs approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration to explore its antibacterial activity against S. aureus through high-throughput screening assays (Li et al. 2022). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report about the combinational antimicrobial effect between SIM and polymyxins against S. aureus.\nIn our study, we firstly found the synergistic antibacterial effect of SIM combined with polymyxins (especially PE) against MRSA in vitro and in vivo. Then, the anti-biofilm and anti-persister cells activities of the combination were further explored. The mechanisms of SIM restored the anti-S. aureus effects of polymyxins mainly involved in cell membrane disruption. In addition, SIM combined with polymyxins showed extremely low toxicity in vitro and in vivo. The combination of antibiotics with antibiotic adjuvants is an effective treatment option for the hard-treated infection and toxicity reducing (Douafer et al. 2019; Tyers and Wright 2019).\n\n## Reagents, strains and culture conditions\nType strains used in this study were shown in Table\u00a01. Clinical strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus faecium were isolated from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, and identified by VITEK 2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) as well as Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (BD, Germany). S. aureus and S. epidermidis were grown in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Simeprevir (SIM), polymyxin B sulfate [PB(S)], colistin (polymyxin E, PE), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and other antimicrobials were purchased from the MedChem Express (New Jersey, USA) and dissolved in deionized water or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nTable 1Bacterial strains used in this studyBacterial speciesStrainsSource\nS. aureus\nATCC 25,923Juncai LuoaATCC 29,213Juncai LuoaATCC 43,300Min LibUSA300Min LibMW2Min Lib\nEnterococcus faecalis\nATCC 29,212Juncai Luoa\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nPAO1Qiao Minqiangca.

Briefly, overnight cultured bacterial suspension was diluted to 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL. The bacterial suspension was mixed with the serially diluted antimicrobials in equal volume into a 96-well plate, further incubated at 37\u2103 for 16\u2009~\u200918\u00a0h, and the concentration at which no visible bacterial growth was defined as MIC. After the bacterial suspension cultured on 5% sheep blood agar plate (Autobio, Zhengzhou, China) for 24\u00a0h, the concentration that kills 99.9% of the colonies was defined as the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC).\n\n## Checkerboard assay\nCheckerboard assay was used to assess the antimicrobial synergies between two drugs. Briefly, equal volumes of 2-fold diluted SIM and polymyxins by Mueller\u2013Hinton (MH) II broth (Solarbio, Shanghai, China) were added to a 96-well plate in vertical and horizontal order, respectively, in the presence of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL S. aureus. After incubation at 37\u2103 for 16\u201318\u00a0h, the optical density at 630\u00a0nm (OD630) was measured, and the antibacterial interaction between the drugs was calculated by fractional inhibition concentration index (FICI) as follows: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\rm{FICI}}\\,{\\rm{ = }}\\,\\frac{{{\\rm{MIC}}A\\,{\\rm{combination}}}}{{{\\rm{MIC}}A\\,{\\rm{alone}}}}\\,{\\rm{ + }}\\,\\frac{{{\\rm{MIC}}B\\,{\\rm{combination}}}}{{{\\rm{MIC}}B\\,{\\rm{alone}}}}{\\rm{.}}$$\\end{document} FICI\u2009\u2264\u20090.5 indicates synergy, 0.5\u2009<\u2009FICI\u2009\u2264\u20094 indicates no interaction, and FICI\u2009>\u20094 indicates antagonism (She et al. 2022).\n\n## Kirby-Bauer test\nThe single colony of S. aureus was adjusted to a McFarland (McF) turbidity of 0.5 with sterile saline and spread on MH agar plate. Then the sterile discs containing the indicated concentrations of antimicrobials were placed on the MH agar plate. The diameters of the inhibition zones were measured after incubation at 37\u2103 for 18\u00a0h (Ul Haq et al. 2022).\n\n## Time-growth inhibition assay\nA single colony of S. aureus was inoculated into an appropriate amount of TSB broth to log phase. The bacterial solution was adjusted to 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL. SIM and polymyxins alone or in combination was added to the corresponding bacterial suspension to the indicated concentration. DMSO was used as a control group. Then, the bacterial suspension was incubated at 37 \u00b0C 180\u00a0rpm, an aliquot of the bacterial suspension in each group was removed into a 96-well plate for the detection of OD630 at the time point of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12\u00a0h, respectively (She et al. 2021).\n\n## Dead/live bacterial cells quantification by SYTO9/PI staining\nLog-phase-grown ATCC 43,300 was diluted with TSB to 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL. SIM (1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) alone or in combination with PB(S) (16\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) or PE (4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) was added to the bacterial suspension, respectively. After incubated at 37 \u00b0C 180\u00a0rpm for 4\u00a0h, the bacterial suspension was added with 10 \u00b5M of SYTO9 and PI mixed solution. After stained for 10\u00a0min in dark, the bacterial precipitation was collected by centrifugation and re-suspended in sterile saline and further observed by a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Vert A1). The excitation and emission wavelength of SYTO9 was 488\u00a0nm and 550\u00a0nm, respectively, and those of PI was 540 nm and 620\u00a0nm, respectively (She et al. 2022).\n\n## Resistance inducing assay\nThe MICs of polymyxins alone or in combination with SIM against S. aureus ATCC 43,300 and USA300 were determined by the antimicrobial susceptibility test as described above. Then, the bacterial suspension at 1/2\u00d7MIC was 1:1000 diluted with MH broth and further used to perform the antimicrobial susceptibility test for the next day. The assay was consecutively performed for 7 days, and the MIC value was recorded daily (She et al. 2021).\n\n## Persister cells killing assay\nMRSA were induced to the stationary-phased persister cells after cultured at 37 \u00b0C and 200\u00a0rpm for 24\u00a0h, and adjusted to a 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009108 CFU/mL(Li et al. 2022). Then indicated concentrations of SIM and polymyxins alone or in combination were added into the bacterial suspension. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C, 200\u00a0rpm for 4\u00a0h, the live persister cells were calculated by serial dilution and CFU counting.\n\n## Human RBC hemolysis\nHuman RBC was purchased from the Hemo Pharmaceutical and Biological Co (Shanghai, China). After centrifugation at 1000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min, the RBC pellets were resuspended in 5% (vol/vol) sterile saline with equal volumes of indicated concentrations of polymyxins in combination with 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of SIM and further incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1\u00a0h. After centrifugation at 1000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min, the supernatants were transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance at 570\u00a0nm (A570) was measured. 0.12% DMSO and 1% TritonX-100 were used as negative and positive control, respectively (Tan et al. 2020). The hemolysis rate was calculated as follows: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\rm{Hemolysis}}\\,{\\rm{(\\% )}}\\,{\\rm{ = }}\\,{\\rm{(}}\\frac{{A{\\rm{sample - ADMSO}}}}{{A{\\rm{TritonX - 100 - ADMSO}}}}{\\rm{)}}\\,{\\rm{ \\times }}\\,{\\rm{100\\% }}$$\\end{document}.\n\n## Cytotoxicity detection by CCK-8 kit\nThe cytotoxicity of SIM combined with polymyxins against 293T (Human renal epithelial cell line), HSF (Human skin fibroblast cell line) and HaCaT cell line (human immortalize epidermal cell line) was detected by CCK-8 assay. For example, 293T cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Kaiji Biotechnology Development Co, Nanjing, China) (containing 10% FBS\u2009+\u20091% double antibody) at 37\u2103, 5% CO2 in a saturated humidity incubator. 293T cells in logarithmic growth phase were seeded into a 96-well plate with about 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells per well, and treated with indicated concentrations of antimicrobial-containing medium for 24\u00a0h. Fresh medium containing CCK-8 solution (including 90 \u00b5L complete medium and 10 \u00b5L CCK-8 solution) was added to each well. After incubation for 1.5\u00a0h at 37\u2103, the absorbance at 450\u00a0nm was measured by microplate reader (Luo et al. 2021).\n\n## Scratch assay\nWe performed scratch assay as previously described (Lin et al. 2018; Luo et al. 2021). We plated HaCaT cells in 12-well plates, allowed them to adhere and grow to 90% confluence. Then, cells were scratched using a 200-\u00b5l pipette tip to create a scratch wound area and washed gently with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) twice to remove detached cells. And culture medium in the presence of SIM and polymyxins alone or in combination were applied for 0, 12, and 24\u00a0h, respectively, and observed by an inverted microscope (Zeiss Vert A1). Cell migration ability was evaluated by the percentage of migration rate (distance migrated/original wound distance \u00d7100%).\n\n## Apoptosis detection by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining\nThe 293T cells were cultured as described above. After 4\u00a0h of cell attachment, the cells were incubated with drug-containing complete medium at 37\u2103 5% CO2 for 24\u00a0h. Next, each well was washed 1\u20132 times with PBS and added with 500 \u00b5L of EDTA free trypsin for digestion. The cells were gently pipetted to single cell suspension, and the supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 1000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min. The cells were resuspended with 195 \u00b5L binding buffer, 5 \u00b5L Annexin V-FITC, and 10 \u00b5L PI and incubated for 10\u201320\u00a0min at room temperature in the dark. The controls were set as unstained group, PI staining group and Annexin V-FITC staining group, respectively. The fluorescence intensity was detected by flow cytometry with excitation/emission wavelengths of 488\u00a0nm/525 nm and 535\u00a0nm/615 nm for FITC and PI, respectively(BD, USA) (Liu et al. 2018).\n\n## Calcein-AM/PI staining\nThe 293T cells were cultured and treated as described above. Each well was added with 500 \u00b5L of complete medium containing Calcein AM/PI (2/10 \u00b5M) solution. After incubation at 37\u2103 5% CO2 for 30\u00a0min in the dark, the medium was replaced with fresh 37\u00baC preheated medium, and further incubated in the dark to ensure that the cell lactonase fully hydrolyzed Calcein AM to generate Calcein with green fluorescence. After washed twice with PBS, the cells were observed by the fluorescence microscope (Spark 10\u00a0M) with the maximum excitation wavelength of 494\u00a0nm/535 nm for Calcein/PI (Liu et al. 2018).\n\n## Neutrophils intracellular killing\nNeutrophils intracellular killing assay was used to determine the intracellular killing effect of SIM combined with polymyxins against S. aureus. Heparin-anticoagulated blood of healthy volunteers was mixed with an equal volume of Gibico 1640 medium, and pure neutrophils were separated from the blood by lymphocyte separation solution and erythrocyte lysis solution. The precipitation was resuspended with Gibico 1640 medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and prepared to 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/mL. The stationary-phase USA300 bacterial suspension was adjusted to a McF of 0.5. The neutrophil suspension and bacteria solution of equal volume were added into each well of 96-well plate, and cultured in a saturated humidity incubator at 37\u2103 with 5% CO2 for 30\u00a0min. Gentamicin (final concentration: 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) was added to each well for 1\u00a0h incubation to remove the extracellular bacteria. The precipitation was resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of the corresponding drug-containing medium for each group. 0.1% TritonX-100 at 37\u2103 for 10\u00a0min was used to lysis the cells. Finally, the suspensions of different groups were diluted in gradient, and counted on 5% sheep blood agar plates (Fan et al. 2021; Kang et al. 2019).\n\n## Biofilm inhibition assay\nSimilar as the above described checkerboard assay, equal volumes of 2-fold diluted SIM and polymyxins were added to a 96-well plate in vertical and horizontal order, respectively, in the presence of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CFU/mL S. aureus. After 24\u00a0h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the unattached cells were removed by PBS washing and further stained with 2% (wt/vol) crystal violet solution for 5\u00a0min. The unattached dye was removed and washed twice with PBS, and the A570 was measured and the plate was photographed(Zhang et al. 2021).\n\n## Cell membrane disruption detection by SYTOX Green/DiSC3(5) staining\nLog-phase-grown of S. aureus ATCC 43,300 was adjusted to an OD630 of 0.05 by 5 mM HEPES. For SYTOX Green staining, 2 \u00b5M of SYTOX Green was added to the bacterial suspension. Then indicated concentrations of SIM and polymyxins alone or in combination were added into the bacterial suspension. The fluorescence intensity was detected every 2\u00a0min for a total of 20\u00a0min at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 485\u00a0nm and 525\u00a0nm, respectively. For DiSC3(5) staining, the bacterial suspension with OD630 of 0.05 was mixed with 2 \u00b5M KCl, 5 mM glucose and 2 \u00b5M DiSC3(5). After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 1\u00a0h, different concentrations of polymyxins and SIM alone or in combination were applied in the bacterial suspension. The fluorescence intensity was detected every 30\u00a0s for 5\u00a0min at the excitation/emission wavelength of 622\u00a0nm/670 nm, respectively (Liu et al. 2021).\n\n## Intracellular ROS quantification by 2\u2032,7\u2032-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA)\nOvernight cultured S. aureus was centrifuged to remove the supernatant, and the cell precipitation was resuspended in 1\u00d7PBS to an OD630 of 0.5. The bacterial suspension was incubated with DCFH-DA at a final concentration of 10 \u00b5mol/L for 30\u00a0min, and then washed twice with PBS. The probe-labeled bacterial suspension and different groups of drugs in equal volume were added to 96-well plate and incubated for 30\u00a0min. The fluorescence intensity was measured at the excitation/emission wavelengths of 488\u00a0nm/525 nm, respectively (Liu et al. 2021).\n\n## In vivo\nAll animals were purchased from Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. (Changsha, China). Six-week-old female ICR mice weighing approximately 25\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0g were used in this study. The murine subcutaneous abscess model was established as previously reported by Pletzer et al. (Pletzer et al. 2018) with minor modifications. Briefly, the hair on the back was shaved using an animal electric razor. Log-phase-grown MRSA strain ATCC 43,300 was washed twice with saline and adjusted to 0.5 McF. One hundred microliter of the bacterial suspension was injected subcutaneously on the back. After 30\u00a0min of inoculation, a single dose of PB(S)/PE (30\u00a0mg/kg) and SIM (20\u00a0mg/kg) were subcutaneously injected alone or in combination. The mice injected with 1% DMSO were used as the vehicle group. Twenty-four hours post-infection, the abscess was excised and homogenized with sterile saline. The viable bacterial cells were counted by fold dilution as described above. Meanwhile, the skin specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) and then subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. To assess the in vivo toxicity of the SIM and polymyxins in combination, the blood samples were collected from the orbital vein, and the level of organic function biomarkers [including creatine kinase (CK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (CREA)] were determined by Hitachi 7600 series automated biochemistry analyzer. Meanwhile, the heart, liver, lung, kidney and spleen were taken for H&E staining on the second day after infection.\n\n## Statistical analysis\nAll experiments were performed independently in triplicate. All data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 8.0 software and expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD). Significant differences between two groups of data were compared using Student\u2019s t-test, while data comparisons of more than two groups were performed using one-way ANOVA and Dunn\u2019s multiple comparison test. P-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Synergistic antimicrobial activity between SIM and PB(S)/PE against \nWe assessed the combinational antimicrobial effects between SIM and polymyxins or their derivatives [including PE, polymyxin B(PB), PB(S), PMBN, SPR741 and SPR206] against MRSA by checkerboard assay. The results showed that SIM could be synergistic with PB, PB(S) and PE against MRSA with FICI\u2009\u2264\u20090.5, although S. aureus exhibited intrinsic resistance to polymyxins with MIC\u2009\u2265\u200916\u00a0\u00b5g/mL due to its obstruction by outer membrane (Yin et al. 2020) (Table\u00a02; Fig.\u00a01A). However, other polymyxin derivatives, such as PMBN, SPR741 and SPR206, showed no interaction against MRSA when combined with SIM (Figure S1). The combinational antimicrobial activity was not observed in Gram-negative strains including A. baumannii, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, or P. aeruginosa (Figure S2). Further, K-B test was used to confirm the synergy between SIM and polymyxins. As shown in Fig.\u00a01B and C, SIM in combination with PB(S) or PE formed a more significant growth inhibition zone against S. aureus than used alone. In addition, we found that the synergistic antimicrobial effects between SIM and PB(S)/PE against Staphylococcus type strains or clinical isolates (including MRSA, MSSA, and S. epidermidis) were strain independent with FICI\u2009\u2264\u20090.5 (Fig.\u00a02H; Figure S3).\nTable 2SIM combined with polymyxins against MRSAStrainsAntimicrobialsMIC Alone(\u00b5g/mL)MIC In combination(\u00b5g/mL)FICIOutcomeATCC 43,300PB(S)6480.375SynergySIM41PB64160.5SynergySIM41PE1640.5SynergySIM41USA300PB(S)3280.5SynergySIM41PB1640.5SynergySIM41PE6480.375SynergySIM41PB(S): polymyxin B sulfate; SIM: simeprevir; PB: polymyxin B; PE: polymyxin E\nFig. 1Antimicrobial synergy between SIM and polymyxins against S. aureus.

According to the results of time-growth curve, sub-MICs of SIM (1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL), PB(S) (8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) or PE (8\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) alone did not inhibit the growth of MRSA USA300 within 12\u00a0h, while synergistical inhibition effects were observed by SIM in combination with PB(S)/PE (Fig.\u00a02A). Similarly, the synergistic bacterial growth inhibition effect was also found in S. aureus ATCC 43,300 (Fig.\u00a02B). The representative images of viable CFU counts on sheep blood agar plates indicated the combination groups of PB(S)/PE with SIM had synergistic bactericidal activities against S. aureus (Fig.\u00a02C and D). Further, the SYTO9/PI staining images showed that as compared to the control or monotherapy groups, the viable bacteria in the combined groups were markedly decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). After quantification, the percentage of dead cells in the combination group was more than 60%, which was at least 5 times higher than that in the control group (accounting for ~\u200910%) (P\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\u00a02F). Next, we studied the bacterial resistance induced by PB(S)/PE could be reduced in the presence of sub-MIC of SIM by calculating the fold change of MIC in a 7-day consecutive resistance induce. As shown in Fig.\u00a02G, PE alone had at least a 32-fold increase in the values of MIC, whereas the MIC of PE only had an 8-fold increase in the presence of sub-MIC (0.5\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) of SIM against to S. aureus USA300. Similarly, the MIC of PB(S) exhibited 4-fold more decrease in the presence of SIM than PB(S) alone.\n\n## Acceptable cytotoxicity of SIM combined with polymyxins\nIn order to investigate the in vitro toxicity of the combination therapy between SIM and polymyxins, we firstly evaluated the human RBC hemolysis effects by PB(S)/PE in the presence of SIM. The results showed that both PB(S) and PE did not cause any hemolysis in human RBC in the presence of 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL SIM even at the concentration up to 128\u00a0\u00b5g/mL (Fig.\u00a03A and B). By CCK-8 assay, the viability of 293T cells treated with 4\u00a0\u00b5g/mL SIM combined with 32\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of PB(S)/PE also exhibited no significant difference compared with the untreated group (Fig.\u00a03C). Similarly, SIM and polymyxins combination also exhibited extremely slight toxic to HSF and HaCaT cell lines (Figure S4A). The cell apoptosis induced by SIM combined with PB(S)/PE was detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, as shown in Fig.\u00a03D. As we expected, there was no obvious difference observed between the control and monotherapy groups about the cell counts of Q2 (Fig.\u00a03E), nor in the total number of Q4\u2009+\u2009Q2 (Fig.\u00a03F). Further, we visualized the live/dead cells of 293T cells after the treatment by Calcein-AM/PI staining. As shown in Fig.\u00a03G, the viable cells of 293T cells treated with PB(S)/PE and SIM alone or in combination exhibited no obvious change compared with the untreated group. In addition, skin and soft tissue infection (including wound infection and purulent cellulitis, etc.) is one of the most common clinical manifestations of MRSA infection(Hatlen and Miller 2021). Therefore, the toxicity of SIM combined with polymyxins on the effect of skin healing should be assessed by scratch assay. In our study, we found that the migration ability of HaCaT cells in the combination group was not impaired compared with the control or monotherapy groups (Figure S4B; Figure S4C). Collectively, the combination of PB(S)/PE with SIM showed extremely low cytotoxicity to human cell lines.\nFig. 3In vitro toxicity assessments of SIM combined with PB(S) or PE.

In our study, we detected the human neutrophils intracellular killing activity of SIM in combination with polymyxins against MRSA. The representative images of intracellular S. aureus by Gram staining were shown in Fig.\u00a04A. As we expected, there was a significant reduction in viable CFU counts in the combination group compared with the control or monotherapy group (Fig.\u00a04B). Although, the stationary-phased persister cells showed high resistance to the monotherapy by SIM, PB(S) or PE, 1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of SIM significantly enhanced the bactericidal activity of PB(S)/PE against MRSA USA300 persister cells and were decreased to log10 7.57 CFU/mL and log10 7.86 CFU/mL, respectively (Fig.\u00a04C). Similarly, the persister cells counts of ATCC 43,300 between SIM and PB(S) combination was reduced by log10 2.28 CFU/mL compared with the monotherapy group of PB(S). However, no antimicrobial effect was observed against ATCC 43,300 when SIM combined with PE, probably due to the different resistant pattern or bacterial cell components. Further, the crystal violet staining showed that PB(S) alone only showed moderate biofilm inhibition activity against MRSA (ATCC 43,300 and USA300) (Fig.\u00a04D). However, the biofilm inhibition activity of PB(S) was significantly enhanced in the presence of 2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL SIM. Especially, just 2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL PB(S) combined with 1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL SIM achieved significant synergistic inhibition of USA300 biofilm formation (Fig.\u00a04E). As we expected, the thickness and the number of viable bacterial cells in the combinational groups were more obviously reduced than the untreated or monotherapy group by SYTO9/PI staining (Fig.\u00a04F).\nFig. 4SIM combined with PB(S)/PE against S. aureus high resistant phenotypes.
