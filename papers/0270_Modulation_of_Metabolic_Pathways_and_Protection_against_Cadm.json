  "abstract": "Cadmium, a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, has been\nimplicated\nin the disruption of various metabolic pathways, contributing to the\ndevelopment of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and associated\nmetabolic disorders. This study aimed to investigate the cadmium chloride\n(CdCl 2 ) exposure on metabolic pathways and to assess the\npotential therapeutic efficacy of the taxifolin-enriched extract in\nmitigating these disruptions by modulating biochemical pathways. Taxifolin-enriched\nextract (TEE) was prepared from  Pinus roxburghii  bark using a green extraction method. About 60 Wistar albino rats\nwere divided into six groups: the control group ( n  = 10), the CdCl 2  group (30 mg/kg) ( n  = 10), and four groups (each comprises  n  = 10)\ntreated with 30 mg/kg CdCl 2  in combination with metformin\n(100 mg/kg), ascorbic acid, taxifolin (30 mg/kg), and TEE (30 mg/kg),\nrespectively. After the treatment period of 1 month, a comprehensive\nassessment of metabolic biomarkers and gene expressions that regulate\nthe metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids was conducted to evaluate\nthe impact of CdCl 2  exposure and the potential protective\neffects of TEE. The results revealed that CdCl 2  exposure\nsignificantly increased ( P  < 0.001) serum levels\nof α-glucosidase, α-amylase, insulin, G6PC, hexokinases,\nTGs, LDL, HMG-CoA reductase, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as\nIL-6 and TNF-α. Conversely, CdCl 2  exposure led to\na reduction in HDL, antioxidant enzyme levels, phosphofructokinases,\nand glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase. However, the administration\nof TEE alongside CdCl 2  substantially mitigated ( P  < 0.001) these fluctuations in metabolic and inflammatory\nbiomarker levels induced by CdCl 2  exposure. Both TEE and\ntaxifolin treatment effectively lowered the elevated levels of α-amylase,\nα-glucosidase, G6PC, insulin, TGs, HMG-CoA reductase, leptin,\nALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and pro-inflammatory cytokines\nwhile simultaneously enhancing levels of HDL cholesterol and antioxidant\nenzymes. Moreover, CdCl 2  exposure suppressed mRNA expression\nof critical metabolic biomarkers such as glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2),\ninsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), lactate dehydrogenase, and HMG-CoA\nlyases while upregulating the mRNA expression of angiotensin receptor\n2 and vasopressin, key metabolic biomarkers involved in glucose metabolism\nand insulin regulation. TEE demonstrated the potential to restore\nnormal metabolic functions and reduce the adverse impacts caused by\nCdCl 2  exposure by mitigating disturbances in several metabolic\npathways and restoring gene expression of critical metabolic biomarkers\nrelated to glucose metabolism and insulin regulation. Nevertheless,\nfurther investigation is warranted to comprehensively understand the\nunderlying mechanisms and optimize the appropriate dosage and duration\nof TEE treatment for achieving the most effective therapeutic outcomes.",

      "text": "The increasing concern regarding the toxicology\nof heavy metals\nhas raised significant apprehension across various ecosystems on Earth. 1  Among these heavy metals, cadmium (Cd) is particularly\nnoteworthy as a nonessential toxic element, often referred to as the\n“metal of the 20th century”. 1 , 2  Cd\nfinds extensive use in a diverse range of industrial applications,\nincluding galvanization, electroplating, battery manufacturing, electrical\nconduction, alloy formulation, pigment and plastic production, and\nphosphate fertilizer stabilization, thus making its omnipresence a\nsource of considerable environmental apprehension. Cd is released\ninto the environment as a byproduct of smelting operations, leading\nto its widespread contamination. 3  The human\npopulation primarily encounters cadmium through dietary intake, smoking,\nand to a lesser extent drinking water. Despite the absence of any\nrecognized physiological role, emerging evidence suggests that Cd\nmay function as a potent metallohormone. 4 , 5\n\nCd has\nemerged as a prominent ecological pollutant, disseminating\nin both atmospheric and aquatic systems. The 20th century witnessed\na disturbing increase in heavy metal toxicity. 6  The extensive environmental distribution of cadmium has heightened\nconcerns regarding its disproportionate toxicity and adverse ecological\nconsequences. 6 , 7  Notably, Cd accumulates significantly\nin hepatic and renal tissues, initiating severe cellular damage across\nmultiple organ systems. 8 , 9  Cd finds widespread application\nin various industrial sectors, including paint manufacturing, silver-plating,\nbattery production, and agricultural practices. 6  Cigarette smoke is a well-recognized source of Cd exposure,\nsignificantly elevating the risk of contact. 10  Consequently, public exposure to Cd released into the environment\ndue to its diverse applications poses substantial health hazards. 4  Cd’s deleterious effects extend to soft\ntissues and cellular structures, including the liver and kidneys. 11 , 12  Despite being primarily known for its nephrotoxicity, mounting evidence\nlinks cadmium exposure to the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)\nand/or prediabetes. 13  Experimental studies\ninvolving both short-term and long-term  in vivo  Cd\nexposure have indicated its potential to induce hyperglycemia and\ndisrupt glucose homeostasis. 13  Notably,\nindividuals with elevated urinary cadmium levels tend to exhibit significantly\nlower fasting serum insulin levels compared to those without occupational\nCd exposure. 14  Mechanisms through which\nCd potentially influences glucose homeostasis encompass alterations\nin glucose transporter expression in adipocytes 15  as well as increased renal and hepatic gluconeogenesis. 16  These collective findings underscore Cd’s\nmultifaceted impact across various tissues, contributing to disrupted\nglucose homeostasis. The consumption of fruits and vegetables has\nbeen linked to a plethora of health benefits, attributed to their\nrich assortment of bioactive compounds. 15  Among these compounds, flavonoids, especially taxifolin, have emerged\nas pivotal players in mitigating various human ailments, including\ncancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative\ndisorders. Flavonoids, such as taxifolin, exhibit remarkable pharmacological\nactions and possess anticancer properties, including antiangiogenic\neffects, modulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, neutralization of\nreactive oxidative species (ROS), and induction of apoptosis. 17  Pine trees, notably  Pinus roxburghii  ( P. roxburghii ), indigenous to the\nHimalayan region, hold significant ecological and pharmacological\nimportance. 18  As members of the Pinus genus\nand Pinaceae family, these evergreen conifers make substantial contributions\nto their ecosystems. 19  Taxifolin, a flavonoid\nfound in these trees, has garnered attention due to its broad pharmacological\nactions, including its potential to counteract angiogenesis, influence\ncytochrome P450 enzymes, modulate P-glycoprotein, mitigate ROS effects,\nregulate the cell cycle, and induce apoptosis. 20\n\nWe hypothesized that exposure to cadmium chloride\n(CdCl 2 ), a pervasive environmental pollutant, induces impaired\ncarbohydrate\nmetabolism, insulin resistance, and diabetes, while the taxifolin-enriched\nextract from  P. roxburghii  holds therapeutic\npotential to counteract these effects. With the alarming rise in diabetes\ncases and its associated health burdens, understanding the impact\nof environmental pollutants like cadmium on metabolic health is crucial.\nOur aim was to rigorously investigate taxifolin’s protective\nproperties against CdCl 2 -induced metabolic disturbances,\noffering insights into mechanisms related to glucose metabolism, oxidative\nstress, and inflammation. We further expanded our study objectives\nto assess the effects of CdCl 2  on metabolic parameters,\nelucidate taxifolin’s therapeutic mechanisms, evaluate tissue\nhistopathology, and examine gene expression patterns."

      "text": "CdCl 2  (purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich), Taxifolin (sourced from Macklin Biochemical Co., China),\nMetformin, ascorbic acid, and normal saline were employed as chemical\nreagents in this study. Additionally, a Cybergreen master mix (WizPure,\nobtained from Wizbiosolutions, Korea), a cDNA kit (WizScript, also\nprovided by Wizbiosolutions, Korea), primers (supplied by Thermo Fisher\nScientific), and ELISA kits for the measurement of antioxidant enzymes\n(acquired from Elabscience ELISA kit) were utilized. Analytical-grade\nchemicals were employed exclusively throughout all of the experimental\nprocedures.\n\nA taxifolin-enriched\nextract (TEE) was meticulously prepared following a previously established\nmethodology. 21  In a concise overview, the\ninitial step involved the extraction of a crude sample using an environmentally\nfriendly green extraction method, which involved soaking the source\nmaterial in ethyl acetate. Subsequently, silica gel column chromatography\nwas employed to facilitate fractionation of the obtained extract.\nThe fractions thus obtained were subjected to further purification\nthrough a combination of column chromatography and preparative thin-layer\nchromatography (prep-TLC) techniques. This multistep procedure ensured\nthe isolation and enrichment of taxifolin from the original source\nmaterial with a high degree of precision and purity.\n\nThe taxifolin-enriched\nextract was analyzed by using HPLC with a binary gradient solvent\nsystem. The liquid chromatography setup included a C18 column (250\n× 4.6 mm 2  internal diameter) with a 5 μm film\nthickness and an oven set at 30 °C. A Chromera HPLC system from\nPerkinElmer, equipped with a Flexar Binary LC pump and a UV/vis LC\nDetector (Shelton, CT), controlled by software version 4.2.6410, was\nemployed for data analysis. The mobile phase consisted of solvent\nA (acetonitrile/methanol, 70:30) and solvent B (double-distilled water\nwith 0.5% glacial acetic acid). UV spectra were recorded at 275 nm.\nAnalyte identification was achieved by matching retention times and\nspiking samples with standards, and quantification was performed using\nthe external standard method as described previously. 22\n\nThe experiments involving\nlaboratory animals were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines\nand approval of the Ethical Review Committee of Government College\nUniversity, Faisalabad, Pakistan (GCUF/ERC/35). A total of 60 albino\nrats, comprising both male and female individuals with an average\nbody weight ranging from 150 to 200 g, were utilized in the study.\nThese rats were housed in dedicated cages within the animal facility\nlocated in the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Government College\nUniversity, Faisalabad, Pakistan. During the acclimatization phase,\nthe rats were allowed to adapt to their environment, which was maintained\nat a temperature of 25 ± 5 °C, with humidity levels ranging\nfrom 45% to 70%. The photoperiod followed a standard 12 h light and\n12 h dark cycle. The rats were provided with a standard rodent diet\nduring this period. The experimental groups were defined as follows:\n\nGroup 1: Named CON, they received oral administration of normal\nsaline.\n\nGroup 2: Named as CdCl 2 , it was treated with\nCdCl 2  at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight to induce metabolic\nimpairment.\n\nGroup 3: Named as MTF, treated with metformin at\na dose of 100\nmg/kg of body weight 1 h before the administration of CdCl 2  (30 mg/kg).\n\nGroup 4: Named as AA, treated with ascorbic acid\n(AA) at a dose\nof 100 mg/kg 1 h before the administration of CdCl 2  (30\nmg/kg).\n\nGroup 5: Named as TFN, treated with taxifolin (TFN)\nat a dose of\n30 mg/kg, also 1 h before the administration of CdCl 2  (30\nmg/kg).\n\nGroup 6: Named as TEE, treated with taxifolin-enriched\nextract\nat a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight 1 h before the administration\nof CdCl 2  (30 mg/kg).\n\nThe collected blood samples\nwere left undisturbed to undergo coagulation at room temperature for\na duration of 20 min. Subsequently, the blood specimens were subjected\nto centrifugation at 3000 g  for 15 min. The resulting\nserum obtained post centrifugation was carefully preserved and stored\nat a temperature of −20 °C until it was ready for subsequent\nanalytical procedures.\n\nHyperglycemia is a\nphysiological state characterized by an elevated concentration of\nglucose in the circulatory system. It serves as a pivotal indicator\nof the presence of DM. To monitor the blood glucose levels in all\nexperimental animal groups, a glucometer (specifically, the Accu-Chek\nPerforma model) was employed to measure the glucose concentration\ntwice a week.\n\nA subgroup of 3–4\nanimals was systematically selected from each experimental group and\nhoused individually in cages, with the intention of conducting an\noral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The OGTT was carried out 2 days\nprior to the conclusion of the cadmium exposure period. The chosen\nanimals were subjected to a fasting period, refraining from both food\nand water consumption for a period spanning 4–6 h. Following\nthis fasting interval, a baseline blood sample was obtained from each\nanimal (0 min). Subsequently, an oral glucose challenge was administered\nvia gavage, wherein an anhydrous glucose solution was delivered at\na dosage of 1.75 g/kg of body weight. 23  Blood samples were collected at specific time intervals, namely,\n30, 60, 90, and 120 min postglucose administration. Each blood sample\nconsisted of 100 μL and was obtained from the tail veins of\nthe animals. These collected samples were then subjected to centrifugation\nfor a duration of 10 min at 400 g . The resultant serum\nwas carefully isolated and subsequently stored at a temperature of\n−70 °C, pending further analysis to determine the glucose\nand insulin levels.\n\nA subset of animals,\nspecifically 3–4 individuals from each experimental group,\nwere chosen to undergo an insulin tolerance test (ITT). These mice\nwere subjected to a period of fasting, abstaining from food intake\nfor a duration of 4–6 h. The subsequent ITT was conducted at\n10 am without the use of anesthesia to maintain physiological condition.\nBasal glycemia was assessed by collecting blood samples from the tail\nvein at the commencement of the experiment (0 min). Following the\nbaseline measurements, insulin was administered intraperitoneally\nat a dosage of 1 U/kg of body weight. Blood samples were subsequently\ncollected at specified time intervals, including 0, 30, 60, 90, and\n120 min postinsulin administration, with each sample being obtained\nfrom the tail vein. To evaluate insulin sensitivity, the glucose disappearance\nconstant (kITT) was determined. This constant was calculated by performing\na linear regression analysis on the Napierian logarithm of the glycemic\nvalues acquired during the 0–120 min period of the test.\n\nAn additional cohort\nof 3–4 animals was incorporated into the study and subjected\nto the Pyruvate tolerance test (PTT). In this experimental protocol,\nthe mice were subjected to a fasting period lasting 12 h and the subsequent\ntest was conducted at 8 AM. To ensure the animals’ comfort\nand compliance, anesthesia was administered using sodium pentobarbital\nat a dose of 60 mg/kg of body weight, delivered intraperitoneally.\nFollowing the induction of anesthesia, a pyruvate solution with a\nconcentration of 0.25 g/mL was administered intraperitoneally to the\nanimals at a dosage of 2 g/kg of body weight. Glycemia levels were\nmonitored by collecting blood samples from the tail vein at multiple\ntime points, including baseline (0 min) and subsequently at 30, 60,\n90, and 120 min following the pyruvate administration. To assess hepatic\nglucose production, the area under the curve of glycemia following\nthe pyruvate challenge was calculated using GraphPad Prism version\n5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). 24  This analysis provided insights into the animals’ response\nto pyruvate and their hepatic glucose production capacity.\n\nThe\nserum levels of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, specifically α-glucosidase\n(Catalog Number: E-EL-R1083, Elabscience), α-amylase (Catalog\nNumber: E-EL-R2544, Elabscience), skeletal muscle hexokinase (Catalog\nNumber: E-EL-RR0502, Elabscience), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(G6PDH) (Catalog Number: E-BC-K056-M, Elabscience), liver tissue phosphofructokinase\n(Catalog Number: E-BC-K612-M, Elabscience), and liver tissue glucose-6-phosphatase\n(G6PC) (Catalog Number: E-EL-M1362, Elabscience), were quantified\nutilizing the ELISA method. The measurements were conducted using\na Microplate ELISA reader (Bio Tek Instruments, Inc.).\n\nLiver tissues were\npromptly excised and subsequently homogenized in phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS) at a pH of 7.4. Following homogenization, centrifugation\nwas carried out and the resulting supernatant was collected for the\nassessment of various biochemical parameters. The activities of superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)\nin the tissue were determined in accordance with the manufacturer’s\ninstructions, utilizing commercially available assay kits.\n\nTo assess\nthe influence of heavy metal exposure on dyslipidemia, several key\nlipid control biomarkers, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL),\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TGs), were quantified\nfrom serum samples. The quantification of HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic\nenzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, was conducted utilizing\na microplate ELISA reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) in accordance\nwith the manufacturer’s instructions and a commercially available\nELISA kit (Catalog Number: E-EL-H2472, Elabscience).\n\nThe serum concentrations\nof inflammatory biomarkers, namely, interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Catalog\nNumber: E-EL-R0015, Elabscience) and tumor necrosis factor-α\n(TNF-α) (Catalog Number: E-EL-R0019, Elabscience), as well as\nadipokines, specifically, adiponectin (Catalog Number: E-BC-K013-S,\nElabscience) and leptin (Catalog Number: 201905, Elabscience), were\nquantified using commercially available ELISA kits. These measurements\nwere conducted with the aid of microplate ELISA.\n\nFollowing the homogenization of liver tissue,\ntotal RNA extraction was carried out employing Trizol reagent (Thermo\nFisher Scientific, MA) following the manufacturer’s guidelines.\nThe quantification of the total RNA yield was performed using a NanoDrop\n2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) at an absorbance of 260\nnm. Furthermore, the quality of RNA was assessed by visual examination\non a 1% agarose gel. Subsequently, 2 μg of total RNA was subjected\nto reverse transcription utilizing the RevertAid cDNA synthesis kit\nfrom Thermo Fisher Scientific. The amplification process was executed\nusing the Applied Biosystems Real-Time PCR System, with a final reaction\nvolume of 20 μL. The expression levels of the specified genes\n( Table  1 ) were analyzed\nduring the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For the PCR procedure,\nthe denaturation step was carried out at 95 °C for a duration\nof 15 s for all three genes. This was followed by 40 cycles consisting\nof denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s and annealing/extension at 60\n°C for 30 s.\n\nSmall segments of freshly\nexcised liver, pancreas, and kidney tissues were promptly submerged\nin a 10% formalin solution and subsequently embedded in paraffin wax\nto facilitate morphological studies. The paraffin-embedded sections\nwere subjected to staining using hematoxylin and eosin. Each prepared\nslide was thoroughly examined under a light microscope to conduct\nspecific morphological assessments."

Following a fasting period\nof 4–6 h, animals received a predetermined quantity of insulin,\nand their blood glucose levels were monitored at 0, 30, 60, 90, and\n120 min intervals. The results indicated that the CdCl 2 -treated group exhibited significantly higher blood glucose levels\n( P  < 0.001) compared to the CON group ( Figure  2 B). However, treatment\nwith TEE markedly reduced blood glucose levels ( P  < 0.001) in the TEE group when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group. Additionally, it also led to a reduction in the area\nunder the curve (AUC) ( Figure  3 B,D). To assess insulin resistance based on fasting blood\nglucose levels and serum insulin levels, the Homeostatic Model Assessment\nof Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. It was evident that\nthe CdCl 2 -treated group exhibited significantly greater\ninsulin resistance ( P  < 0.001) compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  3 C). However, treatment with TFN, TEE, and AA improved CdCl 2 -induced insulin resistance in the TFN, TEE, and AA groups, respectively,\nsimilar to that in the MTF-treated animals in the MTF group ( Figure  3 C).\n\nTo assess\nthe impact of TEE on gluconeogenesis, animals underwent a fasting\nperiod of 6–8 h to deplete hepatic glycogen reserves. Following\nthis fasting period, pyruvate was administered as a substrate to the\nanimals. Pyruvate significantly elevated blood glucose levels in the\nCdCl 2 -treated group after 30 min when compared to the CON\ngroup ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 A).

However, treatment\nwith TEE significantly reduced the levels of α-amylase and α-glucosidase\nin the TEE group more effectively when compared to the TFN treatment\nin the TFN group ( Figure  5 A,B).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on (A) α-amylase\nand (B) α-glucosidase.

In the notation\nused, “a” indicates a significant difference when compared\nto the control group, while “b” denotes a significant\ndifference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nG6P activity was significantly increased ( P  <\n0.001) in the CdCl 2 -treated group due to CdCl 2  treatment. However, treatment with TEE induced a notable decline,\nrestoring glucose-6-phosphatase levels to a normal range in the TEE\ngroup ( Figure  6 A).\nTaxifolin, ascorbic acid, and metformin also successfully reversed\nabnormally elevated levels of G6P ( Figure  6 A). CdCl 2  treatment significantly\nincreased hexokinase levels ( P  < 0.001) in the\nCdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  6 B). Nonetheless, administration of TEE, TFN, MTF, and\nAA significantly reduced the elevated hexokinase levels in the TEE,\nTFN, MTF, and AA groups ( Figure  6 B). Phosphofructokinase activity was markedly decreased\n( P  < 0.001) in the CdCl 2 -treated group\ncompared to the control group (CON) ( Figure  6 C). However, treatment TEE significantly\n( P  < 0.001) restored phosphofructokinase activity\nin the TEE group ( Figure  6 C). TFN, MTF, and AA also improved the decreased phosphofructokinase\nactivity in the TFN, MTF, and AA groups ( Figure  6 C). Similarly, TEE treatment significantly\nincreased ( P  < 0.001) the activity of G6PDH in\nthe TEE group compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  6 D). TFN, AA, and\nMTF also increased the G6PDH activity in the TFN, AA, and MTF groups,\nrespectively ( Figure  6 D).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on the serum levels of\n(A) glucose-6-phosphatase and (B) hexokinase, as well as on the activity\nof (C) phosphofructokinase and (D) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\nData is presented as mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined\nusing a one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple\ncomparisons. In the notation used, “a” indicates a significant\ndifference when compared to the control group, while “b”\ndenotes a significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nTEE exhibited significant antioxidant potential by modulating the\nactivity of the first-line antioxidant enzymes. It was observed that\nCdCl 2  treatment led to a decrease in the levels of CAT,\nSOD, and GPx in the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  7 A–C). However, treatment\nwith taxifolin-enriched extract markedly restored these antioxidant\nenzyme levels ( P  < 0.05) in the TEE group ( Figure  7 A–C). In the\nTFN group, TFN also improved the levels of antioxidant enzymes, although\nto a comparatively lesser extent when compared with the TEE in the\nTEE group ( Figure  7 A–C).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on first-line\nantioxidant\nenzymes, namely, (A) catalase, (B) superoxide dismutase, and (C) glutathione\nperoxidase. Data is presented as mean ± SD. Significance levels\nwere determined using a one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test\nfor multiple comparisons. In the notation used, “a”\nindicates a significant difference when compared to the control group,\nwhile “b” denotes a significant difference when compared\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nThe evaluation\nof lipid biomarkers, including HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and HMG-CoA\nreductase, was conducted. As a result of cadmium chloride administration,\nthe serum levels of HDL significantly decreased when compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  8 A). However, treatment with TEE, TFN, MTF, and AA notably restored\nthe abnormally decreased HDL levels in the TFN, MFT, and AA groups\nwhen compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  8 A). Conversely, the serum levels of LDL,\nTGs, and HMG-CoA reductase significantly increased ( P  < 0.05) in the CdCl 2 -treated group compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  8 B–D). Treatment with TEE, TFN, MTF, and AA effectively reversed\nthese abnormal increases in these parameters in the TFN, MFT, and\nAA groups when compared to those in the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  8 B–D).\n\nImpact of treatment\nand CdCl 2  on the serum levels of\n(A) HDL, (B) LDL, (C) TGs, and (D) HMG-CoA reductase. Data is presented\nas mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined using a one-way\nANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\nIn the\nCdCl 2 -treated group, it was observed that the administration\nof CdCl 2  significantly increased the levels of leptin and\nadiponectin, as well as inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6)\nwhen compared to the CON group ( Figure  8 A–D). However, treatment with TEE led to a significant\nreduction ( P  < 0.05) in the release of inflammatory\nmarkers IL-6 and TNF-α, thereby mitigating the inflammatory\nresponses ( Figure  9 C,D). Additionally, TEE treatment decreased the level of leptin by\nreducing the excessive release of leptin and adiponectin from adipose\ntissues, as observed in the TEE group ( Figure  9 A,B). Similarly, TFN, AA, and MTF also decreased\n( P  < 0.05) the liberation of inflammatory cytokines\nIL-6 and TNF-α in the TFF, MTF, and AA groups, although to a\nlesser extent compared to the taxifolin extract treatment in the TEE\ngroup ( Figure  9 C,D).\n\nImpact\nof treatment and CdCl 2  on serum levels of (A)\nleptin, (B) adiponectin, (C) IL-6, and (D) TNF-α. The data is\npresented as mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined using\na one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\nCdCl 2  treatment markedly increased ( P  < 0.05)\nthe levels of AST and ALT in the CdCl 2  group when compared\nto the CON group ( Figure  10 A,B). However, treatment with TEE exhibited a hepatoprotective\neffect by significantly reducing the levels of AST and ALT in the\nTEE group. In the TFN, MTF, and AA groups, the elevated levels of\nAST and ALT also improved but to a lesser extent compared to those\nin the TEE group ( Figure  10 A,B). CdCl 2  treatment significantly elevated ( P  < 0.05) the levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum\ncreatinine in the CdCl 2  group in comparison to the CON\ngroup ( Figure  10 C,D).\nNevertheless, treatment with TEE significantly ameliorated the increased\nlevels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine when compared to all\nother treatment groups ( Figure  10 C,D).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on serum levels\nof (A)\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), (B) alanine transaminase (ALT),\n(C) blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and (D) creatinine. Data is presented\nas mean ± SD. The level of significant difference was determined\nusing one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\nCdCl 2  administration\nsignificantly downregulated ( P  < 0.001) the mRNA\nexpression of IGF-1 and GLUT2 in the CdCl 2  group compared\nto the CON group ( Figure  10 A,B). However, treatment with TEE, TFN, AA, and MTF mitigated\n( P  < 0.001) the mRNA expression of these genes,\nsimilar to the CON group ( Figure  11 A,B). CdCl 2  intoxication induced downregulation\n( P  < 0.001) in mRNA expression of HMG-CoA lyase\nin the CdCl 2  group compared to the CON ( Figure  11 C). However, TEE markedly\nimproved ( P  < 0.001) the downregulated expression\nof HMG-CoA lyase compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  11 C). TFN, AA, and\nMTF also mitigated the expression, but to a lesser extent compared\nto TEE in the TEE group ( Figure  11 C). Angiotensin receptor II and lactate dehydrogenase\nexpression were significantly upregulated ( P  <\n0.001) in the CdCl 2  group compared to the control, TEE,\nTFN, AA, and MTF groups ( Figure  10 D,E). However, taxifolin-enriched extract treatment\nnotably downregulated ( P  < 0.001) the mRNA expression\nof angiotensin receptor II and lactate dehydrogenase, similar to the\ncontrol group in the TEE group ( Figure  11 D,E). Similarly, in mRNA expression of vasopressin,\ndownregulation ( P  < 0.001) was observed in the\nCdCl 2  group compared to the control ( Figure  10 F). Taxifolin-enriched extract\nmarkedly improved ( P  < 0.001) the downregulated\nexpression of vasopressin compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  11 F). However, TFN,\nAA, and MTF also lessened the expression, but to a lesser extent compared\nto TEE in the TEE group ( Figure  11 F).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on mRNA expression\nof\n(A) IGF-1, (B) GLUT2, (C) HMG-CoA lyase, (D) angiotensin II receptor,\n(E) lactate dehydrogenase, and (F) vasopressin. Data are presented\nas mean ± SD. The level of significant difference was calculated\nby one-way ANOVA using Bonferroni post-test. “a” represents\na significant difference when compared with the control group, while\n“b” represents a significant difference when compared\nwith the CdCl 2  group.\n\nHistopathological examination revealed that the CON group exhibited\na normal architecture of hepatic tissues with well-defined nuclei,\nchromatin material, intact parenchyma, and organized hepatic cords.\nIn contrast, the CdCl 2  group showed disrupted hepatic cords,\ninflammation, cytoplasmic fat droplet deposition, and infiltration\nof inflammatory mediators. However, treatment with the taxifolin-enriched\nextract and taxifolin demonstrated improvements in histopathological\nfeatures, including the restoration of normal sinusoidal spaces, prominent\nnuclei, and the absence of hepatocyte inflammation ( Figure  12 ). The CON group displayed\na normal appearance and a healthy distribution of Islets of Langerhans\nwithin the pancreas parenchyma. In the CdCl 2  group, there\nwas a significant decrease in the number of Islets of Langerhans,\nindicating necrotic changes and impaired insulin production. However,\nin the TEE group, the number of healthy Islets of Langerhans was markedly\nrestored compared to that in the TFN, MTF, and AA groups, demonstrating\nthe restorative function of the pancreas. Microscopic examination\nof the kidneys in the CdCl 2  group revealed vacuolar degenerations\nand glomerular lesions. Kidney histopathological analysis further\nindicated thickening of the basement membrane, tubular lesions, mononuclear\ncell and leukocyte infiltration, edema, and granular deposit formation\ndue to CdCl 2  administration. These pathological hallmarks\nwere mitigated and improved in the TEE and TFN groups compared to\nthose in other treatment groups and the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  12 ).\n\nImpact of treatment\nand CdCl 2  on kidney, liver, and\npancreas histopathology: kidney histopathology: tubular vacuolization\nand dilation (yellow arrow), pyknotic tubular nucleus (black arrow),\ninfiltration of leukocytes and mononuclear cells (red arrow), hemorrhage,\nand congestion (green arrow).

      "text": "Over the past 5 decades, research has established\nthe role of inorganic\nmetals in disrupting insulin and glucose homeostasis in target tissues.\nInorganic metals, such as Cd, have been shown to induce metabolic\ndisorders that impair β-cell function and contribute to the\ndevelopment of T2DM. The deleterious effects of Cd on metabolic pathways,\nparticularly carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, have garnered increasing\nattention due to their potential role in the development of metabolic\ndisorders such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Cd exposure\nhas been linked to impaired carbohydrate metabolism, which is characterized\nby insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Cd disrupts insulin\nsignaling pathways, reducing the sensitivity of target tissues to\ninsulin, and thereby impairing glucose uptake. This leads to elevated\nblood glucose levels, a hallmark of DM. Additionally, Cd interferes\nwith glucose homeostasis by modulating genes involved in glycometabolism\nsuch as GLUT2 and IGF-1. These disruptions in glucose metabolism can\nset the stage for the development of T2DM. Furthermore, Cd exerts\na detrimental effect on lipid metabolism. It disrupts the balance\nbetween HDL and LDL cholesterol, leading to dyslipidemia characterized\nby elevated LDL cholesterol and TGs, along with decreased HDL cholesterol\nlevels. Cd-induced oxidative stress and inflammation further exacerbate\nlipid dysregulation, contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis\nand cardiovascular diseases. Cd’s association with metabolic\nimpairment, particularly in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, highlights\nits potential role as a significant risk factor for metabolic disorders.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying Cd’s disruptive effects\non these metabolic pathways is crucial for developing strategies to\nmitigate its adverse health outcomes. The study’s findings\nsuggest that TEE may hold promise in counteracting Cd-induced metabolic\ndisturbances, offering hope for potential therapeutic interventions\nin individuals exposed to environmental Cd contamination.\n\nIn\nthe present study, our focus is on Cd-induced impairment of\ncarbohydrate metabolism and the development of DM. Cd was selected\nfor this study due to its high presence in soil, its uptake by plants,\nand its resulting dietary consumption, which raises serious public\nhealth concerns. Additionally, cigarette smoke is another source of\nthis toxic metal as smokers have been found to have higher serum levels\nof Cd. Recent research has indicated that Cd plays a role in metabolic\ndisruption through the modulation of gene expression, oxidative stress,\nand inflammatory cytokines. Human clinical studies and animal studies\nhave demonstrated that Cd has the ability to accumulate in the pancreas\nand induce pancreatotoxic effects. In recent decades, the role of\nCd in the development of DM and insulin resistance has been reported,\naffecting processes such as glycogenesis, glucose filtration, and\ngluconeogenesis. Therefore, in the current study, a diabetic rat model\ninduced by Cd consumption was established to investigate the effects\nof Cd on the carbohydrate metabolism and diabetes-related complications.\n\nP. roxburghii  is rich in taxifolin,\na bioactive compound known for its diverse pharmacological activities.\nIn our current study, we prepared a taxifolin-enriched extract from  P. roxburghii  and investigated its protective potential\nagainst CdCl 2 -induced metabolic impairments and DM. In\nour rat model, CdCl 2  administration led to increased body\nweight, fasting, and random blood sugar levels during the experimental\nperiod. In our current study, TEE reduced body weight, fasting, and\nrandom blood sugar levels, consistent with its reported actions. Studies\nby Gao et al., 25  Zhao et al. 26  have documented the antidiabetic effects of\nTFN through the modulation of glucose metabolism via the PI3K/AKT\nantioxidant signaling pathways. In our study, treatment with TEE reduced\nblood glucose levels in the glucose tolerance test, aligning with\nthe previously reported actions of taxifolin. 26\n\nThe ITT is considered the gold standard for investigating\nglucocorticoid\ndepletion. Following an overnight fast, insulin is administered, and\nblood samples are collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min intervals to\nassess blood glucose levels. The rate of plasma glucose disappearance,\ndenoted as kITT, is then estimated to determine insulin sensitivity.\nIn the current study, CdCl 2  administration resulted in\nan increase in serum insulin levels due to impaired glucose metabolism.\nHowever, treatment with TEE and TFN reduced serum insulin levels and\nincreased insulin sensitivity in the treatment groups. This aligns\nwith the findings of Lee et al., 27  who\nreported the therapeutic effect of TFN in mitigating insulin resistance\nand enhancing insulin tolerance in a model of insulin resistance induced\nby free fatty acids. Consistent with this work, our study demonstrated\nthat TEE treatment reduced insulin resistance and improved insulin\nsensitivity in CdCl 2 -induced metabolic impairments. The\nPTT is an indirect method for quantifying gluconeogenesis, designed\nto assess the conversion rate of pyruvate to glucose. It serves as\na gold standard assay for estimating glucose production. Animals fasted\nfor 6–8 h before receiving intraperitoneal pyruvate administration,\nand the AUC is calculated to determine glucose production from pyruvate.\nExcessive conversion of pyruvate to glucose can contribute to glucose\nintolerance. Treatment with TEE in our study exhibited antihyperglycemic\neffects by regulating blood glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity,\nconsistent with previous research. It has been reported that an extract\nenriched with taxifolin from  Hydnocarpus alpina  produced robust glycemic control and increased insulin secretion\nthrough a signaling pathway dependent on K + -ATP channels. 21\n\nCdCl 2  administration increased\nthe levels of α-amylase\nand α-glucosidase in the treatment group, resulting in elevated\npostprandial hyperglycemia. Both enzymes catalyze the digestion of\ncarbohydrates by cleaving α1-4 glyosidic linkages, leading to\nincreased levels of monosaccharides. 28  In\nthe present study, treatment with TEE and TFN decreased the levels\nof α-amylase and α-glucosidase in the serum, resulting\nin controlled postprandial sugar levels, which supports the previously\nreported antidiabetic effects of TFN. Su et al. 29  documented the inhibitory effect of TFN on these enzymes\nin both  in vitro  and  in vivo  experimental\nstudies. Similar to previous findings, TFN treatment in our study\nnormalized blood glucose levels, hexokinase activity, and insulin\nsecretion. 21  In the present study, CdCl 2  decreased the levels of phosphofructokinases. However, treatment\nwith TEE normalized the levels of phosphofructokinases, similar to\nthe findings of Pérez Gutiérrez, 30  who reported that TEE treatment increased the decreased\nlevels of phosphofructokinases in a diabetes model. Like previous\nfindings, TFN treatment mitigated the Cd-induced increase in G6P levels\nmarkedly. 21  Taxifolin’s robust antioxidant\nand anti-inflammatory potential has been established in the literature. 31 − 33  Similarly, in the current experimental design, TFN reduced oxidative\nstress induced by CdCl 2  through the modulation of first-line\nantioxidant enzymes and decreased inflammation by modulating key inflammatory\ncytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. 34 , 35  CdCl 2  is\nan obesogenic factor, as its administration led to increased levels\nof fatty acids, cholesterol, TGs, and FFAs, consistent with the literature. 36  However, treatment with TEE mitigated hyperlipidemia\nby modulating hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and other multiple lipid-lowering\npathways. 37  Cd produced hepatotoxicity\nin the current study’s treatment groups, as evidenced by elevated\nlevels of AST and ALT due to Cd 2 +  binding with\nsulfhydryl groups in mitochondria, leading to oxidative stress, mitochondrial\ndysfunction, and ischemia to hepatocytes. Cd also induced the activation\nof Kupffer cells and mediated inflammatory responses through the activation\nof inflammatory cytokines. TEE exhibited a hepatoprotective effect\nand decreased the levels of ALT and AST to within the normal physiological\nrange. Cd also induced nephrotoxicity in the treatment group, leading\nto elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, similar\nto previous studies reporting the nephrotoxic effects of this metal. 38 , 39  TEE, due to its nephron-protective effect, modulated the levels\nof blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. 40  Gene expression analysis of critical genes linked to glucose metabolism,\ninsulin tolerance, and sensitivity was also conducted. CdCl 2  administration downregulated the expression of IGF-1, a crucial\nfactor regulating insulin release. TEE treatment regulated glycometabolism,\nmitochondrial function, and IGF-1 expression, similar to previous\nreports. 41  CdCl 2  treatment downregulated\nthe expression of GLUT2 in adipocytes, impairing carbohydrate metabolism\nand glucose tolerance, consistent with previous findings. 42  However, TFN upregulated the mRNA expression\nof these key genes that regulate glucose and insulin homeostasis.\nmRNA expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was upregulated in\nthe CdCl 2  group, resulting in oxidative stress, as reported\nin recent work. 43  However, TEE treatment\nmitigated the expression of LDH. CdCl 2  treatment upregulated\nthe expression of angiotensin II receptors, leading to insulin insensitivity,\nimpaired glucose transport in skeletal muscles, and abnormal pancreatic\nblood flow, which can result in the development of diabetes. TEE treatment\nnotably decreased the expression of angiotensin II receptors, acting\nas an inhibitor and showing promise in the treatment of DM. HMG-CoA\nlyase is responsible for the breakdown of lipids and proteins to generate\nglucose monomers. CdCl 2  treatment impaired the expression\nof HMG-CoA and vasopressin, resulting in an impairment of carbohydrate\nmetabolism. However, taxifolin extract treatment remarkably recovered\nthe mRNA expression of these key glucogenic genes.\n\nThe mechanism\nof action underlying the protective effects of TEE\nagainst Cd-induced metabolic disruptions involves multifaceted interactions\nat the molecular level. TEE primarily targets the disrupted pathways\nin carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. TEE mitigates Cd-induced impairments\nby modulating key signaling pathways, including the antioxidant signaling\ncascade, thus, enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.\nFurthermore, TEE exerts regulatory effects on gene expression, notably\nupregulating critical genes involved in glycometabolism such as GLUT2\nand IGF-1, which are downregulated by Cd. The extract’s antioxidant\nand anti-inflammatory potential contributes to the restoration of\nmetabolic homeostasis by counteracting Cd-induced oxidative stress\nand inflammation. TEE’s ability to normalize enzymatic activities,\nregulate lipid profiles, and protect against Cd-induced hepatotoxicity\nand nephrotoxicity further underscores its comprehensive impact on\nmitigating the adverse effects of cadmium on metabolic pathways. A\nschematic representation of the mechanism of action of TEE against\nCd-induced metabolic impairment is depicted in  Figure  13 .\n\nSchematic representation illustrates the intricate\nmechanism of\naction through which taxifolin-enriched extract (TEE) modulates the\nbiochemical pathways affected by cadmium.\n\nWhile this study provides valuable insights into\nthe protective\neffects of TEE against Cd-induced metabolic impairment using an experimental\nanimal model, it is crucial to mention the certain limitations inherent\nin this experimental approach. First, extrapolating the findings from\nanimal models to human contexts requires caution due to potential\nspecies differences in metabolic responses. Additionally, the controlled\nenvironment of animal studies may not fully capture the complexity\nof human metabolic disorders and impairments. Moreover, the study\nfocuses on a specific bioactive compound, i.e., taxifolin, that is\nenriched in taxifolin extract rather than the broader spectrum of\npotential interactions within a natural environment. Addressing these\nlimitations through a discussion of potential implications emphasizes\nthe need for cautious interpretation and encourages future studies,\npotentially involving human clinical trials, to validate the observed\neffects in a more translational context. This discussion contributes\nto a more comprehensive evaluation of the study, providing a balanced\nunderstanding of its significance and potential applications.\n\nThe findings of this study, highlighting the protective effects\nof TEE against Cd-induced metabolic disruptions and impairments, have\nsignificant implications for human health and the broader population.\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of Cd exposure through soil, dietary intake,\nand sources such as cigarette smoke, our study underscores the potential\nrelevance of TEE as a therapeutic intervention for individuals exposed\nto Cd contamination. Considering the established links between Cd\nand metabolic disorders, the study’s outcomes suggest that\nTEE may offer a promising avenue for mitigating the adverse health\neffects associated with Cd exposure. Further studies of TEE’s\nefficacy in human clinical studies could contribute to the development\nof preventive strategies and interventions for populations at risk.\nThe study’s comprehensive insights into the molecular mechanisms\ninvolved in TEE’s protective effects also lay the groundwork\nfor future research aimed at understanding and addressing the broader\nimplications of Cd-induced metabolic impairments on public health."

This study aimed to investigate the cadmium chloride\n(CdCl 2 ) exposure on metabolic pathways and to assess the\npotential therapeutic efficacy of the taxifolin-enriched extract in\nmitigating these disruptions by modulating biochemical pathways. Taxifolin-enriched\nextract (TEE) was prepared from  Pinus roxburghii  bark using a green extraction method. About 60 Wistar albino rats\nwere divided into six groups: the control group ( n  = 10), the CdCl 2  group (30 mg/kg) ( n  = 10), and four groups (each comprises  n  = 10)\ntreated with 30 mg/kg CdCl 2  in combination with metformin\n(100 mg/kg), ascorbic acid, taxifolin (30 mg/kg), and TEE (30 mg/kg),\nrespectively. After the treatment period of 1 month, a comprehensive\nassessment of metabolic biomarkers and gene expressions that regulate\nthe metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids was conducted to evaluate\nthe impact of CdCl 2  exposure and the potential protective\neffects of TEE. The results revealed that CdCl 2  exposure\nsignificantly increased ( P  < 0.001) serum levels\nof α-glucosidase, α-amylase, insulin, G6PC, hexokinases,\nTGs, LDL, HMG-CoA reductase, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as\nIL-6 and TNF-α. Conversely, CdCl 2  exposure led to\na reduction in HDL, antioxidant enzyme levels, phosphofructokinases,\nand glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase. However, the administration\nof TEE alongside CdCl 2  substantially mitigated ( P  < 0.001) these fluctuations in metabolic and inflammatory\nbiomarker levels induced by CdCl 2  exposure. Both TEE and\ntaxifolin treatment effectively lowered the elevated levels of α-amylase,\nα-glucosidase, G6PC, insulin, TGs, HMG-CoA reductase, leptin,\nALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and pro-inflammatory cytokines\nwhile simultaneously enhancing levels of HDL cholesterol and antioxidant\nenzymes. Moreover, CdCl 2  exposure suppressed mRNA expression\nof critical metabolic biomarkers such as glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2),\ninsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), lactate dehydrogenase, and HMG-CoA\nlyases while upregulating the mRNA expression of angiotensin receptor\n2 and vasopressin, key metabolic biomarkers involved in glucose metabolism\nand insulin regulation. TEE demonstrated the potential to restore\nnormal metabolic functions and reduce the adverse impacts caused by\nCdCl 2  exposure by mitigating disturbances in several metabolic\npathways and restoring gene expression of critical metabolic biomarkers\nrelated to glucose metabolism and insulin regulation. Nevertheless,\nfurther investigation is warranted to comprehensively understand the\nunderlying mechanisms and optimize the appropriate dosage and duration\nof TEE treatment for achieving the most effective therapeutic outcomes.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe increasing concern regarding the toxicology\nof heavy metals\nhas raised significant apprehension across various ecosystems on Earth. 1  Among these heavy metals, cadmium (Cd) is particularly\nnoteworthy as a nonessential toxic element, often referred to as the\n“metal of the 20th century”. 1 , 2  Cd\nfinds extensive use in a diverse range of industrial applications,\nincluding galvanization, electroplating, battery manufacturing, electrical\nconduction, alloy formulation, pigment and plastic production, and\nphosphate fertilizer stabilization, thus making its omnipresence a\nsource of considerable environmental apprehension. Cd is released\ninto the environment as a byproduct of smelting operations, leading\nto its widespread contamination. 3  The human\npopulation primarily encounters cadmium through dietary intake, smoking,\nand to a lesser extent drinking water. Despite the absence of any\nrecognized physiological role, emerging evidence suggests that Cd\nmay function as a potent metallohormone. 4 , 5\n\nCd has\nemerged as a prominent ecological pollutant, disseminating\nin both atmospheric and aquatic systems. The 20th century witnessed\na disturbing increase in heavy metal toxicity. 6  The extensive environmental distribution of cadmium has heightened\nconcerns regarding its disproportionate toxicity and adverse ecological\nconsequences. 6 , 7  Notably, Cd accumulates significantly\nin hepatic and renal tissues, initiating severe cellular damage across\nmultiple organ systems. 8 , 9  Cd finds widespread application\nin various industrial sectors, including paint manufacturing, silver-plating,\nbattery production, and agricultural practices. 6  Cigarette smoke is a well-recognized source of Cd exposure,\nsignificantly elevating the risk of contact. 10  Consequently, public exposure to Cd released into the environment\ndue to its diverse applications poses substantial health hazards. 4  Cd’s deleterious effects extend to soft\ntissues and cellular structures, including the liver and kidneys. 11 , 12  Despite being primarily known for its nephrotoxicity, mounting evidence\nlinks cadmium exposure to the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)\nand/or prediabetes. 13  Experimental studies\ninvolving both short-term and long-term  in vivo  Cd\nexposure have indicated its potential to induce hyperglycemia and\ndisrupt glucose homeostasis. 13  Notably,\nindividuals with elevated urinary cadmium levels tend to exhibit significantly\nlower fasting serum insulin levels compared to those without occupational\nCd exposure. 14  Mechanisms through which\nCd potentially influences glucose homeostasis encompass alterations\nin glucose transporter expression in adipocytes 15  as well as increased renal and hepatic gluconeogenesis. 16  These collective findings underscore Cd’s\nmultifaceted impact across various tissues, contributing to disrupted\nglucose homeostasis. The consumption of fruits and vegetables has\nbeen linked to a plethora of health benefits, attributed to their\nrich assortment of bioactive compounds. 15  Among these compounds, flavonoids, especially taxifolin, have emerged\nas pivotal players in mitigating various human ailments, including\ncancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative\ndisorders. Flavonoids, such as taxifolin, exhibit remarkable pharmacological\nactions and possess anticancer properties, including antiangiogenic\neffects, modulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, neutralization of\nreactive oxidative species (ROS), and induction of apoptosis. 17  Pine trees, notably  Pinus roxburghii  ( P. roxburghii ), indigenous to the\nHimalayan region, hold significant ecological and pharmacological\nimportance. 18  As members of the Pinus genus\nand Pinaceae family, these evergreen conifers make substantial contributions\nto their ecosystems. 19  Taxifolin, a flavonoid\nfound in these trees, has garnered attention due to its broad pharmacological\nactions, including its potential to counteract angiogenesis, influence\ncytochrome P450 enzymes, modulate P-glycoprotein, mitigate ROS effects,\nregulate the cell cycle, and induce apoptosis. 20\n\nWe hypothesized that exposure to cadmium chloride\n(CdCl 2 ), a pervasive environmental pollutant, induces impaired\ncarbohydrate\nmetabolism, insulin resistance, and diabetes, while the taxifolin-enriched\nextract from  P. roxburghii  holds therapeutic\npotential to counteract these effects. With the alarming rise in diabetes\ncases and its associated health burdens, understanding the impact\nof environmental pollutants like cadmium on metabolic health is crucial.\nOur aim was to rigorously investigate taxifolin’s protective\nproperties against CdCl 2 -induced metabolic disturbances,\noffering insights into mechanisms related to glucose metabolism, oxidative\nstress, and inflammation. We further expanded our study objectives\nto assess the effects of CdCl 2  on metabolic parameters,\nelucidate taxifolin’s therapeutic mechanisms, evaluate tissue\nhistopathology, and examine gene expression patterns.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\nCdCl 2  (purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich), Taxifolin (sourced from Macklin Biochemical Co., China),\nMetformin, ascorbic acid, and normal saline were employed as chemical\nreagents in this study. Additionally, a Cybergreen master mix (WizPure,\nobtained from Wizbiosolutions, Korea), a cDNA kit (WizScript, also\nprovided by Wizbiosolutions, Korea), primers (supplied by Thermo Fisher\nScientific), and ELISA kits for the measurement of antioxidant enzymes\n(acquired from Elabscience ELISA kit) were utilized. Analytical-grade\nchemicals were employed exclusively throughout all of the experimental\nprocedures.\n\nA taxifolin-enriched\nextract (TEE) was meticulously prepared following a previously established\nmethodology. 21  In a concise overview, the\ninitial step involved the extraction of a crude sample using an environmentally\nfriendly green extraction method, which involved soaking the source\nmaterial in ethyl acetate. Subsequently, silica gel column chromatography\nwas employed to facilitate fractionation of the obtained extract.\nThe fractions thus obtained were subjected to further purification\nthrough a combination of column chromatography and preparative thin-layer\nchromatography (prep-TLC) techniques. This multistep procedure ensured\nthe isolation and enrichment of taxifolin from the original source\nmaterial with a high degree of precision and purity.\n\nThe taxifolin-enriched\nextract was analyzed by using HPLC with a binary gradient solvent\nsystem. The liquid chromatography setup included a C18 column (250\n× 4.6 mm 2  internal diameter) with a 5 μm film\nthickness and an oven set at 30 °C. A Chromera HPLC system from\nPerkinElmer, equipped with a Flexar Binary LC pump and a UV/vis LC\nDetector (Shelton, CT), controlled by software version 4.2.6410, was\nemployed for data analysis. The mobile phase consisted of solvent\nA (acetonitrile/methanol, 70:30) and solvent B (double-distilled water\nwith 0.5% glacial acetic acid). UV spectra were recorded at 275 nm.\nAnalyte identification was achieved by matching retention times and\nspiking samples with standards, and quantification was performed using\nthe external standard method as described previously. 22\n\nThe experiments involving\nlaboratory animals were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines\nand approval of the Ethical Review Committee of Government College\nUniversity, Faisalabad, Pakistan (GCUF/ERC/35). A total of 60 albino\nrats, comprising both male and female individuals with an average\nbody weight ranging from 150 to 200 g, were utilized in the study.\nThese rats were housed in dedicated cages within the animal facility\nlocated in the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Government College\nUniversity, Faisalabad, Pakistan. During the acclimatization phase,\nthe rats were allowed to adapt to their environment, which was maintained\nat a temperature of 25 ± 5 °C, with humidity levels ranging\nfrom 45% to 70%. The photoperiod followed a standard 12 h light and\n12 h dark cycle. The rats were provided with a standard rodent diet\nduring this period. The experimental groups were defined as follows:\n\nGroup 1: Named CON, they received oral administration of normal\nsaline.\n\nGroup 2: Named as CdCl 2 , it was treated with\nCdCl 2  at a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight to induce metabolic\nimpairment.\n\nGroup 3: Named as MTF, treated with metformin at\na dose of 100\nmg/kg of body weight 1 h before the administration of CdCl 2  (30 mg/kg).\n\nGroup 4: Named as AA, treated with ascorbic acid\n(AA) at a dose\nof 100 mg/kg 1 h before the administration of CdCl 2  (30\nmg/kg).\n\nGroup 5: Named as TFN, treated with taxifolin (TFN)\nat a dose of\n30 mg/kg, also 1 h before the administration of CdCl 2  (30\nmg/kg).\n\nGroup 6: Named as TEE, treated with taxifolin-enriched\nextract\nat a dose of 30 mg/kg of body weight 1 h before the administration\nof CdCl 2  (30 mg/kg).\n\nThe collected blood samples\nwere left undisturbed to undergo coagulation at room temperature for\na duration of 20 min. Subsequently, the blood specimens were subjected\nto centrifugation at 3000 g  for 15 min. The resulting\nserum obtained post centrifugation was carefully preserved and stored\nat a temperature of −20 °C until it was ready for subsequent\nanalytical procedures.\n\nHyperglycemia is a\nphysiological state characterized by an elevated concentration of\nglucose in the circulatory system. It serves as a pivotal indicator\nof the presence of DM. To monitor the blood glucose levels in all\nexperimental animal groups, a glucometer (specifically, the Accu-Chek\nPerforma model) was employed to measure the glucose concentration\ntwice a week.\n\nA subgroup of 3–4\nanimals was systematically selected from each experimental group and\nhoused individually in cages, with the intention of conducting an\noral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The OGTT was carried out 2 days\nprior to the conclusion of the cadmium exposure period. The chosen\nanimals were subjected to a fasting period, refraining from both food\nand water consumption for a period spanning 4–6 h. Following\nthis fasting interval, a baseline blood sample was obtained from each\nanimal (0 min). Subsequently, an oral glucose challenge was administered\nvia gavage, wherein an anhydrous glucose solution was delivered at\na dosage of 1.75 g/kg of body weight. 23  Blood samples were collected at specific time intervals, namely,\n30, 60, 90, and 120 min postglucose administration. Each blood sample\nconsisted of 100 μL and was obtained from the tail veins of\nthe animals. These collected samples were then subjected to centrifugation\nfor a duration of 10 min at 400 g . The resultant serum\nwas carefully isolated and subsequently stored at a temperature of\n−70 °C, pending further analysis to determine the glucose\nand insulin levels.\n\nA subset of animals,\nspecifically 3–4 individuals from each experimental group,\nwere chosen to undergo an insulin tolerance test (ITT). These mice\nwere subjected to a period of fasting, abstaining from food intake\nfor a duration of 4–6 h. The subsequent ITT was conducted at\n10 am without the use of anesthesia to maintain physiological condition.\nBasal glycemia was assessed by collecting blood samples from the tail\nvein at the commencement of the experiment (0 min). Following the\nbaseline measurements, insulin was administered intraperitoneally\nat a dosage of 1 U/kg of body weight. Blood samples were subsequently\ncollected at specified time intervals, including 0, 30, 60, 90, and\n120 min postinsulin administration, with each sample being obtained\nfrom the tail vein. To evaluate insulin sensitivity, the glucose disappearance\nconstant (kITT) was determined. This constant was calculated by performing\na linear regression analysis on the Napierian logarithm of the glycemic\nvalues acquired during the 0–120 min period of the test.\n\nAn additional cohort\nof 3–4 animals was incorporated into the study and subjected\nto the Pyruvate tolerance test (PTT). In this experimental protocol,\nthe mice were subjected to a fasting period lasting 12 h and the subsequent\ntest was conducted at 8 AM. To ensure the animals’ comfort\nand compliance, anesthesia was administered using sodium pentobarbital\nat a dose of 60 mg/kg of body weight, delivered intraperitoneally.\nFollowing the induction of anesthesia, a pyruvate solution with a\nconcentration of 0.25 g/mL was administered intraperitoneally to the\nanimals at a dosage of 2 g/kg of body weight. Glycemia levels were\nmonitored by collecting blood samples from the tail vein at multiple\ntime points, including baseline (0 min) and subsequently at 30, 60,\n90, and 120 min following the pyruvate administration. To assess hepatic\nglucose production, the area under the curve of glycemia following\nthe pyruvate challenge was calculated using GraphPad Prism version\n5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). 24  This analysis provided insights into the animals’ response\nto pyruvate and their hepatic glucose production capacity.\n\nThe\nserum levels of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, specifically α-glucosidase\n(Catalog Number: E-EL-R1083, Elabscience), α-amylase (Catalog\nNumber: E-EL-R2544, Elabscience), skeletal muscle hexokinase (Catalog\nNumber: E-EL-RR0502, Elabscience), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(G6PDH) (Catalog Number: E-BC-K056-M, Elabscience), liver tissue phosphofructokinase\n(Catalog Number: E-BC-K612-M, Elabscience), and liver tissue glucose-6-phosphatase\n(G6PC) (Catalog Number: E-EL-M1362, Elabscience), were quantified\nutilizing the ELISA method. The measurements were conducted using\na Microplate ELISA reader (Bio Tek Instruments, Inc.).\n\nLiver tissues were\npromptly excised and subsequently homogenized in phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS) at a pH of 7.4. Following homogenization, centrifugation\nwas carried out and the resulting supernatant was collected for the\nassessment of various biochemical parameters. The activities of superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)\nin the tissue were determined in accordance with the manufacturer’s\ninstructions, utilizing commercially available assay kits.\n\nTo assess\nthe influence of heavy metal exposure on dyslipidemia, several key\nlipid control biomarkers, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL),\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TGs), were quantified\nfrom serum samples. The quantification of HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic\nenzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, was conducted utilizing\na microplate ELISA reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) in accordance\nwith the manufacturer’s instructions and a commercially available\nELISA kit (Catalog Number: E-EL-H2472, Elabscience).\n\nThe serum concentrations\nof inflammatory biomarkers, namely, interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Catalog\nNumber: E-EL-R0015, Elabscience) and tumor necrosis factor-α\n(TNF-α) (Catalog Number: E-EL-R0019, Elabscience), as well as\nadipokines, specifically, adiponectin (Catalog Number: E-BC-K013-S,\nElabscience) and leptin (Catalog Number: 201905, Elabscience), were\nquantified using commercially available ELISA kits. These measurements\nwere conducted with the aid of microplate ELISA.\n\nFollowing the homogenization of liver tissue,\ntotal RNA extraction was carried out employing Trizol reagent (Thermo\nFisher Scientific, MA) following the manufacturer’s guidelines.\nThe quantification of the total RNA yield was performed using a NanoDrop\n2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) at an absorbance of 260\nnm. Furthermore, the quality of RNA was assessed by visual examination\non a 1% agarose gel. Subsequently, 2 μg of total RNA was subjected\nto reverse transcription utilizing the RevertAid cDNA synthesis kit\nfrom Thermo Fisher Scientific. The amplification process was executed\nusing the Applied Biosystems Real-Time PCR System, with a final reaction\nvolume of 20 μL. The expression levels of the specified genes\n( Table  1 ) were analyzed\nduring the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For the PCR procedure,\nthe denaturation step was carried out at 95 °C for a duration\nof 15 s for all three genes. This was followed by 40 cycles consisting\nof denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s and annealing/extension at 60\n°C for 30 s.\n\nSmall segments of freshly\nexcised liver, pancreas, and kidney tissues were promptly submerged\nin a 10% formalin solution and subsequently embedded in paraffin wax\nto facilitate morphological studies. The paraffin-embedded sections\nwere subjected to staining using hematoxylin and eosin. Each prepared\nslide was thoroughly examined under a light microscope to conduct\nspecific morphological assessments.\n\n## Chemicals and Reagent\n\nCdCl 2  (purchased from\nSigma-Aldrich), Taxifolin (sourced from Macklin Biochemical Co., China),\nMetformin, ascorbic acid, and normal saline were employed as chemical\nreagents in this study.

It was observed that the administration of\nCdCl 2  significantly elevated ( P  < 0.001)\nthe body weight of animals in the treated group when compared to the\nCON animals ( Figure  2 A). However, the treatment with TEE led to a noticeable decline ( P  < 0.05) in body weight within the designated groups\nas compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  2 A). To investigate the impact\nof the treatment on glycemia, blood glucose levels were measured before,\nduring, and after the treatment regimen.

However, during the course\nof treatment, the serum insulin levels in the TFN and TEE groups exhibited\na significant decrease ( P  < 0.001) in comparison\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  2 D).\n\nEvaluation of the impact of treatment and CdCl 2  on (A)\nbody weight, (B) fasting blood glucose, (C) random blood glucose,\nand (D) serum insulin levels. The data is presented as mean ±\nSD. Significance levels were determined using a two-way ANOVA with\nBonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons. In the notation used,\n“a” denotes a significant difference when compared to\nthe control group, while “b” indicates a significant\ndifference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nIn the last\nweek, just before the completion of the treatment period, OGTT was\nconducted to assess the influence of TFN and TEE on blood glucose\nlevels following an overnight fasting period. Prior to the administration\nof a defined quantity of glucose based on the animals’ body\nweight, fasting blood sugar and serum insulin levels were determined.\nSubsequently, blood glucose levels were measured at predetermined\ntime intervals of 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The results revealed that\nthe CdCl 2 -treated group exhibited the highest blood glucose\nlevels ( P  < 0.001) after 30 min, and these elevated\nlevels persisted up to the 120 min mark, in contrast to the CON-,\nAA-, TFN-, and TEE-treated groups ( Figure  3 A). Conversely, the treatment with TEE, TFN,\nand AA demonstrated a progressive hypoglycemic effect ( P  < 0.001) when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group\n( Figure  3 A).\n\nImpact of treatment\nand CdCl 2  on (A) blood glucose level,\n(B) insulin tolerance test blood glucose level, (C) Homeostatic Model\nAssessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and (D) area under the\ncurve (AUC). Data are presented as mean ± SD. Significance levels\nwere determined using a two-way ANOVA for (A, B) and one-way ANOVA\nfor (C, D), followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b″ denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\nIn the final week of the experiment, just before its completion,\nan insulin tolerance test was conducted. Following a fasting period\nof 4–6 h, animals received a predetermined quantity of insulin,\nand their blood glucose levels were monitored at 0, 30, 60, 90, and\n120 min intervals. The results indicated that the CdCl 2 -treated group exhibited significantly higher blood glucose levels\n( P  < 0.001) compared to the CON group ( Figure  2 B). However, treatment\nwith TEE markedly reduced blood glucose levels ( P  < 0.001) in the TEE group when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group. Additionally, it also led to a reduction in the area\nunder the curve (AUC) ( Figure  3 B,D). To assess insulin resistance based on fasting blood\nglucose levels and serum insulin levels, the Homeostatic Model Assessment\nof Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. It was evident that\nthe CdCl 2 -treated group exhibited significantly greater\ninsulin resistance ( P  < 0.001) compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  3 C). However, treatment with TFN, TEE, and AA improved CdCl 2 -induced insulin resistance in the TFN, TEE, and AA groups, respectively,\nsimilar to that in the MTF-treated animals in the MTF group ( Figure  3 C).\n\nTo assess\nthe impact of TEE on gluconeogenesis, animals underwent a fasting\nperiod of 6–8 h to deplete hepatic glycogen reserves. Following\nthis fasting period, pyruvate was administered as a substrate to the\nanimals. Pyruvate significantly elevated blood glucose levels in the\nCdCl 2 -treated group after 30 min when compared to the CON\ngroup ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 A). In the CdCl 2  group, blood\nsugar levels remained persistently elevated from 30 to 120 min and\ndid not return to basal levels. However, treatment with TEE markedly\ndecreased blood glucose levels to basal values after 120 min ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 A). TFN, AA, and MTF also progressively decreased blood\nglucose levels after 120 min compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup ( Figure  4 A).\nTo further evaluate the effect of TEE on blood glucose levels, an\nanalysis of the area under the curve (AUC) was performed. In the CdCl 2 -treated group, the AUC was significantly higher compared\nto the CON group ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 B). However, treatment with\nTEE significantly reduced both blood glucose levels and the AUC compared\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group ( P  < 0.001)\n( Figure  4 B). Similarly,\nTFN, AA, and MTF also significantly reduced the AUC compared to the\nCdCl 2 -treated group ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 B).\n\nImpact of treatment and\nCdCl2 on (A) pyruvate tolerance test and\n(B) the area under the curve for the pyruvate tolerance test. Data\nis presented as mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined\nusing (A) a two-way ANOVA and (B) a one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni\npost-test for multiple comparisons. In the notation used, “a”\nindicates a significant difference when compared to the control group,\nwhile “b” denotes a significant difference when compared\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nIt was\nobserved that CdCl 2  administration significantly impaired\ncarbohydrate metabolism, leading to elevated levels of α-amylase\nand α-glucosidase in the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  5 A,B). However, treatment\nwith TEE significantly reduced the levels of α-amylase and α-glucosidase\nin the TEE group more effectively when compared to the TFN treatment\nin the TFN group ( Figure  5 A,B).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on (A) α-amylase\nand (B) α-glucosidase. Data are presented as mean ± SD.\nSignificance levels were determined using a one-way ANOVA, followed\nby Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons. In the notation\nused, “a” indicates a significant difference when compared\nto the control group, while “b” denotes a significant\ndifference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nG6P activity was significantly increased ( P  <\n0.001) in the CdCl 2 -treated group due to CdCl 2  treatment. However, treatment with TEE induced a notable decline,\nrestoring glucose-6-phosphatase levels to a normal range in the TEE\ngroup ( Figure  6 A).\nTaxifolin, ascorbic acid, and metformin also successfully reversed\nabnormally elevated levels of G6P ( Figure  6 A). CdCl 2  treatment significantly\nincreased hexokinase levels ( P  < 0.001) in the\nCdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  6 B). Nonetheless, administration of TEE, TFN, MTF, and\nAA significantly reduced the elevated hexokinase levels in the TEE,\nTFN, MTF, and AA groups ( Figure  6 B). Phosphofructokinase activity was markedly decreased\n( P  < 0.001) in the CdCl 2 -treated group\ncompared to the control group (CON) ( Figure  6 C). However, treatment TEE significantly\n( P  < 0.001) restored phosphofructokinase activity\nin the TEE group ( Figure  6 C). TFN, MTF, and AA also improved the decreased phosphofructokinase\nactivity in the TFN, MTF, and AA groups ( Figure  6 C). Similarly, TEE treatment significantly\nincreased ( P  < 0.001) the activity of G6PDH in\nthe TEE group compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  6 D). TFN, AA, and\nMTF also increased the G6PDH activity in the TFN, AA, and MTF groups,\nrespectively ( Figure  6 D).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on the serum levels of\n(A) glucose-6-phosphatase and (B) hexokinase, as well as on the activity\nof (C) phosphofructokinase and (D) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\nData is presented as mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined\nusing a one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple\ncomparisons. In the notation used, “a” indicates a significant\ndifference when compared to the control group, while “b”\ndenotes a significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nTEE exhibited significant antioxidant potential by modulating the\nactivity of the first-line antioxidant enzymes. It was observed that\nCdCl 2  treatment led to a decrease in the levels of CAT,\nSOD, and GPx in the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  7 A–C). However, treatment\nwith taxifolin-enriched extract markedly restored these antioxidant\nenzyme levels ( P  < 0.05) in the TEE group ( Figure  7 A–C). In the\nTFN group, TFN also improved the levels of antioxidant enzymes, although\nto a comparatively lesser extent when compared with the TEE in the\nTEE group ( Figure  7 A–C).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on first-line\nantioxidant\nenzymes, namely, (A) catalase, (B) superoxide dismutase, and (C) glutathione\nperoxidase. Data is presented as mean ± SD. Significance levels\nwere determined using a one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test\nfor multiple comparisons. In the notation used, “a”\nindicates a significant difference when compared to the control group,\nwhile “b” denotes a significant difference when compared\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nThe evaluation\nof lipid biomarkers, including HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and HMG-CoA\nreductase, was conducted. As a result of cadmium chloride administration,\nthe serum levels of HDL significantly decreased when compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  8 A). However, treatment with TEE, TFN, MTF, and AA notably restored\nthe abnormally decreased HDL levels in the TFN, MFT, and AA groups\nwhen compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  8 A). Conversely, the serum levels of LDL,\nTGs, and HMG-CoA reductase significantly increased ( P  < 0.05) in the CdCl 2 -treated group compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  8 B–D). Treatment with TEE, TFN, MTF, and AA effectively reversed\nthese abnormal increases in these parameters in the TFN, MFT, and\nAA groups when compared to those in the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  8 B–D).\n\nImpact of treatment\nand CdCl 2  on the serum levels of\n(A) HDL, (B) LDL, (C) TGs, and (D) HMG-CoA reductase.

Significance levels were determined using a one-way\nANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\nIn the\nCdCl 2 -treated group, it was observed that the administration\nof CdCl 2  significantly increased the levels of leptin and\nadiponectin, as well as inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6)\nwhen compared to the CON group ( Figure  8 A–D). However, treatment with TEE led to a significant\nreduction ( P  < 0.05) in the release of inflammatory\nmarkers IL-6 and TNF-α, thereby mitigating the inflammatory\nresponses ( Figure  9 C,D). Additionally, TEE treatment decreased the level of leptin by\nreducing the excessive release of leptin and adiponectin from adipose\ntissues, as observed in the TEE group ( Figure  9 A,B). Similarly, TFN, AA, and MTF also decreased\n( P  < 0.05) the liberation of inflammatory cytokines\nIL-6 and TNF-α in the TFF, MTF, and AA groups, although to a\nlesser extent compared to the taxifolin extract treatment in the TEE\ngroup ( Figure  9 C,D).\n\nImpact\nof treatment and CdCl 2  on serum levels of (A)\nleptin, (B) adiponectin, (C) IL-6, and (D) TNF-α. The data is\npresented as mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined using\na one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\nCdCl 2  treatment markedly increased ( P  < 0.05)\nthe levels of AST and ALT in the CdCl 2  group when compared\nto the CON group ( Figure  10 A,B). However, treatment with TEE exhibited a hepatoprotective\neffect by significantly reducing the levels of AST and ALT in the\nTEE group. In the TFN, MTF, and AA groups, the elevated levels of\nAST and ALT also improved but to a lesser extent compared to those\nin the TEE group ( Figure  10 A,B). CdCl 2  treatment significantly elevated ( P  < 0.05) the levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum\ncreatinine in the CdCl 2  group in comparison to the CON\ngroup ( Figure  10 C,D).\nNevertheless, treatment with TEE significantly ameliorated the increased\nlevels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine when compared to all\nother treatment groups ( Figure  10 C,D).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on serum levels\nof (A)\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), (B) alanine transaminase (ALT),\n(C) blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and (D) creatinine. Data is presented\nas mean ± SD. The level of significant difference was determined\nusing one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\nCdCl 2  administration\nsignificantly downregulated ( P  < 0.001) the mRNA\nexpression of IGF-1 and GLUT2 in the CdCl 2  group compared\nto the CON group ( Figure  10 A,B). However, treatment with TEE, TFN, AA, and MTF mitigated\n( P  < 0.001) the mRNA expression of these genes,\nsimilar to the CON group ( Figure  11 A,B). CdCl 2  intoxication induced downregulation\n( P  < 0.001) in mRNA expression of HMG-CoA lyase\nin the CdCl 2  group compared to the CON ( Figure  11 C). However, TEE markedly\nimproved ( P  < 0.001) the downregulated expression\nof HMG-CoA lyase compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  11 C). TFN, AA, and\nMTF also mitigated the expression, but to a lesser extent compared\nto TEE in the TEE group ( Figure  11 C). Angiotensin receptor II and lactate dehydrogenase\nexpression were significantly upregulated ( P  <\n0.001) in the CdCl 2  group compared to the control, TEE,\nTFN, AA, and MTF groups ( Figure  10 D,E). However, taxifolin-enriched extract treatment\nnotably downregulated ( P  < 0.001) the mRNA expression\nof angiotensin receptor II and lactate dehydrogenase, similar to the\ncontrol group in the TEE group ( Figure  11 D,E). Similarly, in mRNA expression of vasopressin,\ndownregulation ( P  < 0.001) was observed in the\nCdCl 2  group compared to the control ( Figure  10 F). Taxifolin-enriched extract\nmarkedly improved ( P  < 0.001) the downregulated\nexpression of vasopressin compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  11 F). However, TFN,\nAA, and MTF also lessened the expression, but to a lesser extent compared\nto TEE in the TEE group ( Figure  11 F).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on mRNA expression\nof\n(A) IGF-1, (B) GLUT2, (C) HMG-CoA lyase, (D) angiotensin II receptor,\n(E) lactate dehydrogenase, and (F) vasopressin. Data are presented\nas mean ± SD. The level of significant difference was calculated\nby one-way ANOVA using Bonferroni post-test. “a” represents\na significant difference when compared with the control group, while\n“b” represents a significant difference when compared\nwith the CdCl 2  group.\n\nHistopathological examination revealed that the CON group exhibited\na normal architecture of hepatic tissues with well-defined nuclei,\nchromatin material, intact parenchyma, and organized hepatic cords.\nIn contrast, the CdCl 2  group showed disrupted hepatic cords,\ninflammation, cytoplasmic fat droplet deposition, and infiltration\nof inflammatory mediators. However, treatment with the taxifolin-enriched\nextract and taxifolin demonstrated improvements in histopathological\nfeatures, including the restoration of normal sinusoidal spaces, prominent\nnuclei, and the absence of hepatocyte inflammation ( Figure  12 ). The CON group displayed\na normal appearance and a healthy distribution of Islets of Langerhans\nwithin the pancreas parenchyma. In the CdCl 2  group, there\nwas a significant decrease in the number of Islets of Langerhans,\nindicating necrotic changes and impaired insulin production. However,\nin the TEE group, the number of healthy Islets of Langerhans was markedly\nrestored compared to that in the TFN, MTF, and AA groups, demonstrating\nthe restorative function of the pancreas. Microscopic examination\nof the kidneys in the CdCl 2  group revealed vacuolar degenerations\nand glomerular lesions. Kidney histopathological analysis further\nindicated thickening of the basement membrane, tubular lesions, mononuclear\ncell and leukocyte infiltration, edema, and granular deposit formation\ndue to CdCl 2  administration. These pathological hallmarks\nwere mitigated and improved in the TEE and TFN groups compared to\nthose in other treatment groups and the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  12 ).\n\nImpact of treatment\nand CdCl 2  on kidney, liver, and\npancreas histopathology: kidney histopathology: tubular vacuolization\nand dilation (yellow arrow), pyknotic tubular nucleus (black arrow),\ninfiltration of leukocytes and mononuclear cells (red arrow), hemorrhage,\nand congestion (green arrow). Liver histopathology: blood sinusoids\nand congestion (a), infiltration of inflammatory cells (b), cytoplasmic\nvacuolation (c), and hepatic cell necrosis (d). Pancreas histopathology:\nblood sinusoids (circle shape), infiltration of inflammatory cells\n(rectangle shape), fatty changes (hexagonal shape), and apoptotic\nchanges (triangle shape).\n\n## HPLC Analysis of Taxifolin-Enriched Extract\n\nMethanol\nunderwent column chromatography fractionation to isolate taxifolin\nand subsequent confirmation of taxifolin presence and purity using\nthin-layer chromatography (TLC). Quantification of taxifolin concentration\nwas accomplished through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\nwith UV/vis detection, revealing a concentration of 0.16 mg/mL ( Figure  1 ). This process ensures\nthe extraction, isolation, and precise measurement of taxifolin, making\nit a valuable resource for potential pharmaceutical applications or\nresearch endeavors.\n\nChromatogram of the Taxifolin-enriched extract.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Body Weight and Glycemic Markers\n\nThe body weight of the animals was assessed on a weekly basis both\nprior to the initiation of the treatment, during the treatment period,\nand upon its completion. It was observed that the administration of\nCdCl 2  significantly elevated ( P  < 0.001)\nthe body weight of animals in the treated group when compared to the\nCON animals ( Figure  2 A). However, the treatment with TEE led to a noticeable decline ( P  < 0.05) in body weight within the designated groups\nas compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  2 A). To investigate the impact\nof the treatment on glycemia, blood glucose levels were measured before,\nduring, and after the treatment regimen. Fasting and random blood\nglucose measurements for all animals in their respective groups revealed\nthat CdCl 2  administration significantly increased fasting\nblood glucose levels ( P  < 0.001) and random blood\nglucose levels ( P  < 0.001) in comparison to the\nCON group ( Figure  1 B,C). However, it became evident that during the final week of the\nexperiment, AA, TFN, and TEE induced a significant progressive hypoglycemic\neffect when compared to that of the CdCl 2 -treated group,\nas reflected in both fasting and random blood glucose levels ( Figure  2 B,C). Furthermore,\nthe serum levels of insulin were measured before the commencement\nof the experiment, during the treatment period, and upon its completion.\nIt was observed that CdCl 2  treatment significantly increased\nthe serum insulin levels ( P  < 0.001) in the CdCl 2 -treated group when compared to the CON group ( Figure  1 D). However, during the course\nof treatment, the serum insulin levels in the TFN and TEE groups exhibited\na significant decrease ( P  < 0.001) in comparison\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  2 D).\n\nEvaluation of the impact of treatment and CdCl 2  on (A)\nbody weight, (B) fasting blood glucose, (C) random blood glucose,\nand (D) serum insulin levels. The data is presented as mean ±\nSD. Significance levels were determined using a two-way ANOVA with\nBonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons. In the notation used,\n“a” denotes a significant difference when compared to\nthe control group, while “b” indicates a significant\ndifference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Glucose Tolerance\n\nIn the last\nweek, just before the completion of the treatment period, OGTT was\nconducted to assess the influence of TFN and TEE on blood glucose\nlevels following an overnight fasting period. Prior to the administration\nof a defined quantity of glucose based on the animals’ body\nweight, fasting blood sugar and serum insulin levels were determined.\nSubsequently, blood glucose levels were measured at predetermined\ntime intervals of 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The results revealed that\nthe CdCl 2 -treated group exhibited the highest blood glucose\nlevels ( P  < 0.001) after 30 min, and these elevated\nlevels persisted up to the 120 min mark, in contrast to the CON-,\nAA-, TFN-, and TEE-treated groups ( Figure  3 A). Conversely, the treatment with TEE, TFN,\nand AA demonstrated a progressive hypoglycemic effect ( P  < 0.001) when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group\n( Figure  3 A).\n\nImpact of treatment\nand CdCl 2  on (A) blood glucose level,\n(B) insulin tolerance test blood glucose level, (C) Homeostatic Model\nAssessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and (D) area under the\ncurve (AUC).

Significance levels\nwere determined using a two-way ANOVA for (A, B) and one-way ANOVA\nfor (C, D), followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b″ denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Insulin Sensitivity and Resistance\n\nIn the final week of the experiment, just before its completion,\nan insulin tolerance test was conducted. Following a fasting period\nof 4–6 h, animals received a predetermined quantity of insulin,\nand their blood glucose levels were monitored at 0, 30, 60, 90, and\n120 min intervals. The results indicated that the CdCl 2 -treated group exhibited significantly higher blood glucose levels\n( P  < 0.001) compared to the CON group ( Figure  2 B). However, treatment\nwith TEE markedly reduced blood glucose levels ( P  < 0.001) in the TEE group when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group. Additionally, it also led to a reduction in the area\nunder the curve (AUC) ( Figure  3 B,D). To assess insulin resistance based on fasting blood\nglucose levels and serum insulin levels, the Homeostatic Model Assessment\nof Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. It was evident that\nthe CdCl 2 -treated group exhibited significantly greater\ninsulin resistance ( P  < 0.001) compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  3 C). However, treatment with TFN, TEE, and AA improved CdCl 2 -induced insulin resistance in the TFN, TEE, and AA groups, respectively,\nsimilar to that in the MTF-treated animals in the MTF group ( Figure  3 C).\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Pyruvate Tolerance\n\nTo assess\nthe impact of TEE on gluconeogenesis, animals underwent a fasting\nperiod of 6–8 h to deplete hepatic glycogen reserves. Following\nthis fasting period, pyruvate was administered as a substrate to the\nanimals. Pyruvate significantly elevated blood glucose levels in the\nCdCl 2 -treated group after 30 min when compared to the CON\ngroup ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 A). In the CdCl 2  group, blood\nsugar levels remained persistently elevated from 30 to 120 min and\ndid not return to basal levels. However, treatment with TEE markedly\ndecreased blood glucose levels to basal values after 120 min ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 A). TFN, AA, and MTF also progressively decreased blood\nglucose levels after 120 min compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup ( Figure  4 A).\nTo further evaluate the effect of TEE on blood glucose levels, an\nanalysis of the area under the curve (AUC) was performed. In the CdCl 2 -treated group, the AUC was significantly higher compared\nto the CON group ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 B). However, treatment with\nTEE significantly reduced both blood glucose levels and the AUC compared\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group ( P  < 0.001)\n( Figure  4 B). Similarly,\nTFN, AA, and MTF also significantly reduced the AUC compared to the\nCdCl 2 -treated group ( P  < 0.001) ( Figure  4 B).\n\nImpact of treatment and\nCdCl2 on (A) pyruvate tolerance test and\n(B) the area under the curve for the pyruvate tolerance test. Data\nis presented as mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined\nusing (A) a two-way ANOVA and (B) a one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni\npost-test for multiple comparisons. In the notation used, “a”\nindicates a significant difference when compared to the control group,\nwhile “b” denotes a significant difference when compared\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Carbohydrate Metabolism\n\nIt was\nobserved that CdCl 2  administration significantly impaired\ncarbohydrate metabolism, leading to elevated levels of α-amylase\nand α-glucosidase in the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  5 A,B). However, treatment\nwith TEE significantly reduced the levels of α-amylase and α-glucosidase\nin the TEE group more effectively when compared to the TFN treatment\nin the TFN group ( Figure  5 A,B).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on (A) α-amylase\nand (B) α-glucosidase. Data are presented as mean ± SD.\nSignificance levels were determined using a one-way ANOVA, followed\nby Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons. In the notation\nused, “a” indicates a significant difference when compared\nto the control group, while “b” denotes a significant\ndifference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\nG6P activity was significantly increased ( P  <\n0.001) in the CdCl 2 -treated group due to CdCl 2  treatment. However, treatment with TEE induced a notable decline,\nrestoring glucose-6-phosphatase levels to a normal range in the TEE\ngroup ( Figure  6 A).\nTaxifolin, ascorbic acid, and metformin also successfully reversed\nabnormally elevated levels of G6P ( Figure  6 A). CdCl 2  treatment significantly\nincreased hexokinase levels ( P  < 0.001) in the\nCdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  6 B). Nonetheless, administration of TEE, TFN, MTF, and\nAA significantly reduced the elevated hexokinase levels in the TEE,\nTFN, MTF, and AA groups ( Figure  6 B). Phosphofructokinase activity was markedly decreased\n( P  < 0.001) in the CdCl 2 -treated group\ncompared to the control group (CON) ( Figure  6 C). However, treatment TEE significantly\n( P  < 0.001) restored phosphofructokinase activity\nin the TEE group ( Figure  6 C). TFN, MTF, and AA also improved the decreased phosphofructokinase\nactivity in the TFN, MTF, and AA groups ( Figure  6 C). Similarly, TEE treatment significantly\nincreased ( P  < 0.001) the activity of G6PDH in\nthe TEE group compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  6 D). TFN, AA, and\nMTF also increased the G6PDH activity in the TFN, AA, and MTF groups,\nrespectively ( Figure  6 D).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on the serum levels of\n(A) glucose-6-phosphatase and (B) hexokinase, as well as on the activity\nof (C) phosphofructokinase and (D) glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\nData is presented as mean ± SD.

In the notation used, “a” indicates a significant\ndifference when compared to the control group, while “b”\ndenotes a significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Antioxidant Enzymes Capacity\n\nTEE exhibited significant antioxidant potential by modulating the\nactivity of the first-line antioxidant enzymes. It was observed that\nCdCl 2  treatment led to a decrease in the levels of CAT,\nSOD, and GPx in the CdCl 2 -treated group ( Figure  7 A–C). However, treatment\nwith taxifolin-enriched extract markedly restored these antioxidant\nenzyme levels ( P  < 0.05) in the TEE group ( Figure  7 A–C). In the\nTFN group, TFN also improved the levels of antioxidant enzymes, although\nto a comparatively lesser extent when compared with the TEE in the\nTEE group ( Figure  7 A–C).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on first-line\nantioxidant\nenzymes, namely, (A) catalase, (B) superoxide dismutase, and (C) glutathione\nperoxidase.

In the notation used, “a”\nindicates a significant difference when compared to the control group,\nwhile “b” denotes a significant difference when compared\nto the CdCl 2 -treated group.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Lipid Profile\n\nThe evaluation\nof lipid biomarkers, including HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and HMG-CoA\nreductase, was conducted. As a result of cadmium chloride administration,\nthe serum levels of HDL significantly decreased when compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  8 A). However, treatment with TEE, TFN, MTF, and AA notably restored\nthe abnormally decreased HDL levels in the TFN, MFT, and AA groups\nwhen compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  8 A). Conversely, the serum levels of LDL,\nTGs, and HMG-CoA reductase significantly increased ( P  < 0.05) in the CdCl 2 -treated group compared to the\nCON group ( Figure  8 B–D). Treatment with TEE, TFN, MTF, and AA effectively reversed\nthese abnormal increases in these parameters in the TFN, MFT, and\nAA groups when compared to those in the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  8 B–D).\n\nImpact of treatment\nand CdCl 2  on the serum levels of\n(A) HDL, (B) LDL, (C) TGs, and (D) HMG-CoA reductase. Data is presented\nas mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined using a one-way\nANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Inflammatory Cytokines\n\nIn the\nCdCl 2 -treated group, it was observed that the administration\nof CdCl 2  significantly increased the levels of leptin and\nadiponectin, as well as inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6)\nwhen compared to the CON group ( Figure  8 A–D). However, treatment with TEE led to a significant\nreduction ( P  < 0.05) in the release of inflammatory\nmarkers IL-6 and TNF-α, thereby mitigating the inflammatory\nresponses ( Figure  9 C,D). Additionally, TEE treatment decreased the level of leptin by\nreducing the excessive release of leptin and adiponectin from adipose\ntissues, as observed in the TEE group ( Figure  9 A,B). Similarly, TFN, AA, and MTF also decreased\n( P  < 0.05) the liberation of inflammatory cytokines\nIL-6 and TNF-α in the TFF, MTF, and AA groups, although to a\nlesser extent compared to the taxifolin extract treatment in the TEE\ngroup ( Figure  9 C,D).\n\nImpact\nof treatment and CdCl 2  on serum levels of (A)\nleptin, (B) adiponectin, (C) IL-6, and (D) TNF-α. The data is\npresented as mean ± SD. Significance levels were determined using\na one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Liver and Kidney Functions\n\nCdCl 2  treatment markedly increased ( P  < 0.05)\nthe levels of AST and ALT in the CdCl 2  group when compared\nto the CON group ( Figure  10 A,B). However, treatment with TEE exhibited a hepatoprotective\neffect by significantly reducing the levels of AST and ALT in the\nTEE group. In the TFN, MTF, and AA groups, the elevated levels of\nAST and ALT also improved but to a lesser extent compared to those\nin the TEE group ( Figure  10 A,B). CdCl 2  treatment significantly elevated ( P  < 0.05) the levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum\ncreatinine in the CdCl 2  group in comparison to the CON\ngroup ( Figure  10 C,D).\nNevertheless, treatment with TEE significantly ameliorated the increased\nlevels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine when compared to all\nother treatment groups ( Figure  10 C,D).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on serum levels\nof (A)\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), (B) alanine transaminase (ALT),\n(C) blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and (D) creatinine. Data is presented\nas mean ± SD. The level of significant difference was determined\nusing one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test for multiple comparisons.\nIn the notation used, “a” indicates a significant difference\nwhen compared to the control group, while “b” denotes\na significant difference when compared to the CdCl 2 -treated\ngroup.\n\n## Effect of Gene Expression of Debilitated Carbohydrate and Lipid\nMetabolism-Associated Genes\n\nCdCl 2  administration\nsignificantly downregulated ( P  < 0.001) the mRNA\nexpression of IGF-1 and GLUT2 in the CdCl 2  group compared\nto the CON group ( Figure  10 A,B). However, treatment with TEE, TFN, AA, and MTF mitigated\n( P  < 0.001) the mRNA expression of these genes,\nsimilar to the CON group ( Figure  11 A,B). CdCl 2  intoxication induced downregulation\n( P  < 0.001) in mRNA expression of HMG-CoA lyase\nin the CdCl 2  group compared to the CON ( Figure  11 C). However, TEE markedly\nimproved ( P  < 0.001) the downregulated expression\nof HMG-CoA lyase compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  11 C). TFN, AA, and\nMTF also mitigated the expression, but to a lesser extent compared\nto TEE in the TEE group ( Figure  11 C). Angiotensin receptor II and lactate dehydrogenase\nexpression were significantly upregulated ( P  <\n0.001) in the CdCl 2  group compared to the control, TEE,\nTFN, AA, and MTF groups ( Figure  10 D,E). However, taxifolin-enriched extract treatment\nnotably downregulated ( P  < 0.001) the mRNA expression\nof angiotensin receptor II and lactate dehydrogenase, similar to the\ncontrol group in the TEE group ( Figure  11 D,E). Similarly, in mRNA expression of vasopressin,\ndownregulation ( P  < 0.001) was observed in the\nCdCl 2  group compared to the control ( Figure  10 F). Taxifolin-enriched extract\nmarkedly improved ( P  < 0.001) the downregulated\nexpression of vasopressin compared to the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  11 F). However, TFN,\nAA, and MTF also lessened the expression, but to a lesser extent compared\nto TEE in the TEE group ( Figure  11 F).\n\nImpact of treatment and CdCl 2  on mRNA expression\nof\n(A) IGF-1, (B) GLUT2, (C) HMG-CoA lyase, (D) angiotensin II receptor,\n(E) lactate dehydrogenase, and (F) vasopressin. Data are presented\nas mean ± SD. The level of significant difference was calculated\nby one-way ANOVA using Bonferroni post-test. “a” represents\na significant difference when compared with the control group, while\n“b” represents a significant difference when compared\nwith the CdCl 2  group.\n\n## Effect of Treatment on Histopathology of Vital Organs\n\nHistopathological examination revealed that the CON group exhibited\na normal architecture of hepatic tissues with well-defined nuclei,\nchromatin material, intact parenchyma, and organized hepatic cords.\nIn contrast, the CdCl 2  group showed disrupted hepatic cords,\ninflammation, cytoplasmic fat droplet deposition, and infiltration\nof inflammatory mediators. However, treatment with the taxifolin-enriched\nextract and taxifolin demonstrated improvements in histopathological\nfeatures, including the restoration of normal sinusoidal spaces, prominent\nnuclei, and the absence of hepatocyte inflammation ( Figure  12 ). The CON group displayed\na normal appearance and a healthy distribution of Islets of Langerhans\nwithin the pancreas parenchyma. In the CdCl 2  group, there\nwas a significant decrease in the number of Islets of Langerhans,\nindicating necrotic changes and impaired insulin production. However,\nin the TEE group, the number of healthy Islets of Langerhans was markedly\nrestored compared to that in the TFN, MTF, and AA groups, demonstrating\nthe restorative function of the pancreas. Microscopic examination\nof the kidneys in the CdCl 2  group revealed vacuolar degenerations\nand glomerular lesions. Kidney histopathological analysis further\nindicated thickening of the basement membrane, tubular lesions, mononuclear\ncell and leukocyte infiltration, edema, and granular deposit formation\ndue to CdCl 2  administration. These pathological hallmarks\nwere mitigated and improved in the TEE and TFN groups compared to\nthose in other treatment groups and the CdCl 2  group ( Figure  12 ).\n\nImpact of treatment\nand CdCl 2  on kidney, liver, and\npancreas histopathology: kidney histopathology: tubular vacuolization\nand dilation (yellow arrow), pyknotic tubular nucleus (black arrow),\ninfiltration of leukocytes and mononuclear cells (red arrow), hemorrhage,\nand congestion (green arrow). Liver histopathology: blood sinusoids\nand congestion (a), infiltration of inflammatory cells (b), cytoplasmic\nvacuolation (c), and hepatic cell necrosis (d). Pancreas histopathology:\nblood sinusoids (circle shape), infiltration of inflammatory cells\n(rectangle shape), fatty changes (hexagonal shape), and apoptotic\nchanges (triangle shape).\n\n## Discussion\n\nOver the past 5 decades, research has established\nthe role of inorganic\nmetals in disrupting insulin and glucose homeostasis in target tissues.\nInorganic metals, such as Cd, have been shown to induce metabolic\ndisorders that impair β-cell function and contribute to the\ndevelopment of T2DM. The deleterious effects of Cd on metabolic pathways,\nparticularly carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, have garnered increasing\nattention due to their potential role in the development of metabolic\ndisorders such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Cd exposure\nhas been linked to impaired carbohydrate metabolism, which is characterized\nby insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Cd disrupts insulin\nsignaling pathways, reducing the sensitivity of target tissues to\ninsulin, and thereby impairing glucose uptake. This leads to elevated\nblood glucose levels, a hallmark of DM. Additionally, Cd interferes\nwith glucose homeostasis by modulating genes involved in glycometabolism\nsuch as GLUT2 and IGF-1. These disruptions in glucose metabolism can\nset the stage for the development of T2DM. Furthermore, Cd exerts\na detrimental effect on lipid metabolism. It disrupts the balance\nbetween HDL and LDL cholesterol, leading to dyslipidemia characterized\nby elevated LDL cholesterol and TGs, along with decreased HDL cholesterol\nlevels. Cd-induced oxidative stress and inflammation further exacerbate\nlipid dysregulation, contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis\nand cardiovascular diseases. Cd’s association with metabolic\nimpairment, particularly in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, highlights\nits potential role as a significant risk factor for metabolic disorders.\nUnderstanding the mechanisms underlying Cd’s disruptive effects\non these metabolic pathways is crucial for developing strategies to\nmitigate its adverse health outcomes. The study’s findings\nsuggest that TEE may hold promise in counteracting Cd-induced metabolic\ndisturbances, offering hope for potential therapeutic interventions\nin individuals exposed to environmental Cd contamination.\n\nIn\nthe present study, our focus is on Cd-induced impairment of\ncarbohydrate metabolism and the development of DM. Cd was selected\nfor this study due to its high presence in soil, its uptake by plants,\nand its resulting dietary consumption, which raises serious public\nhealth concerns. Additionally, cigarette smoke is another source of\nthis toxic metal as smokers have been found to have higher serum levels\nof Cd. Recent research has indicated that Cd plays a role in metabolic\ndisruption through the modulation of gene expression, oxidative stress,\nand inflammatory cytokines. Human clinical studies and animal studies\nhave demonstrated that Cd has the ability to accumulate in the pancreas\nand induce pancreatotoxic effects. In recent decades, the role of\nCd in the development of DM and insulin resistance has been reported,\naffecting processes such as glycogenesis, glucose filtration, and\ngluconeogenesis. Therefore, in the current study, a diabetic rat model\ninduced by Cd consumption was established to investigate the effects\nof Cd on the carbohydrate metabolism and diabetes-related complications.\n\nP. roxburghii  is rich in taxifolin,\na bioactive compound known for its diverse pharmacological activities.\nIn our current study, we prepared a taxifolin-enriched extract from  P. roxburghii  and investigated its protective potential\nagainst CdCl 2 -induced metabolic impairments and DM. In\nour rat model, CdCl 2  administration led to increased body\nweight, fasting, and random blood sugar levels during the experimental\nperiod. In our current study, TEE reduced body weight, fasting, and\nrandom blood sugar levels, consistent with its reported actions. Studies\nby Gao et al., 25  Zhao et al. 26  have documented the antidiabetic effects of\nTFN through the modulation of glucose metabolism via the PI3K/AKT\nantioxidant signaling pathways. In our study, treatment with TEE reduced\nblood glucose levels in the glucose tolerance test, aligning with\nthe previously reported actions of taxifolin. 26\n\nThe ITT is considered the gold standard for investigating\nglucocorticoid\ndepletion. Following an overnight fast, insulin is administered, and\nblood samples are collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min intervals to\nassess blood glucose levels. The rate of plasma glucose disappearance,\ndenoted as kITT, is then estimated to determine insulin sensitivity.\nIn the current study, CdCl 2  administration resulted in\nan increase in serum insulin levels due to impaired glucose metabolism.\nHowever, treatment with TEE and TFN reduced serum insulin levels and\nincreased insulin sensitivity in the treatment groups. This aligns\nwith the findings of Lee et al., 27  who\nreported the therapeutic effect of TFN in mitigating insulin resistance\nand enhancing insulin tolerance in a model of insulin resistance induced\nby free fatty acids. Consistent with this work, our study demonstrated\nthat TEE treatment reduced insulin resistance and improved insulin\nsensitivity in CdCl 2 -induced metabolic impairments. The\nPTT is an indirect method for quantifying gluconeogenesis, designed\nto assess the conversion rate of pyruvate to glucose. It serves as\na gold standard assay for estimating glucose production. Animals fasted\nfor 6–8 h before receiving intraperitoneal pyruvate administration,\nand the AUC is calculated to determine glucose production from pyruvate.\nExcessive conversion of pyruvate to glucose can contribute to glucose\nintolerance. Treatment with TEE in our study exhibited antihyperglycemic\neffects by regulating blood glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity,\nconsistent with previous research. It has been reported that an extract\nenriched with taxifolin from  Hydnocarpus alpina  produced robust glycemic control and increased insulin secretion\nthrough a signaling pathway dependent on K + -ATP channels. 21\n\nCdCl 2  administration increased\nthe levels of α-amylase\nand α-glucosidase in the treatment group, resulting in elevated\npostprandial hyperglycemia. Both enzymes catalyze the digestion of\ncarbohydrates by cleaving α1-4 glyosidic linkages, leading to\nincreased levels of monosaccharides. 28  In\nthe present study, treatment with TEE and TFN decreased the levels\nof α-amylase and α-glucosidase in the serum, resulting\nin controlled postprandial sugar levels, which supports the previously\nreported antidiabetic effects of TFN. Su et al. 29  documented the inhibitory effect of TFN on these enzymes\nin both  in vitro  and  in vivo  experimental\nstudies. Similar to previous findings, TFN treatment in our study\nnormalized blood glucose levels, hexokinase activity, and insulin\nsecretion. 21  In the present study, CdCl 2  decreased the levels of phosphofructokinases. However, treatment\nwith TEE normalized the levels of phosphofructokinases, similar to\nthe findings of Pérez Gutiérrez, 30  who reported that TEE treatment increased the decreased\nlevels of phosphofructokinases in a diabetes model. Like previous\nfindings, TFN treatment mitigated the Cd-induced increase in G6P levels\nmarkedly. 21  Taxifolin’s robust antioxidant\nand anti-inflammatory potential has been established in the literature. 31 − 33  Similarly, in the current experimental design, TFN reduced oxidative\nstress induced by CdCl 2  through the modulation of first-line\nantioxidant enzymes and decreased inflammation by modulating key inflammatory\ncytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. 34 , 35  CdCl 2  is\nan obesogenic factor, as its administration led to increased levels\nof fatty acids, cholesterol, TGs, and FFAs, consistent with the literature. 36  However, treatment with TEE mitigated hyperlipidemia\nby modulating hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and other multiple lipid-lowering\npathways. 37  Cd produced hepatotoxicity\nin the current study’s treatment groups, as evidenced by elevated\nlevels of AST and ALT due to Cd 2 +  binding with\nsulfhydryl groups in mitochondria, leading to oxidative stress, mitochondrial\ndysfunction, and ischemia to hepatocytes. Cd also induced the activation\nof Kupffer cells and mediated inflammatory responses through the activation\nof inflammatory cytokines. TEE exhibited a hepatoprotective effect\nand decreased the levels of ALT and AST to within the normal physiological\nrange. Cd also induced nephrotoxicity in the treatment group, leading\nto elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, similar\nto previous studies reporting the nephrotoxic effects of this metal. 38 , 39  TEE, due to its nephron-protective effect, modulated the levels\nof blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. 40  Gene expression analysis of critical genes linked to glucose metabolism,\ninsulin tolerance, and sensitivity was also conducted. CdCl 2  administration downregulated the expression of IGF-1, a crucial\nfactor regulating insulin release. TEE treatment regulated glycometabolism,\nmitochondrial function, and IGF-1 expression, similar to previous\nreports. 41  CdCl 2  treatment downregulated\nthe expression of GLUT2 in adipocytes, impairing carbohydrate metabolism\nand glucose tolerance, consistent with previous findings. 42  However, TFN upregulated the mRNA expression\nof these key genes that regulate glucose and insulin homeostasis.\nmRNA expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was upregulated in\nthe CdCl 2  group, resulting in oxidative stress, as reported\nin recent work. 43  However, TEE treatment\nmitigated the expression of LDH. CdCl 2  treatment upregulated\nthe expression of angiotensin II receptors, leading to insulin insensitivity,\nimpaired glucose transport in skeletal muscles, and abnormal pancreatic\nblood flow, which can result in the development of diabetes. TEE treatment\nnotably decreased the expression of angiotensin II receptors, acting\nas an inhibitor and showing promise in the treatment of DM. HMG-CoA\nlyase is responsible for the breakdown of lipids and proteins to generate\nglucose monomers. CdCl 2  treatment impaired the expression\nof HMG-CoA and vasopressin, resulting in an impairment of carbohydrate\nmetabolism. However, taxifolin extract treatment remarkably recovered\nthe mRNA expression of these key glucogenic genes.\n\nThe mechanism\nof action underlying the protective effects of TEE\nagainst Cd-induced metabolic disruptions involves multifaceted interactions\nat the molecular level. TEE primarily targets the disrupted pathways\nin carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. TEE mitigates Cd-induced impairments\nby modulating key signaling pathways, including the antioxidant signaling\ncascade, thus, enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.\nFurthermore, TEE exerts regulatory effects on gene expression, notably\nupregulating critical genes involved in glycometabolism such as GLUT2\nand IGF-1, which are downregulated by Cd. The extract’s antioxidant\nand anti-inflammatory potential contributes to the restoration of\nmetabolic homeostasis by counteracting Cd-induced oxidative stress\nand inflammation. TEE’s ability to normalize enzymatic activities,\nregulate lipid profiles, and protect against Cd-induced hepatotoxicity\nand nephrotoxicity further underscores its comprehensive impact on\nmitigating the adverse effects of cadmium on metabolic pathways. A\nschematic representation of the mechanism of action of TEE against\nCd-induced metabolic impairment is depicted in  Figure  13 .\n\nSchematic representation illustrates the intricate\nmechanism of\naction through which taxifolin-enriched extract (TEE) modulates the\nbiochemical pathways affected by cadmium.\n\nWhile this study provides valuable insights into\nthe protective\neffects of TEE against Cd-induced metabolic impairment using an experimental\nanimal model, it is crucial to mention the certain limitations inherent\nin this experimental approach. First, extrapolating the findings from\nanimal models to human contexts requires caution due to potential\nspecies differences in metabolic responses. Additionally, the controlled\nenvironment of animal studies may not fully capture the complexity\nof human metabolic disorders and impairments. Moreover, the study\nfocuses on a specific bioactive compound, i.e., taxifolin, that is\nenriched in taxifolin extract rather than the broader spectrum of\npotential interactions within a natural environment. Addressing these\nlimitations through a discussion of potential implications emphasizes\nthe need for cautious interpretation and encourages future studies,\npotentially involving human clinical trials, to validate the observed\neffects in a more translational context. This discussion contributes\nto a more comprehensive evaluation of the study, providing a balanced\nunderstanding of its significance and potential applications.\n\nThe findings of this study, highlighting the protective effects\nof TEE against Cd-induced metabolic disruptions and impairments, have\nsignificant implications for human health and the broader population.\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of Cd exposure through soil, dietary intake,\nand sources such as cigarette smoke, our study underscores the potential\nrelevance of TEE as a therapeutic intervention for individuals exposed\nto Cd contamination. Considering the established links between Cd\nand metabolic disorders, the study’s outcomes suggest that\nTEE may offer a promising avenue for mitigating the adverse health\neffects associated with Cd exposure. Further studies of TEE’s\nefficacy in human clinical studies could contribute to the development\nof preventive strategies and interventions for populations at risk.\nThe study’s comprehensive insights into the molecular mechanisms\ninvolved in TEE’s protective effects also lay the groundwork\nfor future research aimed at understanding and addressing the broader\nimplications of Cd-induced metabolic impairments on public health.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOur comprehensive study provides valuable\ninsights into the deleterious\neffects of Cd on various metabolic pathways, with a particular focus\non carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Cd, a pervasive environmental\npollutant, has been shown to induce a cascade of metabolic disturbances,\nultimately resulting in insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance,\nand disruptions in lipid profiles. These findings underscore the pressing\nneed to understand the intricate interplay between environmental toxins\nand metabolic health, especially in the context of the alarming global\nrise in the number of DM cases. Cd exposure, which can occur through\ndietary sources, pesticides, and even cigarette smoke, poses a substantial\nrisk to metabolic well-being. Our study elucidates how CdCl 2  induces not only carbohydrate metabolism dysfunction but also oxidative\nstress and inflammation, which further exacerbate the metabolic disruptions.\nThese findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of Cd’s impact\non health and underscore the urgency of addressing environmental pollutants\nas contributors to the DM epidemic. On a promising note, our research\nhighlights the therapeutic potential of TEE from  P.\nroxburghii . TFN emerged as a compelling candidate\nfor mitigating the detrimental effects of Cd exposure. It effectively\nameliorates CdCl 2 -induced insulin resistance, improves\nglucose tolerance, and modulates lipid profiles. Importantly, TFN\nalso demonstrates antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, counteracting\noxidative stress and inflammation induced by Cd. As we look to the\nfuture, our study opens up exciting avenues for further investigation.\nLong-term studies will be essential to assessing the sustained benefits\nof TFN treatment, and clinical trials may pave the way for novel interventions\nin populations exposed to Cd and similar environmental toxins. Additionally,\nfuture research should delve into the intricate molecular pathways\nthrough which TFN exerts its protective effects. This deeper understanding\nmay lead to the development of targeted strategies for diabetes prevention\nand management, offering hope for individuals at risk due to environmental\npollutant exposure. In summary, our study underscores the critical\nneed to address the impact of environmental pollutants such as Cd\non metabolic health. It also highlights taxifolin’s potential\nas a natural therapeutic agent to mitigate the health risks associated\nwith Cd exposure, ultimately contributing to the global effort to\ncombat DM and its associated complications. Future research is necessary\nto delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms and optimize the dosage\nand duration of taxifolin-enriched extract treatment for the most\neffective therapeutic outcomes. The findings of this study shed light\non potential interventions to counteract metabolic disruptions caused\nby environmental pollutants like cadmium.",
