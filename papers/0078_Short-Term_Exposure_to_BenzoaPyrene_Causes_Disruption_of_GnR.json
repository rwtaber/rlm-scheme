      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "The hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is predominantly regulated by gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that act with a pulsatile mechanism and stimulate the secretion and synthesis of the two pituitary gonadotrophins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates sex steroids secretion (e.g., estrogen and testosterone) that regulate gonadal development [ 1 ]. Several genetic and environmental factors have been described to affect, at many levels, the reproductive functions of vertebrates. Among the factors though to affect reproduction are the exposure to certain chemicals, foods, social environment or stress [ 2 , 3 ].\n\nZebrafish represent a gold standard method to analyze the costs of environmental injury to reproduction since the endocrine axis that sustain sexual maturation and the surrounding genetic programs are well conserved in teleosts [ 1 ]. In teleost species, such as medaka and zebrafish, GnRH3 is detected in terminal nerve, hypothalamus and POA, recapitulating the function of the mammalian GNRH1, probably missed during evolution [ 4 ]. It has been shown that environmental toxic compounds, named endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), influence endocrine functions by interfering with synthesis, secretion, transport and metabolism of hormones [ 5 ]. In animal models, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), well known class of EDCs, have been reported to interfere with reproductive functions by altering hormone balance and production [ 6 ]. PAHs are the most ubiquitous pollutants and, among them, Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is considered a common EDC with mutagenic and carcinogenic effects [ 7 , 8 ]. Sources EDCs can be very different, since they are introduced into the environment via natural emission (e.g., volcanic eruption) or human activities (e.g., vehicle emission, oil shipping, and refineries); most of them are derived from the incomplete combustion of tobacco and fossil fuels [ 9 ]. Despite the efforts to reduce emissions, PAHs concentrations remain above the allowed upper limits in many countries, thus pressing the establishment of their potential toxic effects on human health [ 10 , 11 ]. Different hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of PAHs, considering uptake modality, age, duration of exposure, latency of action and dosage. It has been shown that CYP450 activates PAHs into metabolites that are highly reactive with the DNA and, in particular, the ultimate mutagenic product of BaP (BPDE) can generate guanine adducts or can be dehydrogenated by aldo-keto reductase (AKR) to form BaP- catechol that enters in a redox cycle resulting in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production [ 12 , 13 ]. Interestingly, besides oxidative DNA damage, BaP can influence DNA methylation and, depending on its concentrations and the cell type, it causes hypomethylation or hypermethylation of genes involved in carcinogenesis [ 14 ].\n\nIn mouse models, the exposure to BaP results in reproductive dysfunction, such as reduced production of spermatozoa, lower serum testosterone levels and impairment of oocyte meiotic progression resulting in a low fertilization rate [ 8 , 15 , 16 ]. In addition, exposure of BaP causes reproductive damages to aquatic organisms, affecting sexual differentiation and hatching time in medaka fish and impacting ovarian development by disrupting oocytes in  Chlamys farreri  [ 17 , 18 ]. In zebrafish, BaP impacts on ovarian development which results in a reduced fertility in female adult fish. Indeed, in adult ovary of female fish, both 17betaestradiol and testosterone levels were reduced, together with impaired hatching and fertilization rate [ 19 ]. Interestingly, studies focusing on the impact of BaP on the GnRH3 neurons funtion are lacking, but it was recently described that Bisphenol F, an EDC analogue of bisphenol A, affects GnRH3 neurons in zebrafish by acting through an estrogenic pathway [ 20 ]. Gao et al., showed that the embryonic exposure of BaP caused a diminished expression of all of these HPG markers in zebrafish adults [ 19 ]. The persisting effects of embryonic exposure of BaP on both juvenile gonadal development and adult reproductive capacity suggest the existence of early deregulation of GnRH3 system. To explore this possibility, in our work we took advantage of the zebrafish transgenic line  tg ( GnRH3 :EGFP) [ 1 , 21 ] to study the effects of short-term embryonic exposure to BaP on GnRH3 neurons development."

      "text": "Zebrafish embryos treated since 2.5 up to 72 hpf with 5 nM or 50 nM of BaP did not show any morphological alterations ( Figure 1 A–F), nor significant differences in the survival rates when compared to the embryos treated with the control vehicle (1.2% DMSO) ( Figure 1 G).\n\nWe then concentrated on GnRH3 neuron development using the  tg (GnRH3:EGFP) line [ 21 ]. In normal conditions, GnRH3 neurons start to differentiate and proliferate at the level of the olfactory placode (OP) at 24–30 hpf, projecting their axons dorsoventrally towards the pallium and converging at the midline to form the anterior commissure (AC). Around 40–48 hpf, new fibers elongate along the pre-optic area (POA) to innervate the retina (Re) and extend dorsocaudally their axons to reach the hypothalamus (Hy) at 72 hpf. The analysis of GnRH3 architecture was performed in control and BaP-treated embryos at 33, 48 and 72 hpf, spanning the entire GnRH3 neuron development. At 33 hpf, the GFP signal at the level of olphactory bulbs (OBs) and retina (Re) was dramatically decreased in both 5- and 50 nM-treated embryos when compared with the DMSO controls ( Figure 2 B–D). At 48 hpf, we observed a dose-dependent reduction of GFP on OBs, AC, POA, Re, and Hy innervation in treated embryos ( Figure 2 F–H): the GnRH3 positive signal was diminished in AC and Re after exposure to 5 nM BaP and almost completely absent after 50 nM BaP treatment ( Figure 2 M). Nonetheless, at 72 hpf the GnRH3 neuronal architecture appeared completely compromised after the exposure of both 5 and 50 nM BaP ( Figure 2 J–L).\n\nThe dose-dependent reduction of GnRH3-GFP cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis in control and treated embryos at 48 hpf ( Figure 3 A–D).\n\nGiven the mechanism of toxicity of BaP reported in zebrafish and other species [ 18 , 22 ], we evaluated by qPCR the expression of genes involved in antioxidant activity ( sod1 ,  sod2 ,  cat1 ), oxidative DNA damage ( ogg1 ) and apoptosis ( casp3a  and  casp3b ), in control and treated embryos at 48 hpf. Embryos exposed to 5 nM BaP exhibited an increased expression of  sod1  and  casp3b  ( Figure 4 A,F), whereas the expression levels of the antioxidants  sod1 ,  sod2  and  cat1  ( Figure 4 A–C) and of the apoptotic markers  casp3a  and  casp3b  ( Figure 4 E,F) were significantly upregulated in 50 nM BaP-treated embryos. No changes in the expression of  ogg1  were observed in all conditions ( Figure 4 D).\n\nAt this point, to test whether BaP neurotoxicity was associated with GnRH3 defects we performed a TUNEL assay on embryos at 48 hpf. Compared to the few apoptotic cells detectable at the level of OBs and AC of DMSO-controls ( Figure 5 B), a strong apoptotic signal was visible in the olphactory and optic regions in 5 nM BaP treated embryos ( Figure 5 C). Consistently with the GnRH3 phenotype and qPCR results, the embryos treated with 50 nM BaP showed a dramatic increment of cell death in brain, especially in olphactory, preoptic area and hypothalamus ( Figure 5 D).\n\nFinally, we evaluated the expression of the main transcripts belonging the HPG-axis in larvae at 120 hpf ( Figure 6 ). Consistently with the reduced fluorescent signals observed in  tg ( GnRH3 :EGFP) embryos after BaP exposure, the expression of  gnrh3  and of its pituitary receptor  gnrhr3  were significant downregulated after both 5 and 50 nM BaP at larval stage ( Figure 6 A,B). However, despite the impairment of GnRH3 signal, the levels of  fshb  and  lhb  of BaP-treated larvae appeared comparable to the controls ( Figure 6 C,D). Regarding the expression of the other transcripts that sustain gonadal development,  vtg1  was upregulated in a BaP dose-dependent manner whereas  esr1  was significantly lower in 50 nM BaP larvae when compared with 1.2% DMSO controls ( Figure 6 E,G). Lastly,  vtg2  and  esr2  appeared preserved in all groups ( Figure 6 F,H)."

      "text": "In the present work, we report for the first time the developmental consequences of BaP exposure on GnRH3 architecture using zebrafish embryos as a model system. The analysis of GnRH3 neuronal architecture at different time-points, covering the entire GnRH3 development, revealed a dose-dependent effect of BaP. The severity of GnRH3 phenotypes, ranging from the reduced number GnRH3 fibers at the level of olfactory bulbs and retina to a severe reduction or complete absence of signals in almost all GnRH3 sites. The dose-dependent reduction of GnRH3-GFP cells in BaP-treated embryos was also confirmed by FACS analysis. The lack of gross morphological alterations (including brain necrosis) in treated embryos, confirmed that the GnRH3 phenotypes were not caused by overall embryonic toxicity of BaP.\n\nSeveral studies described the mechanism of action of BaP based on their uptake, age and exposure window, latency, and dosage [ 5 , 22 ]. The oral exposure to BaP resulted in developmental, immunological, and reproductive effects such as decreased fertility and neurobehavioral alterations in animal models [ 8 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ]. Reproductive defects included the impairment of ovary weight, sperm counts and follicles numbers [ 8 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 25 , 27 ]. Moreover, epidemiological studies in humans reported adverse birth outcomes, including reduced birth and postnatal body weight and lower head circumference, other developmental, neurobehavioral effects that are generally analogous to those observed in animals, providing supportive evidence for hazards associated with BaP exposure [ 10 , 23 , 28 , 29 , 30 ]. However, studies on the interfering effects of BaP on GnRH neuron development are lacking.\n\nTo test whether BaP affects GnRH3 development, we investigated the expression of several markers of antioxidant response and apoptosis. Confirming those reported by others [ 31 ], BaP caused neurotoxicity as revealed by the increased expression of antioxidant and apoptotic genes. Coherently, embryos treated with 5 or 50 nM BaP exhibited increased cell death in several brain areas, as olphactory placode, retina, and hypothalamus. Finally, accordingly to GnRH3 network impaiment observed in reporter embryos, BaP esposure was associated with a significant dose-depentent downregulation of  gnrh3  and  gnrhr3  transcripts in treated larvae at 120 hpf. Interestingly, this was not accompanied by a downregulation of gonadotrophins, whose expression is directly dependent by GnRH3-GnRH3R signal. These results might be explained by the relative low expression levels of both  fshb  and  lhb , which start to be expressed at larval stages ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). It is possible that sensitivity of qPCR is not enough to detect expression changes in these transcripts and that might be evident in later stages. Infact, differences in HPG transcripts levels were previously described in zebrafish adult females exposed to BaP during embryonic window [ 19 ]. Brain and ovary samples exhibited, a dose-dependent downregulation of all of these hormones, and as a consequence, a reduced fertility and fecundity rates [ 19 ].\n\nThe overall data suggest that BaP increased the oxidative stress in GnRH3 neurons that is only partially counteracted by the increment of antioxidants expression. The persistence of stress-environment inevitably caused the activation of apoptotic pathway and neuronal death. Although the carcinogenic effects of BaP received more attention than neurotoxicity, the toxic effects of BaP on nervous system development has been previously described in humans and animal models [ 23 , 24 , 32 ]. Environmental exposure to BaP correlated with impaired memory and learning ability in humans [ 23 , 28 ]. Studies in rodents also identified the potential point of departure (POD) values for cancer and neurotoxicity endpoints. The POD carcinogenic value in rodents was 0.55 mg BaP/kg-bw-day whereas the POD for neurotoxicity value was markedly lower, 0.025 mg BaP/kg-bw-day [ 23 ]. Taking into consideration that neuronal development is a complex process consisting of multiple events that occur during early life it seems reasonable that neurotoxicity is more susceptible to BaP exposure than carcinogenesis. Chepelev and colleagues also hypothesized a preliminary mechanism of action to explain BaP-induced neurotoxicity: (i) BaP binding to the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR); (ii) AHR-dependent modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate-glutamate receptor (NMDAR); (iii) NMDAR-mediated neuronal cell death and (iv) compromised learning and memory. However, it is also possible that tissue oxidative damage mediated by BaP may finally lead to either neurotoxicity or carcinogenesis [ 23 , 24 ]. Other studies have also identified epigenetic modification as a BaP-dependent toxic effect. Acute exposure of BaP in Tergillaca granosa is associated with increased antioxidant activity and lipid peroxidation levels that negatively correlates with global methylation [ 22 ]. In this context, the oxidative-stress conditions seem to inhibit DNA methylation with the aim of increasing antioxidant capacity against BaP toxicity [ 22 ]. Similarly, BaP administration to medaka adults induced changes in germ-cell DNA methylation that caused neurotoxicity and bone deformities in unexposed offspring [ 23 ]. In zebrafish, BaP exposure significantly reduced egg production and offspring survival, and induced global hypomethylation [ 24 ]. Interestingly, the methylation levels of GnRH3 were elevated in the adult brain, which might be caused by up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3a [ 17 ]. Since DNA methylation is established from 4.3 to 6 hpf and that organogenesis is completed at 96 hpf, it reasonable that DNA methylation patterns would be easily changed by BaP [ 24 ].\n\nIn our study, GnRH3 development was affected after embryonic exposure to BaP for a short period, likely caused by neurotoxicity. However, defects in DNA methylation profiles should be considered as an additional or intermediate factor for BaP toxicity."

Given the toxicity of this compound, we evaluated the expression of genes involved in antioxidant activity, oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis and we found an upregulation of these pathways. Consequently, we performed a TUNEL assay and we confirmed an increment of cell death in brain of embryos treated with BaP. In conclusion our data reveal that short-term exposure of zebrafish embryos to BaP affects GnRH3 development likely through a neurotoxic mechanism.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is predominantly regulated by gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons that act with a pulsatile mechanism and stimulate the secretion and synthesis of the two pituitary gonadotrophins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates sex steroids secretion (e.g., estrogen and testosterone) that regulate gonadal development [ 1 ]. Several genetic and environmental factors have been described to affect, at many levels, the reproductive functions of vertebrates. Among the factors though to affect reproduction are the exposure to certain chemicals, foods, social environment or stress [ 2 , 3 ].\n\nZebrafish represent a gold standard method to analyze the costs of environmental injury to reproduction since the endocrine axis that sustain sexual maturation and the surrounding genetic programs are well conserved in teleosts [ 1 ]. In teleost species, such as medaka and zebrafish, GnRH3 is detected in terminal nerve, hypothalamus and POA, recapitulating the function of the mammalian GNRH1, probably missed during evolution [ 4 ]. It has been shown that environmental toxic compounds, named endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), influence endocrine functions by interfering with synthesis, secretion, transport and metabolism of hormones [ 5 ]. In animal models, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), well known class of EDCs, have been reported to interfere with reproductive functions by altering hormone balance and production [ 6 ]. PAHs are the most ubiquitous pollutants and, among them, Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is considered a common EDC with mutagenic and carcinogenic effects [ 7 , 8 ]. Sources EDCs can be very different, since they are introduced into the environment via natural emission (e.g., volcanic eruption) or human activities (e.g., vehicle emission, oil shipping, and refineries); most of them are derived from the incomplete combustion of tobacco and fossil fuels [ 9 ]. Despite the efforts to reduce emissions, PAHs concentrations remain above the allowed upper limits in many countries, thus pressing the establishment of their potential toxic effects on human health [ 10 , 11 ]. Different hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of PAHs, considering uptake modality, age, duration of exposure, latency of action and dosage. It has been shown that CYP450 activates PAHs into metabolites that are highly reactive with the DNA and, in particular, the ultimate mutagenic product of BaP (BPDE) can generate guanine adducts or can be dehydrogenated by aldo-keto reductase (AKR) to form BaP- catechol that enters in a redox cycle resulting in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production [ 12 , 13 ]. Interestingly, besides oxidative DNA damage, BaP can influence DNA methylation and, depending on its concentrations and the cell type, it causes hypomethylation or hypermethylation of genes involved in carcinogenesis [ 14 ].\n\nIn mouse models, the exposure to BaP results in reproductive dysfunction, such as reduced production of spermatozoa, lower serum testosterone levels and impairment of oocyte meiotic progression resulting in a low fertilization rate [ 8 , 15 , 16 ]. In addition, exposure of BaP causes reproductive damages to aquatic organisms, affecting sexual differentiation and hatching time in medaka fish and impacting ovarian development by disrupting oocytes in  Chlamys farreri  [ 17 , 18 ]. In zebrafish, BaP impacts on ovarian development which results in a reduced fertility in female adult fish. Indeed, in adult ovary of female fish, both 17betaestradiol and testosterone levels were reduced, together with impaired hatching and fertilization rate [ 19 ]. Interestingly, studies focusing on the impact of BaP on the GnRH3 neurons funtion are lacking, but it was recently described that Bisphenol F, an EDC analogue of bisphenol A, affects GnRH3 neurons in zebrafish by acting through an estrogenic pathway [ 20 ]. Gao et al., showed that the embryonic exposure of BaP caused a diminished expression of all of these HPG markers in zebrafish adults [ 19 ]. The persisting effects of embryonic exposure of BaP on both juvenile gonadal development and adult reproductive capacity suggest the existence of early deregulation of GnRH3 system. To explore this possibility, in our work we took advantage of the zebrafish transgenic line  tg ( GnRH3 :EGFP) [ 1 , 21 ] to study the effects of short-term embryonic exposure to BaP on GnRH3 neurons development.\n\n## 2. Results\n\nZebrafish embryos treated since 2.5 up to 72 hpf with 5 nM or 50 nM of BaP did not show any morphological alterations ( Figure 1 A–F), nor significant differences in the survival rates when compared to the embryos treated with the control vehicle (1.2% DMSO) ( Figure 1 G).\n\nWe then concentrated on GnRH3 neuron development using the  tg (GnRH3:EGFP) line [ 21 ]. In normal conditions, GnRH3 neurons start to differentiate and proliferate at the level of the olfactory placode (OP) at 24–30 hpf, projecting their axons dorsoventrally towards the pallium and converging at the midline to form the anterior commissure (AC). Around 40–48 hpf, new fibers elongate along the pre-optic area (POA) to innervate the retina (Re) and extend dorsocaudally their axons to reach the hypothalamus (Hy) at 72 hpf. The analysis of GnRH3 architecture was performed in control and BaP-treated embryos at 33, 48 and 72 hpf, spanning the entire GnRH3 neuron development. At 33 hpf, the GFP signal at the level of olphactory bulbs (OBs) and retina (Re) was dramatically decreased in both 5- and 50 nM-treated embryos when compared with the DMSO controls ( Figure 2 B–D). At 48 hpf, we observed a dose-dependent reduction of GFP on OBs, AC, POA, Re, and Hy innervation in treated embryos ( Figure 2 F–H): the GnRH3 positive signal was diminished in AC and Re after exposure to 5 nM BaP and almost completely absent after 50 nM BaP treatment ( Figure 2 M). Nonetheless, at 72 hpf the GnRH3 neuronal architecture appeared completely compromised after the exposure of both 5 and 50 nM BaP ( Figure 2 J–L).\n\nThe dose-dependent reduction of GnRH3-GFP cells were also confirmed by flow cytometry analysis in control and treated embryos at 48 hpf ( Figure 3 A–D).\n\nGiven the mechanism of toxicity of BaP reported in zebrafish and other species [ 18 , 22 ], we evaluated by qPCR the expression of genes involved in antioxidant activity ( sod1 ,  sod2 ,  cat1 ), oxidative DNA damage ( ogg1 ) and apoptosis ( casp3a  and  casp3b ), in control and treated embryos at 48 hpf. Embryos exposed to 5 nM BaP exhibited an increased expression of  sod1  and  casp3b  ( Figure 4 A,F), whereas the expression levels of the antioxidants  sod1 ,  sod2  and  cat1  ( Figure 4 A–C) and of the apoptotic markers  casp3a  and  casp3b  ( Figure 4 E,F) were significantly upregulated in 50 nM BaP-treated embryos. No changes in the expression of  ogg1  were observed in all conditions ( Figure 4 D).\n\nAt this point, to test whether BaP neurotoxicity was associated with GnRH3 defects we performed a TUNEL assay on embryos at 48 hpf. Compared to the few apoptotic cells detectable at the level of OBs and AC of DMSO-controls ( Figure 5 B), a strong apoptotic signal was visible in the olphactory and optic regions in 5 nM BaP treated embryos ( Figure 5 C). Consistently with the GnRH3 phenotype and qPCR results, the embryos treated with 50 nM BaP showed a dramatic increment of cell death in brain, especially in olphactory, preoptic area and hypothalamus ( Figure 5 D).\n\nFinally, we evaluated the expression of the main transcripts belonging the HPG-axis in larvae at 120 hpf ( Figure 6 ). Consistently with the reduced fluorescent signals observed in  tg ( GnRH3 :EGFP) embryos after BaP exposure, the expression of  gnrh3  and of its pituitary receptor  gnrhr3  were significant downregulated after both 5 and 50 nM BaP at larval stage ( Figure 6 A,B). However, despite the impairment of GnRH3 signal, the levels of  fshb  and  lhb  of BaP-treated larvae appeared comparable to the controls ( Figure 6 C,D). Regarding the expression of the other transcripts that sustain gonadal development,  vtg1  was upregulated in a BaP dose-dependent manner whereas  esr1  was significantly lower in 50 nM BaP larvae when compared with 1.2% DMSO controls ( Figure 6 E,G). Lastly,  vtg2  and  esr2  appeared preserved in all groups ( Figure 6 F,H).\n\n## 3. Discussion\n\nIn the present work, we report for the first time the developmental consequences of BaP exposure on GnRH3 architecture using zebrafish embryos as a model system. The analysis of GnRH3 neuronal architecture at different time-points, covering the entire GnRH3 development, revealed a dose-dependent effect of BaP. The severity of GnRH3 phenotypes, ranging from the reduced number GnRH3 fibers at the level of olfactory bulbs and retina to a severe reduction or complete absence of signals in almost all GnRH3 sites. The dose-dependent reduction of GnRH3-GFP cells in BaP-treated embryos was also confirmed by FACS analysis. The lack of gross morphological alterations (including brain necrosis) in treated embryos, confirmed that the GnRH3 phenotypes were not caused by overall embryonic toxicity of BaP.\n\nSeveral studies described the mechanism of action of BaP based on their uptake, age and exposure window, latency, and dosage [ 5 , 22 ]. The oral exposure to BaP resulted in developmental, immunological, and reproductive effects such as decreased fertility and neurobehavioral alterations in animal models [ 8 , 17 , 19 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ]. Reproductive defects included the impairment of ovary weight, sperm counts and follicles numbers [ 8 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 19 , 25 , 27 ]. Moreover, epidemiological studies in humans reported adverse birth outcomes, including reduced birth and postnatal body weight and lower head circumference, other developmental, neurobehavioral effects that are generally analogous to those observed in animals, providing supportive evidence for hazards associated with BaP exposure [ 10 , 23 , 28 , 29 , 30 ]. However, studies on the interfering effects of BaP on GnRH neuron development are lacking.\n\nTo test whether BaP affects GnRH3 development, we investigated the expression of several markers of antioxidant response and apoptosis. Confirming those reported by others [ 31 ], BaP caused neurotoxicity as revealed by the increased expression of antioxidant and apoptotic genes. Coherently, embryos treated with 5 or 50 nM BaP exhibited increased cell death in several brain areas, as olphactory placode, retina, and hypothalamus. Finally, accordingly to GnRH3 network impaiment observed in reporter embryos, BaP esposure was associated with a significant dose-depentent downregulation of  gnrh3  and  gnrhr3  transcripts in treated larvae at 120 hpf. Interestingly, this was not accompanied by a downregulation of gonadotrophins, whose expression is directly dependent by GnRH3-GnRH3R signal. These results might be explained by the relative low expression levels of both  fshb  and  lhb , which start to be expressed at larval stages ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). It is possible that sensitivity of qPCR is not enough to detect expression changes in these transcripts and that might be evident in later stages. Infact, differences in HPG transcripts levels were previously described in zebrafish adult females exposed to BaP during embryonic window [ 19 ]. Brain and ovary samples exhibited, a dose-dependent downregulation of all of these hormones, and as a consequence, a reduced fertility and fecundity rates [ 19 ].\n\nThe overall data suggest that BaP increased the oxidative stress in GnRH3 neurons that is only partially counteracted by the increment of antioxidants expression. The persistence of stress-environment inevitably caused the activation of apoptotic pathway and neuronal death. Although the carcinogenic effects of BaP received more attention than neurotoxicity, the toxic effects of BaP on nervous system development has been previously described in humans and animal models [ 23 , 24 , 32 ]. Environmental exposure to BaP correlated with impaired memory and learning ability in humans [ 23 , 28 ]. Studies in rodents also identified the potential point of departure (POD) values for cancer and neurotoxicity endpoints. The POD carcinogenic value in rodents was 0.55 mg BaP/kg-bw-day whereas the POD for neurotoxicity value was markedly lower, 0.025 mg BaP/kg-bw-day [ 23 ]. Taking into consideration that neuronal development is a complex process consisting of multiple events that occur during early life it seems reasonable that neurotoxicity is more susceptible to BaP exposure than carcinogenesis. Chepelev and colleagues also hypothesized a preliminary mechanism of action to explain BaP-induced neurotoxicity: (i) BaP binding to the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR); (ii) AHR-dependent modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate-glutamate receptor (NMDAR); (iii) NMDAR-mediated neuronal cell death and (iv) compromised learning and memory. However, it is also possible that tissue oxidative damage mediated by BaP may finally lead to either neurotoxicity or carcinogenesis [ 23 , 24 ]. Other studies have also identified epigenetic modification as a BaP-dependent toxic effect. Acute exposure of BaP in Tergillaca granosa is associated with increased antioxidant activity and lipid peroxidation levels that negatively correlates with global methylation [ 22 ]. In this context, the oxidative-stress conditions seem to inhibit DNA methylation with the aim of increasing antioxidant capacity against BaP toxicity [ 22 ]. Similarly, BaP administration to medaka adults induced changes in germ-cell DNA methylation that caused neurotoxicity and bone deformities in unexposed offspring [ 23 ]. In zebrafish, BaP exposure significantly reduced egg production and offspring survival, and induced global hypomethylation [ 24 ]. Interestingly, the methylation levels of GnRH3 were elevated in the adult brain, which might be caused by up-regulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3a [ 17 ]. Since DNA methylation is established from 4.3 to 6 hpf and that organogenesis is completed at 96 hpf, it reasonable that DNA methylation patterns would be easily changed by BaP [ 24 ].\n\nIn our study, GnRH3 development was affected after embryonic exposure to BaP for a short period, likely caused by neurotoxicity. However, defects in DNA methylation profiles should be considered as an additional or intermediate factor for BaP toxicity.\n\n## 4.
