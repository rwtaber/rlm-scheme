The unique physicochemical properties of these materials lead to novel toxicological effects, primarily driven by the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation, establishing nanotoxicology as a critical public health field. This scoping review synthesizes the current evidence from preclinical models to provide an overview of the mechanisms and end-organ toxicities associated with exposure to metal-containing nanoparticles.MethodsA scoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The PubMed database was searched on August 11, 2024, using a detailed search string focused on nanoparticle inhalation, human toxicity, and metals. Inclusion criteria specified English-language articles reporting on in vivo or in vitro human tissue studies, while studies that were animal-only, reviews, or non-toxicological modeling were excluded.ResultsThe initial search yielded 946 records; ultimately, 136 articles were analyzed based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A thematic analysis of the included studies reveals that research is heavily concentrated on the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide being the most frequently investigated nanoparticles. Across all organ systems, the principal mechanisms of toxicity were consistently identified as the generation of reactive oxygen species and the initiation of inflammatory cascades. Key organ-specific findings include disruption of the respiratory epithelial barrier, nanoparticle translocation to the cardiovascular and nervous systems, associated mitochondrial damage and protein aggregation, and dose-dependent genotoxicity, including DNA strand breaks and micronuclei formation.DiscussionThe toxicity of metal-containing nanoparticles is highly dependent on their specific physicochemical characteristics, including size, chemical composition, and agglomeration state. While in vitro models have been invaluable for elucidating these mechanistic pathways, significant limitations remain, including a lack of standardization and challenges in translating findings to clinical outcomes in humans. Future research should focus on validating advanced, reproducible models, investigating complex mixed exposures, and identifying sensitive biomarkers to better inform risk assessment and protect public health.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.",

      "text": "Nanotechnology involves the engineering and manipulation of materials having at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers [1]. Although the scientific field of nanotechnology was formally defined in the 1980s, human exposure to naturally occurring nanoparticles (NPs) has been a constant feature of the environment [2]. In recent decades, potential human exposure to NPs is expected to rise, driven by both unintentional anthropogenic sources, such as industrial byproducts, and the increasing use of intentionally engineered nanomaterials [3, 4]. The novel physicochemical behaviors and high surface-area-to-volume ratios inherent to nanomaterials result in unique toxicological properties that are not predictable by classical pharmacokinetic and dynamic models [5]. Consequently, nanotoxicology has emerged as a sub-discipline of particle toxicology dedicated to assessing these hazards and establishing clinical principles for managing both occupational and public exposure [3, 5]. A central focus of nanotoxicology is assessing the risks from environmental and occupational sources, which represent a significant and growing public health concern [6]. Human exposure occurs through a hierarchy of routes, with the greatest potential in occupational settings where raw nanomaterials are handled, followed by consumer exposure through products like cosmetics and sprays, and finally via the general environment [7]. These particles enter the body through multiple routes, including inhalation of airborne pollutants like welding fumes and ingestion of contaminated drinking water, leading to systemic effects [8, 9]. A consensus is emerging from in vitro research that the primary mechanisms of toxicity are the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation [10]. For example, studies on human lung cells have shown that exposure to metal-containing NP mixtures from welding fumes leads to decreased cell viability, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a robust inflammatory response mediated by cytokines like IL-8 [11]. This mechanistic understanding is crucial, as the specific composition of the NPs can significantly alter the toxicological outcome, yet translating these cellular findings into clear human health risks remains a key challenge for both clinical guidance and regulatory frameworks [8]. The evolving nature of this field is reflected in a dynamic regulatory landscape, as bodies like the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) work to develop frameworks that address the unique challenges posed by nanomaterials. While numerous industrial reviews have characterized the extent of occupational exposures [4, 7], translating this hazard identification data into clinically relevant guidance requires extensive modelling [12–14]. Therefore, in vivo animal and in vitro cellular models have been essential for elucidating mechanisms of toxicity and predicting potential human health outcomes. This review examines the current scope of knowledge regarding human end-organ toxicity following exposure to metal-containing NPs. By synthesizing findings from preclinical in situ and in vitro models, we aim to provide an overview of the mechanisms and manifestations of metal-containing NP toxicity."

      "text": "To align with the exploratory aims of this investigation, this study was conducted as a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. No previous scoping review protocol for metal-containing NPs existed. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database on August 11, 2024, using a multi-string approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of the topic. The primary search queries were inhaled metallic NPs human toxicity, inhaled zinc oxide NPs human toxicity, inhal* AND nano* AND human AND toxi* AND metal*, and inhal* AND titan* AND nano* AND human toxi*. The publication years of the screened articles ranged from 2003 to 2024, spanning the most recent two decades of available literature. The inclusion criteria were English-language articles reporting on nanomaterial exposure in human tissues (e.g., pharynx, larynx, trachea, myocardium, and thoracic lymph nodes) using either in vivo or in vitro models. The exclusion criteria were non-human studies (i.e., those conducted exclusively in animal, insect, or plant models); non-original research (e.g., reviews, editorials, letters, and updates); studies focused on therapeutic drug delivery where toxicity was not a primary outcome; and purely theoretical or risk-assessment papers that lacked experimental exposure and toxicity data. While animal models remain essential to understanding nanoparticle biodistribution and metabolism, our intended objective was to map mechanistic evidence in human tissue and derived from in vitro systems. In this review, “metal-containing NPs” is used as an umbrella term encompassing elemental forms of metals, metal oxides, metalloids, and composite forms. Within the nanotoxicology literature, metallic NPs generally refer to elemental forms such as silver or gold, while metal oxide NPs describe oxidized derivatives such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide [15]. Metalloid NPs include elements with intermediate metallic character, such as arsenic [15]. Because many of the studies included here examine complex or mixed compositions, this broader terminology most accurately captures the materials under investigation and aligns with definitions used in recent nanotoxicology reviews [16, 17]. As reported in Fig. 1, the initial search yielded 946 articles. After removing 521 duplicates, 425 unique records remained for screening. These articles were independently evaluated by the authors based on predefined eligibility criteria. We acknowledge that some studies meeting the inclusion criteria were not ultimately represented in the narrative synthesis. As permitted within the PRISMA-ScR framework, scoping reviews emphasize conceptual mapping and may selectively highlight studies most relevant to the review objectives. Consistent with the iterative nature of scoping methodology, additional relevant papers identified during manuscript development were incorporated when they met the inclusion criteria and contributed meaningfully to the evidence map.

      "text": "From the 425 unique articles screened, 289 were excluded for not meeting the eligibility criteria. The primary reasons for exclusion included being non-human or ecotoxicology studies (n = 114), focusing on drug-delivery (n = 6), examining NPs that did not contain metal (n = 19), being non-original research (n = 89), not being in English (n = 8), or being exposure/dosimetry studies that lacked relevant toxicological data (n = 53). This screening process resulted in a final set of 136 articles that were included in the scoping review. A heatmap summarizing the distribution of these studies across different NPs and organ systems is presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2Heatmap illustrating the distribution of studies across different nanoparticles (NPs) and organ systems. The data reveals a significant concentration of research on zinc and titanium NPs, particularly within respiratory and immunological contexts. Studies investigating broad occupational or environmental exposures with numerous nanomaterials were excluded from this depiction Heatmap illustrating the distribution of studies across different nanoparticles (NPs) and organ systems. The data reveals a significant concentration of research on zinc and titanium NPs, particularly within respiratory and immunological contexts. Studies investigating broad occupational or environmental exposures with numerous nanomaterials were excluded from this depiction Early studies established that engineered NPs can engage the immune system to produce inflammatory responses, yet even at that time researchers recognized that surface chemistry, crystal structure, and particle size strongly influenced this behavior [18]. Experiments demonstrated that exposure to metal oxides such as titanium dioxide activated macrophages and epithelial cells, leading to release of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. This response was later refined through mechanistic work showing that inflammasome activation and IL-1β release represent a central component of the innate immune reaction [19, 20]. Upstream signaling studies demonstrated that NP exposure can induce oxidative stress mediators such as macrophage migration-inhibitory factor and amplify cytokine release through interactions with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, indicating that immune modulation occurs both before and after inflammasome activation [21, 22]. Even when overt cytotoxicity or inflammation are absent, suppression of immune signaling and impairment of host defense can still occur, highlighting a parallel mechanism of risk [23]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that metal-containing NPs can induce persistent immune modulation across multiple regulatory levels, with short exposures altering methylation and transcription of immune-related genes and corresponding human data showing long non-coding RNA shifts linked to IL-6 and cardiovascular inflammation, while copper oxide exposure produced oxidative and mitochondrial injury in lymphocytes consistent with these transcriptional effects [24–26]. Transcriptomic profiling in bronchial epithelia from asthmatic and healthy donors further revealed that copper oxide NPs elicit stronger IL-6 and IL-8 signaling and altered ciliary and metallothionein gene expression in asthmatic airways, underscoring how disease state and surface chemistry together modulate immune sensitivity [27]. Crystalline form further shapes the magnitude and nature of immune activation. Titanium dioxide commonly occurs as anatase or rutile, and these phases differ in surface energy, photocatalytic activity, and redox potential. Anatase typically exhibits stronger oxidative and inflammatory activity, whereas rutile tends to produce weaker but composition-dependent responses [18]. These distinctions were quantified through systematic variation of particle characteristics showing that IL-1β release is governed by size, shape, and crystal phase through a shared oxidative and lysosomal mechanism [28]. Later work extended this to endothelial and monocyte adhesion models, demonstrating that mixed anatase–rutile formulations differentially regulate receptor expression and inflammatory signaling [29]. Ultimately, the relationship between particle architecture and dissolution behavior has been crucial to understanding immune responses. Agglomeration state affects macrophage uptake and cytokine production, with larger aggregates of titanium dioxide provoking stronger IL-1β and IL-8 release despite identical chemical composition [30]. Moreover, poorly dissolved NPs can induce membrane disruption and cytotoxicity even when ionic release is minimal, underscoring that dissolution kinetics alone do not determine toxicity [31]. Collectively, these findings indicate that NP–immune interactions are dictated by a combination of surface reactivity, crystalline structure, aggregation, and persistence rather than by particle size or composition alone. NP interaction with the gastrointestinal barrier is a dynamic process defined less by passive diffusion and more by physicochemical transformation [30, 32, 33]. Studies of oral and intestinal epithelia show that particle size, surface charge, and agglomeration determine whether nanomaterials remain confined to mucus layers or traverse into the subepithelial compartment [32, 33]. Dissolution begins at this interface, where metal oxides such as zinc and copper release ions, while more inert materials such as titanium largely maintain particulate form [34–36]. This early dissolution alters aggregation and membrane affinity, reshaping exposure chemistry before systemic entry [30, 34, 35]. The resulting translocation is not governed by size alone but by the balance between particle stability and solubility, with loosely bound or partially dissolved species entering circulation more readily than intact aggregates [33–35]. Within this framework, epithelial toxicity involving tight junction disruption, redox imbalance, and limited inflammatory signaling reflects not a single mechanism but the composite outcome of dissolution kinetics and surface reactivity [30, 35, 37]. Once systemically distributed, these same dissolution dynamics define the hepatic response [36, 38–40]. The liver receives NPs both as intact aggregates and as dissolved metal ions, and distinguishing between these forms is central to interpreting toxicological outcomes [39, 41]. Across zinc, copper, cobalt, and lead oxides, hepatocellular injury consistently aligns with oxidative stress secondary to ionic release rather than unique nanoscale effects [36, 39, 40]. That said, while most evidence links gastrointestinal toxicity to dissolution and ionic activity, some findings indicate that particulate mechanisms can contribute independently; in a comparative study of aluminum-based nanomaterials, minimal ionic release did not prevent the induction of oxidative DNA lesions in intestinal cells, while ionic aluminum salts produced no comparable damage [42]. Intracellular dissolution, sometimes accelerated by acidic lysosomal conditions, can amplify this effect, producing a “Trojan horse” scenario in which nominally insoluble particles deliver concentrated bursts of bioavailable metal within hepatocytes [36, 39]. This intracellular release disrupts mitochondrial potential, disturbs ATP balance, and activates gluconeogenic and lipid-handling pathways that resemble early steatosis or metabolic injury [36, 39, 40]. The resulting oxidative and metabolic stress profile blurs the distinction between NP and heavy-metal toxicity, emphasizing that for many oxides, hepatotoxicity is chemically rather than structurally mediated [39–41]. Viewed together, the data converge on dissolution as the mechanistic bridge between local epithelial disruption and systemic metabolic toxicity [34–36, 39]. Particle integrity determines exposure site, but solubility determines biological consequence [30, 36]. NPs that remain stable, such as titanium dioxide, tend to accumulate with limited acute cytotoxicity [30, 32, 43], while those prone to ion release provoke oxidative and metabolic stress across tissues [34, 35, 39, 40]. The central challenge for future research lies in separating the genuinely nano-enabled behaviors, such as intracellular transport, compartmentalized dissolution, and prolonged retention, from effects explainable by classical metal toxicity [36, 38, 39]. The skin serves as both a physical barrier and a potential portal for NP interaction in occupational and consumer contexts. Early studies using keratinocyte monolayers showed that titanium dioxide NPs induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and oxidative DNA lesions, including micronucleus formation, without marked cytotoxicity or loss of proliferation [44, 45]. Subsequent work with copper oxide reported similar oxidative stress responses but with stronger reductions in cell viability, likely related to copper ion dissolution [46]. Studies of zinc oxide further refined this model by demonstrating that stress responses extend beyond ROS generation, encompassing transcriptional activation of metallothioneins, heat shock proteins, and DNA-damage–response genes in both keratinocytes and melanocytes [34]. Collectively, these findings reflect a progression from descriptive toxicity toward a mechanistic understanding centered on oxidative and stress-signaling pathways as the primary mediators of cutaneous NP responses. Three-dimensional reconstructed epidermal models show that materials cytotoxic in submerged monolayer cultures, including degraded graphene–manganese oxide composites, do not trigger significant irritation when the epidermal barrier is preserved [37]. These studies suggest that while oxidative stress is a common mechanistic endpoint across NP types, the intact stratum corneum effectively mitigates biological impact, emphasizing the importance of exposure context in dermal risk evaluation. Inhalation and deposition studies together demonstrate that metal-containing NPs can directly compromise cardiac structure and function through oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms. Autopsy findings of iron-rich NPs embedded within myocardial mitochondria revealed mitochondrial deformation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and elevated oxidative markers consistent with Fenton-type reactivity [47]. These pathological observations are reinforced by occupational data linking exposure to metal fume PM2.5 with systemic oxidative biomarkers in welders and by 3D vascularized models that replicate NP-induced endothelial permeability and vasoconstriction through NF-κB activation and calcium signaling [48, 49]. These findings establish a translational sequence from environmental exposure and biomarker correlation to controlled mechanistic modeling and histopathological confirmation, indicating that oxidative stress is a central mediator of NP cardiotoxicity. A parallel line of evidence implicates the vascular and hematologic systems as downstream targets of metal NP exposure. Complex firearms-derived aerosols containing mixed metal oxides (copper, zinc, and tin) provoke endothelial cytokine release and platelet activation, producing a prothrombotic profile even in the absence of ROS intermediates [50]. Complementary mechanistic models show that copper and zinc oxide NPs induce oxidative DNA damage, apoptosis, and dysregulation of vasoactive signaling, while cerium oxide produces minimal response, underscoring the role of composition and solubility in vascular risk [51–53]. Under physiological conditions, titanium dioxide NPs cause erythrocyte lysis only in serum-free systems, an effect neutralized by trace plasma proteins [54]. Palladium NPs tested in parallel airway, endothelial, and whole-blood models induce apoptosis, platelet consumption, and thrombin generation through kallikrein–kinin activation, despite weak surface-driven FXII autoactivation [55]. These data suggest a shifting emphasis from direct hemolysis to thrombo-inflammatory mechanisms as the predominant cardiovascular risk pathway for metal-based nanomaterials. Evidence from human and experimental studies indicates that metal-containing NPs can penetrate and interact with neural tissue, although the extent and character of the resulting toxicity vary according to particle composition, physicochemical properties, and biological context [56]. Autopsy investigations of young urban residents have revealed iron-, aluminum-, and titanium-rich NPs within the brainstem, including the substantia nigra, where they were co-localized with neuropathological markers of neurodegenerative disease such as hyperphosphorylated tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 [56]. Morphological assessment distinguished elongated titanium clusters (9 to 60 nm) associated with neuroenteric deposition from larger, spherical titanium dioxide particles typical of food sources (30 to 410 nm), suggesting distinct exposure routes: axonal transport for titanium and inhalation for aluminum and iron aggregates [56]. Though one study, it offers support for a model in which chronic environmental exposure to metal-containing NPs may catalyze protein misfolding and aggregation, promoting neurodegenerative pathology [56]. Experimental data from non-human neuronal systems provide complementary mechanistic evidence. While rodent-derived cell lines have shown that titanium dioxide NPs trigger oxidative stress–mediated apoptosis [57], findings in human-derived models are more variable. Comparative work across human lung, liver, glial, and neuronal cell lines has demonstrated robust NP internalization without corresponding increases in micronucleus formation or cytotoxicity, a finding attributed to the dynamic balance between endocytosis and exocytosis that modulates intracellular accumulation and may underlie the attenuated responses observed relative to animal models [43]. Further evidence from human neuronal and glial cultures exposed to cerium oxide NPs indicates minimal cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, even after extended exposures, consistent with the relatively low neurotoxicity observed in vivo and the proposed redox-stabilizing behavior of nanoceria [58]. Collectively, the literature delineates a gradient of neurotoxic response in which animal and non-human models consistently exhibit oxidative and apoptotic effects following exposure to metal-containing NPs, whereas human-derived systems display attenuated or variable outcomes. This divergence likely reflects species-specific differences in uptake dynamics, repair capacity, and NP persistence, underscoring the need for approaches that clarify the human relevance of NP-induced neurotoxicity. A study examining placental tissue from mothers with environmental air pollution exposure identified exogenous, carbonaceous NPs within tissue-resident phagocytic cells. Using magnetic analyses and electron microscopy, researchers confirmed these NPs were iron-rich, co-associated with other trace metals, and morphologically consistent with combustion- and friction-derived pollutants. This establishes that inhaled NPs can translocate systemically, cross into the placenta, and be taken up by placental cells, potentiating a direct pathway for fetal exposure to environmental and potentially occupational NPs [59]. Research on NP genotoxicity has progressed from descriptive demonstrations of DNA damage toward mechanistic and methodological refinement. Early human studies showed that sub-cytotoxic exposures could yield persistent genomic injury, with zinc oxide causing cumulative DNA fragmentation without apoptosis and titanium dioxide producing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and micronuclei formation, together implicating oxidative stress and inefficient DNA repair as key determinants of NP-induced genotoxicity [60, 61]. Later barrier-specific work revealed that different cell types vary in susceptibility: endothelial and macrophage-like cells displayed DNA damage and checkpoint activation, while A549 remained comparatively resistant, and altering glutathione content modulated outcomes [43, 62]. Additional studies expanded mechanistic understanding. Titanium-induced mucin and Toll-like receptor signaling clarified inflammatory pathways but contributed little to DNA-damage mechanisms [63], while comparative analyses of silver, gold, and platinum metallic NPs confirmed that silver remains uniquely genotoxic across particle sizes, reflecting dissolution-driven reactivity rather than size dependence [64]. In sums, these studies established that genotoxic potential depends not only on material reactivity but also on the antioxidant and repair capacities of individual cell types. Subsequent research shifted attention from simple strand-break detection to the cellular machinery governing persistence of damage. Titanium dioxide NPs were found to suppress both base- and nucleotide-excision repair activities and down-regulate multiple repair genes through promoter hypermethylation, linking exposure to transcriptional and epigenetic repression of repair capacity [65]. Epigenomic profiling extended this concept: short, non-cytotoxic exposures to various engineered nanomaterials altered DNA methylation of repetitive elements and decreased expression of DNA-methylation enzymes, suggesting that epigenetic drift could prolong genomic instability even after the exposure period ended [24, 42]. Zinc oxide exposure elicited pronounced oxidative and apoptotic signaling without activating key DNA repair pathways, and similar transcriptional profiling of cobalt and cerium oxide NPs showed that such stress responses vary by cell type, with stronger inflammatory signaling observed in macrophages, in contrast to the weaker oxidative activation seen in epithelial cells, indicating that NP-induced cellular stress often occurs without effective engagement of DNA repair mechanisms [34, 66, 67]. Parallel to mechanistic advances, modeling approaches for assessing NP genotoxicity underwent significant revision. The emergence of air–liquid interface (ALI) culture systems revealed that apparent DNA and cytotoxic damage often decreased under realistic aerosol deposition compared to submerged monolayers. Early ALI work showed negligible silver-NP cytotoxicity or inflammation at surface doses consistent with human exposure, challenging the reliability of conventional in vitro estimates [68, 69]; subsequent comparisons confirmed that once dosimetry and agglomeration were controlled, these systems yielded weaker acute responses than submerged cultures [70]. Multi-material testing in 3D bronchial tissue models further emphasized that genotoxicity largely tracked with the chemistry and solubility of the core material rather than particle size or coating. Only zinc oxide, citrate-stabilized silver, and a few silicon or zirconium oxides produced measurable DNA damage, while inert oxides were negative at comparable uptake fractions, and complementary airway co-culture models using human-relevant dosimetry showed similarly conservative outcomes, indicating that realistic tissue barriers substantially attenuate both genotoxic and inflammatory responses observed in simpler systems [71, 72]. Methodological realism continued to advance. Primary small-airway epithelium at the ALI exhibited transcriptomic and microRNA signatures of oxidative and genotoxic stress that paralleled in vivo inhalation findings, demonstrating that such barrier-competent systems can capture molecular responses at low, non-lethal doses [73]. Interlaboratory assessments later cautioned, however, that reproducibility of ALI endpoints remains variable and that even advanced 3-D constructs may miss subtle genotoxic effects at realistic exposures [74]. These investigations show that NP genotoxicity cannot be reduced to a single determinant: oxidative stress, deficient repair activation, and epigenetic dysregulation all contribute, while improved modeling has tempered apparent hazard by introducing realistic deposition and tissue barriers. The evolution from descriptive findings to mechanistic clarity is well illustrated by the research trajectory of cobalt NPs. Early studies demonstrated that cobalt-containing particulates could damage DNA in human cells [75–77]. These reports showed that cobalt metal, cobalt–tungsten carbide, and cobalt chloride caused DNA strand breaks and inhibited repair in isolated human lymphocytes, and later work extended these findings to nanoscale cobalt systems where oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities were observed in human bronchial and leukocyte models [76, 77]. Although methodologically limited, this early work introduced the concept that cobalt particulates in nanoscale form possess intrinsic genotoxic potential through oxidative and repair-interfering mechanisms rather than through overt cytotoxicity alone. Subsequent research refined these observations into a mechanistic framework focused on cobalt oxides, particularly Co₃O₄ [40, 78, 79]. These cobalt oxide NPs were shown to elicit both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human hepatocellular and respiratory models, with oxidative stress as a unifying mediator and minimal contribution from ionic cobalt [40, 79]. Across these studies, cobalt oxides produced little overt cytotoxicity but clear oxidative and genotoxic effects consistent with a “Trojan horse” mechanism in which intracellular particle uptake and localized dissolution generate reactive cobalt ions that damage DNA [78, 79]. Under sub-cytotoxic conditions, single-strand DNA breaks were observed in bronchial epithelial cells, implicating ROS as the direct driver of genotoxicity [78]. Collectively, this phase of research marked a shift from describing cobalt-induced DNA damage to explaining how physicochemical properties, especially solubility and intracellular dissolution, determine the balance between cytotoxic and genotoxic outcomes. A clear inflection point in this trajectory was reached when standardized comparative testing showed that cobalt metal and cobalt(II) oxide NPs exhibited marked oxidative and genotoxic activity in human lung epithelial cells, whereas cobalt(II, III) oxide, although efficiently internalized, produced negligible oxidative stress or DNA damage [80]. This clarified that low solubility can limit cobalt ion release sufficiently to suppress observable biological reactivity. This progression redefined cobalt nanotoxicology from a descriptive field identifying genotoxic hazards to a mechanistic discipline capable of distinguishing when and why cobalt oxide NPs cause oxidative DNA injury despite minimal cytotoxicity. The uptake of aerosolized nanometals in industry, commercial or home products is expected to occur via nasal or oral inhalation, as one of the earliest and most relevant routes of exposure in occupational and environmental toxicology. The majority of cell-based modelling of respiratory-related nanometal effects has focused on toxicant-mediated pathogenic effects of intranasal, buccal, bronchial, tracheal, and alveolar epithelial cells. Chemical composition analyses of occupational or environmental exposures, such as welding fumes, firearm fumes or other ballistic aerosols, often identify a range of chemical and metal constituents for study [50, 81–84]. Studies have demonstrated titanium and iron NPs in coal fly ash, and, in firearm fumes, aluminum, antimony, barium, calcium, copper, iron, potassium, lead, sulfur, sodium, strontium, tin, zinc, tungsten, nickel, iron, and cobalt [85]. Welding fumes produce a mixture of iron, manganese, nickel, chromium, scandium, vanadium, cobalt, copper, rubidium, niobium, and cesium, and indoor combustion sources such as incense and mosquito coils produce cadmium NPs [86–88]. Welding fumes containing iron and manganese NPs elicit strong cytokine signaling in respiratory epithelia, particularly via IL-8, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, and HO-1, with IL-8 often predominating; comparable IL-8 upregulation occurs with zinc oxide and related metal oxide NPs through NFκB- and C/EBPβ-dependent transcription and mRNA stabilization mechanisms, and concurrent induction of HO-1 and metallothionein serves as a general marker of metal-oxide cytotoxicity [11, 89–91]. Taken together, these models suggest a risk for carcinogenicity, epithelial toxicity, and cytotoxicity. Common findings among respiratory epithelial cell models show that metal-containing NPs, to varying extents depending on their composition, generate ROS and cause cytotoxicity, with the greatest effects observed for zinc, copper, and nickel oxides [91, 92]. Zinc oxide NPs have demonstrated altered gene expression of immune cells, induction of ROS, increased cytokine signaling and cytotoxicity [89, 93–95]. Implicated mechanisms for zinc oxide cytotoxicity are related to intracellular dissolution, which leads to zinc ion homeostatic disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis [96]; other mechanisms are mitochondrial inhibition of complex I and II, altered mitochondrial fission and fusion protein expression, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by ROS and NF-kb, and interactions with lung surfactant components like dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which increases the membrane damage caused by zinc oxide NPs [93–98]. Induction of ROS and cytotoxicity has been similarly demonstrated in bronchial epithelial and alveolar cell modeling of titanium dioxide, gold, palladium, lead halide perovskite, iron, and manganese [11, 30, 37, 55, 93–95, 99, 100]. Induction of apoptosis in alveolar cells is demonstratable with model exposures to zinc, nickel, and tungsten carbide cobalt NPs [92, 101, 102]. Titanium dioxide is present as a ubiquitous whitening pigment and is widely used in catalytic and photocatalytic applications such as water and air filtration and self-cleaning surfaces. Models of respiratory toxicity from titanium dioxide have been conflicting, with several studies failing to demonstrate cytotoxicity or micronuclei genotoxicity markers at varying concentrations and in various cells lines [43, 74, 103, 104]. However, titanium dioxide exposed alveolar and bronchial models have shown altered expression of histone deacetylase 9, which is an epigenetic modifier, and that production of ROS, cytotoxicity, glutathione production, and DNA double strand breaks are influenced by titanium dioxide agglomeration, the presence of a more toxic nanofiber rather than nanoparticle, or the predominance of the anatase or rutile structure [30, 99, 105–107]. Interactions with the pulmonary surfactant is a critical factor, as components like DPPC have been shown to coat silver nanoparticles, improving their dispersion and delaying the release of toxic ions [108]. Shotgun proteomics, a high-throughput mass-spectrometry technique that identifies and quantifies proteins from complex mixtures, have identified one underlying mechanism as the dysregulation of protein phosphorylation sites, with subsequent impact on DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, autophagy and cytoskeletal structure and dynamics, cellular transport, RNA dynamics, with a central role of p53 [65]. Epithelial barrier integrity, as in studies of genotoxicity, represents a central determinant of NP behavior in vitro, shaping both apparent toxicity and the way experimental results are extrapolated to human risk. Barrier status influences not only particle uptake and translocation but also the interpretation of downstream effects such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell viability. Modern respiratory models increasingly emphasize this point through advanced in vitro systems that recapitulate the ALI, allowing aerosolized nanometal exposures to occur under physiologically relevant conditions [74, 109–111]. These systems demonstrate that deposition dynamics, dissolution, and ionic transformation vary substantially from submerged monolayer cultures, leading to lower apparent toxicity at realistic doses. Methodological refinements, including electrostatic deposition, dynamic flow exposure, and barrier maturation protocols, have enabled closer approximation to in vivo airway deposition while highlighting the role of serum and protein coronas in modulating NP reactivity [112, 113]. Multiparametric approaches have further clarified that protein adsorption and cytokine binding can confound apparent inflammatory outcomes in submerged assays, reinforcing the need for integrated evaluation of intracellular, secreted, and transcriptional endpoints [114]. Collectively, these studies mark a shift from simplified cytotoxicity assays toward barrier-competent reagents that can distinguish direct nanomaterial effects from secondary phenomena related to barrier disruption or ion-mediated stress. With these modeling advances established, current research has turned toward the consequences of barrier loss itself, examining how disruption of tight and adherens junctions alters respiratory permeability and permits NP translocation into systemic circulation and target organs. Loss of barrier integrity in this manners, independent of cytotoxicity and altered gene expression, has been demonstrated with silver and tungsten NPs as well as titanium dioxide [103, 115, 116]. Notably, the loss of cell membrane integrity induced by nano zero-valent iron and zinc oxide NPs occurs via inflammatory responses in endothelial cells and is concurrent with production of ROS, cytotoxicity, and cytokine signaling [89, 117, 118]. Disruption of tight junctions is associated with multiple atopic and inflammatory disease states, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease [115]. However, loss of epithelial barrier integrity is not a consistent finding across models; one 3D bronchial epithelial model (Calu-3) for silver NPs did not disrupt epithelial barriers or induce cytotoxicity [119]. These advances redefine respiratory nanotoxicology by shifting attention from isolated cytotoxic endpoints to barrier-dependent mechanisms of injury and repair. Another critical determinant of respiratory response is the pulmonary surfactant layer that lines the alveoli and airways. This lipid–protein interface governs NP dispersion, dissolution, and cellular contact, yet its influence on toxicity remains context dependent. Natural surfactant mixtures can attenuate silver NP cytotoxicity by limiting ionic release [120], whereas other formulations fail to suppress the oxidative or inflammatory effects of silver nanowires [121]. In some cases, single surfactant components such as DPPC even exacerbate oxidative stress and cytokine signaling [122]. For zinc oxide nanowires, surfactant coatings delayed early cell death but increased uptake and delayed toxicity [123]. These findings illustrate that pulmonary surfactant interactions are a key but variable modifier of NP behavior, and that faithfully incorporating the biochemical and biophysical complexity of this interface into advanced airway models remains a continuing methodological limitation in respiratory nanotoxicology. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular program in which epithelial cells lose polarity and adhesion, acquiring migratory and fibroblast-like traits central to fibrosis and remodeling. NP exposure can induce EMT through oxidative stress and DNA damage–mediated activation of the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 base-excision repair pathway [124]. Palladium NPs from catalytic converters and lead perovskite both trigger EMT in bronchial epithelial cells via TGF-β1 signaling, implicating EMT dysregulation in fibrotic and structural lung disease [55, 100]. Uncoated cerium oxide NPs, over 80% internalized by lung epithelium within 24 h, directly stimulate collagen synthesis and fibroblastic nodule formation in human lung fibroblasts-effects mitigated by silica coating as a safety-by-design measure [125, 126]. Titanium- and iron-based cosmetic aerosols deposit ultrafine particles in tracheobronchial regions, where exposure produces greater oxidative stress and accumulation of 8-oxoguanine DNA lesions than equivalent doses of pristine titanium or iron NPs [124]. Beyond epithelial effects, zinc oxide and copper oxide NPs diminish airway smooth-muscle contractility through non-ROS biomechanical mechanisms [127], suggesting a broader role of nanometal exposure in respiratory dysfunction. Considered in context, these findings indicate that NP toxicity in the respiratory tract arises less from size alone than from persistent oxidative and signaling disruptions that reprogram both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments. Understanding NP toxicity requires accounting for the exposure phase, particle chemistry, and realistic dosing. As previously discussed, most in vitro studies utilize submerged cell cultures; however, these systems do not entirely replicate the manner in which aerosols interact with airway surfaces. Comparisons under equivalent mass doses show that zinc oxide NPs delivered as aerosols produce earlier oxidative and inflammatory responses than suspensions, with peak effects at four hours instead of twenty-four, but the total response magnitude later converges, indicating that liquid systems delay but do not prevent cellular injury [128]. Chemical transformations in air further influence toxicity: magnetite NPs coated by acidic or organic films release more soluble iron and provoke stronger oxidative and cytokine responses than uncoated forms [129]. Atmospheric processing, not only composition or size, determines biological activity. Controlled human inhalation studies define the boundary between mechanistic data and occupational exposure. Inhalation of 0.5 mg/m³ zinc oxide produced no measurable systemic or respiratory effects [130]. Subsequent work demonstrated a concentration-dependent inflammatory response across 0.5–2 mg/m³ nano-ZnO, with significant increases in neutrophils and acute-phase proteins at and above 1 mg/m³, defining the lower threshold for transient systemic effects [131]. A later comparison at 2 mg/m³ under exertion showed similar responses for nano- and micro-ZnO, with slightly higher values for the latter due to greater deposition efficiency rather than particle size toxicity [132]. Across these investigations, toxicity scaled primarily with deposited mass and ionic dissolution rather than nominal particle size. Simulations of workplace aerosols demonstrate that biologically relevant cellular doses are orders of magnitude lower than those typically applied in in vitro toxicology studies [12]. These modeling approaches define the concentration range within which experimental data can be meaningfully compared to human exposure scenarios. Field measurements complement this framework by confirming that respirable NPs are generated under ordinary use conditions. For example, commercial spray products emitting titanium dioxide can transiently exceed recommended exposure limits during brief applications [13]. Broader assessments show that indoor nanomaterial measurements often capture mixed emissions from combustion sources and process aerosols rather than the engineered product itself [14]. These findings link modeled exposure potential with real-world aerosol occurrence, showing that accurate interpretation of NP toxicity requires consideration of realistic dose levels and environmental context, as demonstrated in occupational settings such as welding and firearm exposure. While metal fume fever has been recognized for decades [133], the contribution of nano-sized particulate matter is now being described. Lung-tissue analysis of professional welders identified iron, manganese, and chromium oxide NPs within macrophages and fibrotic regions, linking chronic exposure to persistent inflammation [134]. Modeled airflow studies indicate that only about 1% of welding-fume agglomerates deposit in the olfactory mucosa, but morphology, long chains versus compact clusters, strongly influences this fraction [135]. Thus, particle geometry contributes to deposition and potential for systemic translocation. Because manganese constitutes a major component of many welding aerosols, these deposition patterns have important implications for neurotoxicity, with elevated blood manganese levels linked to basal ganglia hyperintensity on MRI and reduced working-memory performance in exposed workers even at routine exposure levels [136, 137]. Controlled exposure of apprentice welders to tungsten inert gas fumes demonstrated transient oxidative stress, with elevated hydrogen peroxide and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in plasma and urine three hours post-exposure [138]. Comparable findings in active stainless-steel welders showed chromium and nickel in exhaled breath condensate correlated with oxidative biomarkers [139]. Quantitative exposure measurements reinforce this relevance. Comparative monitoring of carbon-steel and aluminum welding revealed alveolar-deposited surface areas exceeding tens of thousands of µm²/cm³, demonstrating that even low-fume processes emit respirable ultrafine particles [140]. This is convergent evidence that welding aerosols contribute to measurable biological stress, with deposition behavior, surface area, and transition-metal content as key determinants of effect. Military facilities and indoor firing ranges generate complex aerosols composed of ultrafine metals and combustion gases. Characterization of shooting-range air shows that it contains respirable lead and antimony particles with high alveolar deposition potential [81]. Replacement of lead-based ammunition with alternative compositions reduces classical toxicants but introduces copper, zinc, manganese, and boron NPs, shifting rather than removing risk [81]. Experimental studies using collected firearm particles demonstrate oxidative stress and cytokine release in lung epithelial cultures, with highest toxicity from copper- and zinc-rich emissions [83]. ALI exposures to freshly generated firearm discharge confirm that these aerosols reduce cell viability and induce IL-8 signaling, with rifle fire producing greater effects than handguns [141]. Controlled exposures of ALI cultures to fumes from steel-core ammunition show similar findings, including genotoxicity linked to transition-metal and gas co-pollutant mixtures [82]. Human monitoring extends these observations. Repeated occupational exposure among firearm instructors is associated with oxidative-stress biomarkers and elevated urinary copper despite airborne metal levels below current limits [142]. Studies in police instructors exposed to similar ultrafine particle environments showed small, non-significant increases in inflammatory and endothelial markers, suggesting possible early biological responses that warrant continued investigation [143]. That said, while these studies suggest only mild or subclinical biological responses, the absence of pronounced nanometal toxicity should not be interpreted as evidence of safety, since firing-range personnel commonly exhibit elevated blood lead levels consistent with ongoing cumulative metal exposure [144–146]."

      "text": "Early studies established that engineered NPs can engage the immune system to produce inflammatory responses, yet even at that time researchers recognized that surface chemistry, crystal structure, and particle size strongly influenced this behavior [18]. Experiments demonstrated that exposure to metal oxides such as titanium dioxide activated macrophages and epithelial cells, leading to release of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. This response was later refined through mechanistic work showing that inflammasome activation and IL-1β release represent a central component of the innate immune reaction [19, 20]. Upstream signaling studies demonstrated that NP exposure can induce oxidative stress mediators such as macrophage migration-inhibitory factor and amplify cytokine release through interactions with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, indicating that immune modulation occurs both before and after inflammasome activation [21, 22]. Even when overt cytotoxicity or inflammation are absent, suppression of immune signaling and impairment of host defense can still occur, highlighting a parallel mechanism of risk [23]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that metal-containing NPs can induce persistent immune modulation across multiple regulatory levels, with short exposures altering methylation and transcription of immune-related genes and corresponding human data showing long non-coding RNA shifts linked to IL-6 and cardiovascular inflammation, while copper oxide exposure produced oxidative and mitochondrial injury in lymphocytes consistent with these transcriptional effects [24–26]. Transcriptomic profiling in bronchial epithelia from asthmatic and healthy donors further revealed that copper oxide NPs elicit stronger IL-6 and IL-8 signaling and altered ciliary and metallothionein gene expression in asthmatic airways, underscoring how disease state and surface chemistry together modulate immune sensitivity [27]. Crystalline form further shapes the magnitude and nature of immune activation. Titanium dioxide commonly occurs as anatase or rutile, and these phases differ in surface energy, photocatalytic activity, and redox potential. Anatase typically exhibits stronger oxidative and inflammatory activity, whereas rutile tends to produce weaker but composition-dependent responses [18]. These distinctions were quantified through systematic variation of particle characteristics showing that IL-1β release is governed by size, shape, and crystal phase through a shared oxidative and lysosomal mechanism [28]. Later work extended this to endothelial and monocyte adhesion models, demonstrating that mixed anatase–rutile formulations differentially regulate receptor expression and inflammatory signaling [29]. Ultimately, the relationship between particle architecture and dissolution behavior has been crucial to understanding immune responses. Agglomeration state affects macrophage uptake and cytokine production, with larger aggregates of titanium dioxide provoking stronger IL-1β and IL-8 release despite identical chemical composition [30]. Moreover, poorly dissolved NPs can induce membrane disruption and cytotoxicity even when ionic release is minimal, underscoring that dissolution kinetics alone do not determine toxicity [31]. Collectively, these findings indicate that NP–immune interactions are dictated by a combination of surface reactivity, crystalline structure, aggregation, and persistence rather than by particle size or composition alone."

      "title": "Gastrointestinal system",
      "text": "NP interaction with the gastrointestinal barrier is a dynamic process defined less by passive diffusion and more by physicochemical transformation [30, 32, 33]. Studies of oral and intestinal epithelia show that particle size, surface charge, and agglomeration determine whether nanomaterials remain confined to mucus layers or traverse into the subepithelial compartment [32, 33]. Dissolution begins at this interface, where metal oxides such as zinc and copper release ions, while more inert materials such as titanium largely maintain particulate form [34–36]. This early dissolution alters aggregation and membrane affinity, reshaping exposure chemistry before systemic entry [30, 34, 35]. The resulting translocation is not governed by size alone but by the balance between particle stability and solubility, with loosely bound or partially dissolved species entering circulation more readily than intact aggregates [33–35]. Within this framework, epithelial toxicity involving tight junction disruption, redox imbalance, and limited inflammatory signaling reflects not a single mechanism but the composite outcome of dissolution kinetics and surface reactivity [30, 35, 37]. Once systemically distributed, these same dissolution dynamics define the hepatic response [36, 38–40]. The liver receives NPs both as intact aggregates and as dissolved metal ions, and distinguishing between these forms is central to interpreting toxicological outcomes [39, 41]. Across zinc, copper, cobalt, and lead oxides, hepatocellular injury consistently aligns with oxidative stress secondary to ionic release rather than unique nanoscale effects [36, 39, 40]. That said, while most evidence links gastrointestinal toxicity to dissolution and ionic activity, some findings indicate that particulate mechanisms can contribute independently; in a comparative study of aluminum-based nanomaterials, minimal ionic release did not prevent the induction of oxidative DNA lesions in intestinal cells, while ionic aluminum salts produced no comparable damage [42]. Intracellular dissolution, sometimes accelerated by acidic lysosomal conditions, can amplify this effect, producing a “Trojan horse” scenario in which nominally insoluble particles deliver concentrated bursts of bioavailable metal within hepatocytes [36, 39]. This intracellular release disrupts mitochondrial potential, disturbs ATP balance, and activates gluconeogenic and lipid-handling pathways that resemble early steatosis or metabolic injury [36, 39, 40]. The resulting oxidative and metabolic stress profile blurs the distinction between NP and heavy-metal toxicity, emphasizing that for many oxides, hepatotoxicity is chemically rather than structurally mediated [39–41]. Viewed together, the data converge on dissolution as the mechanistic bridge between local epithelial disruption and systemic metabolic toxicity [34–36, 39]. Particle integrity determines exposure site, but solubility determines biological consequence [30, 36]. NPs that remain stable, such as titanium dioxide, tend to accumulate with limited acute cytotoxicity [30, 32, 43], while those prone to ion release provoke oxidative and metabolic stress across tissues [34, 35, 39, 40]. The central challenge for future research lies in separating the genuinely nano-enabled behaviors, such as intracellular transport, compartmentalized dissolution, and prolonged retention, from effects explainable by classical metal toxicity [36, 38, 39]."

      "text": "The skin serves as both a physical barrier and a potential portal for NP interaction in occupational and consumer contexts. Early studies using keratinocyte monolayers showed that titanium dioxide NPs induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and oxidative DNA lesions, including micronucleus formation, without marked cytotoxicity or loss of proliferation [44, 45]. Subsequent work with copper oxide reported similar oxidative stress responses but with stronger reductions in cell viability, likely related to copper ion dissolution [46]. Studies of zinc oxide further refined this model by demonstrating that stress responses extend beyond ROS generation, encompassing transcriptional activation of metallothioneins, heat shock proteins, and DNA-damage–response genes in both keratinocytes and melanocytes [34]. Collectively, these findings reflect a progression from descriptive toxicity toward a mechanistic understanding centered on oxidative and stress-signaling pathways as the primary mediators of cutaneous NP responses. Three-dimensional reconstructed epidermal models show that materials cytotoxic in submerged monolayer cultures, including degraded graphene–manganese oxide composites, do not trigger significant irritation when the epidermal barrier is preserved [37]. These studies suggest that while oxidative stress is a common mechanistic endpoint across NP types, the intact stratum corneum effectively mitigates biological impact, emphasizing the importance of exposure context in dermal risk evaluation."

Autopsy findings of iron-rich NPs embedded within myocardial mitochondria revealed mitochondrial deformation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and elevated oxidative markers consistent with Fenton-type reactivity [47]. These pathological observations are reinforced by occupational data linking exposure to metal fume PM2.5 with systemic oxidative biomarkers in welders and by 3D vascularized models that replicate NP-induced endothelial permeability and vasoconstriction through NF-κB activation and calcium signaling [48, 49]. These findings establish a translational sequence from environmental exposure and biomarker correlation to controlled mechanistic modeling and histopathological confirmation, indicating that oxidative stress is a central mediator of NP cardiotoxicity."

Complex firearms-derived aerosols containing mixed metal oxides (copper, zinc, and tin) provoke endothelial cytokine release and platelet activation, producing a prothrombotic profile even in the absence of ROS intermediates [50]. Complementary mechanistic models show that copper and zinc oxide NPs induce oxidative DNA damage, apoptosis, and dysregulation of vasoactive signaling, while cerium oxide produces minimal response, underscoring the role of composition and solubility in vascular risk [51–53]. Under physiological conditions, titanium dioxide NPs cause erythrocyte lysis only in serum-free systems, an effect neutralized by trace plasma proteins [54]. Palladium NPs tested in parallel airway, endothelial, and whole-blood models induce apoptosis, platelet consumption, and thrombin generation through kallikrein–kinin activation, despite weak surface-driven FXII autoactivation [55]. These data suggest a shifting emphasis from direct hemolysis to thrombo-inflammatory mechanisms as the predominant cardiovascular risk pathway for metal-based nanomaterials."

      "text": "Evidence from human and experimental studies indicates that metal-containing NPs can penetrate and interact with neural tissue, although the extent and character of the resulting toxicity vary according to particle composition, physicochemical properties, and biological context [56]. Autopsy investigations of young urban residents have revealed iron-, aluminum-, and titanium-rich NPs within the brainstem, including the substantia nigra, where they were co-localized with neuropathological markers of neurodegenerative disease such as hyperphosphorylated tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 [56]. Morphological assessment distinguished elongated titanium clusters (9 to 60 nm) associated with neuroenteric deposition from larger, spherical titanium dioxide particles typical of food sources (30 to 410 nm), suggesting distinct exposure routes: axonal transport for titanium and inhalation for aluminum and iron aggregates [56]. Though one study, it offers support for a model in which chronic environmental exposure to metal-containing NPs may catalyze protein misfolding and aggregation, promoting neurodegenerative pathology [56]. Experimental data from non-human neuronal systems provide complementary mechanistic evidence. While rodent-derived cell lines have shown that titanium dioxide NPs trigger oxidative stress–mediated apoptosis [57], findings in human-derived models are more variable. Comparative work across human lung, liver, glial, and neuronal cell lines has demonstrated robust NP internalization without corresponding increases in micronucleus formation or cytotoxicity, a finding attributed to the dynamic balance between endocytosis and exocytosis that modulates intracellular accumulation and may underlie the attenuated responses observed relative to animal models [43]. Further evidence from human neuronal and glial cultures exposed to cerium oxide NPs indicates minimal cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, even after extended exposures, consistent with the relatively low neurotoxicity observed in vivo and the proposed redox-stabilizing behavior of nanoceria [58]. Collectively, the literature delineates a gradient of neurotoxic response in which animal and non-human models consistently exhibit oxidative and apoptotic effects following exposure to metal-containing NPs, whereas human-derived systems display attenuated or variable outcomes. This divergence likely reflects species-specific differences in uptake dynamics, repair capacity, and NP persistence, underscoring the need for approaches that clarify the human relevance of NP-induced neurotoxicity."

This establishes that inhaled NPs can translocate systemically, cross into the placenta, and be taken up by placental cells, potentiating a direct pathway for fetal exposure to environmental and potentially occupational NPs [59]."

      "title": "Genotoxicity",
      "text": "Research on NP genotoxicity has progressed from descriptive demonstrations of DNA damage toward mechanistic and methodological refinement. Early human studies showed that sub-cytotoxic exposures could yield persistent genomic injury, with zinc oxide causing cumulative DNA fragmentation without apoptosis and titanium dioxide producing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and micronuclei formation, together implicating oxidative stress and inefficient DNA repair as key determinants of NP-induced genotoxicity [60, 61]. Later barrier-specific work revealed that different cell types vary in susceptibility: endothelial and macrophage-like cells displayed DNA damage and checkpoint activation, while A549 remained comparatively resistant, and altering glutathione content modulated outcomes [43, 62]. Additional studies expanded mechanistic understanding. Titanium-induced mucin and Toll-like receptor signaling clarified inflammatory pathways but contributed little to DNA-damage mechanisms [63], while comparative analyses of silver, gold, and platinum metallic NPs confirmed that silver remains uniquely genotoxic across particle sizes, reflecting dissolution-driven reactivity rather than size dependence [64]. In sums, these studies established that genotoxic potential depends not only on material reactivity but also on the antioxidant and repair capacities of individual cell types. Subsequent research shifted attention from simple strand-break detection to the cellular machinery governing persistence of damage. Titanium dioxide NPs were found to suppress both base- and nucleotide-excision repair activities and down-regulate multiple repair genes through promoter hypermethylation, linking exposure to transcriptional and epigenetic repression of repair capacity [65]. Epigenomic profiling extended this concept: short, non-cytotoxic exposures to various engineered nanomaterials altered DNA methylation of repetitive elements and decreased expression of DNA-methylation enzymes, suggesting that epigenetic drift could prolong genomic instability even after the exposure period ended [24, 42]. Zinc oxide exposure elicited pronounced oxidative and apoptotic signaling without activating key DNA repair pathways, and similar transcriptional profiling of cobalt and cerium oxide NPs showed that such stress responses vary by cell type, with stronger inflammatory signaling observed in macrophages, in contrast to the weaker oxidative activation seen in epithelial cells, indicating that NP-induced cellular stress often occurs without effective engagement of DNA repair mechanisms [34, 66, 67]. Parallel to mechanistic advances, modeling approaches for assessing NP genotoxicity underwent significant revision. The emergence of air–liquid interface (ALI) culture systems revealed that apparent DNA and cytotoxic damage often decreased under realistic aerosol deposition compared to submerged monolayers. Early ALI work showed negligible silver-NP cytotoxicity or inflammation at surface doses consistent with human exposure, challenging the reliability of conventional in vitro estimates [68, 69]; subsequent comparisons confirmed that once dosimetry and agglomeration were controlled, these systems yielded weaker acute responses than submerged cultures [70]. Multi-material testing in 3D bronchial tissue models further emphasized that genotoxicity largely tracked with the chemistry and solubility of the core material rather than particle size or coating. Only zinc oxide, citrate-stabilized silver, and a few silicon or zirconium oxides produced measurable DNA damage, while inert oxides were negative at comparable uptake fractions, and complementary airway co-culture models using human-relevant dosimetry showed similarly conservative outcomes, indicating that realistic tissue barriers substantially attenuate both genotoxic and inflammatory responses observed in simpler systems [71, 72]. Methodological realism continued to advance. Primary small-airway epithelium at the ALI exhibited transcriptomic and microRNA signatures of oxidative and genotoxic stress that paralleled in vivo inhalation findings, demonstrating that such barrier-competent systems can capture molecular responses at low, non-lethal doses [73]. Interlaboratory assessments later cautioned, however, that reproducibility of ALI endpoints remains variable and that even advanced 3-D constructs may miss subtle genotoxic effects at realistic exposures [74]. These investigations show that NP genotoxicity cannot be reduced to a single determinant: oxidative stress, deficient repair activation, and epigenetic dysregulation all contribute, while improved modeling has tempered apparent hazard by introducing realistic deposition and tissue barriers. The evolution from descriptive findings to mechanistic clarity is well illustrated by the research trajectory of cobalt NPs. Early studies demonstrated that cobalt-containing particulates could damage DNA in human cells [75–77]. These reports showed that cobalt metal, cobalt–tungsten carbide, and cobalt chloride caused DNA strand breaks and inhibited repair in isolated human lymphocytes, and later work extended these findings to nanoscale cobalt systems where oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities were observed in human bronchial and leukocyte models [76, 77]. Although methodologically limited, this early work introduced the concept that cobalt particulates in nanoscale form possess intrinsic genotoxic potential through oxidative and repair-interfering mechanisms rather than through overt cytotoxicity alone. Subsequent research refined these observations into a mechanistic framework focused on cobalt oxides, particularly Co₃O₄ [40, 78, 79]. These cobalt oxide NPs were shown to elicit both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human hepatocellular and respiratory models, with oxidative stress as a unifying mediator and minimal contribution from ionic cobalt [40, 79]. Across these studies, cobalt oxides produced little overt cytotoxicity but clear oxidative and genotoxic effects consistent with a “Trojan horse” mechanism in which intracellular particle uptake and localized dissolution generate reactive cobalt ions that damage DNA [78, 79]. Under sub-cytotoxic conditions, single-strand DNA breaks were observed in bronchial epithelial cells, implicating ROS as the direct driver of genotoxicity [78]. Collectively, this phase of research marked a shift from describing cobalt-induced DNA damage to explaining how physicochemical properties, especially solubility and intracellular dissolution, determine the balance between cytotoxic and genotoxic outcomes. A clear inflection point in this trajectory was reached when standardized comparative testing showed that cobalt metal and cobalt(II) oxide NPs exhibited marked oxidative and genotoxic activity in human lung epithelial cells, whereas cobalt(II, III) oxide, although efficiently internalized, produced negligible oxidative stress or DNA damage [80]. This clarified that low solubility can limit cobalt ion release sufficiently to suppress observable biological reactivity. This progression redefined cobalt nanotoxicology from a descriptive field identifying genotoxic hazards to a mechanistic discipline capable of distinguishing when and why cobalt oxide NPs cause oxidative DNA injury despite minimal cytotoxicity."

      "text": "The uptake of aerosolized nanometals in industry, commercial or home products is expected to occur via nasal or oral inhalation, as one of the earliest and most relevant routes of exposure in occupational and environmental toxicology. The majority of cell-based modelling of respiratory-related nanometal effects has focused on toxicant-mediated pathogenic effects of intranasal, buccal, bronchial, tracheal, and alveolar epithelial cells. Chemical composition analyses of occupational or environmental exposures, such as welding fumes, firearm fumes or other ballistic aerosols, often identify a range of chemical and metal constituents for study [50, 81–84]. Studies have demonstrated titanium and iron NPs in coal fly ash, and, in firearm fumes, aluminum, antimony, barium, calcium, copper, iron, potassium, lead, sulfur, sodium, strontium, tin, zinc, tungsten, nickel, iron, and cobalt [85]. Welding fumes produce a mixture of iron, manganese, nickel, chromium, scandium, vanadium, cobalt, copper, rubidium, niobium, and cesium, and indoor combustion sources such as incense and mosquito coils produce cadmium NPs [86–88]. Welding fumes containing iron and manganese NPs elicit strong cytokine signaling in respiratory epithelia, particularly via IL-8, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, and HO-1, with IL-8 often predominating; comparable IL-8 upregulation occurs with zinc oxide and related metal oxide NPs through NFκB- and C/EBPβ-dependent transcription and mRNA stabilization mechanisms, and concurrent induction of HO-1 and metallothionein serves as a general marker of metal-oxide cytotoxicity [11, 89–91]. Taken together, these models suggest a risk for carcinogenicity, epithelial toxicity, and cytotoxicity. Common findings among respiratory epithelial cell models show that metal-containing NPs, to varying extents depending on their composition, generate ROS and cause cytotoxicity, with the greatest effects observed for zinc, copper, and nickel oxides [91, 92]. Zinc oxide NPs have demonstrated altered gene expression of immune cells, induction of ROS, increased cytokine signaling and cytotoxicity [89, 93–95]. Implicated mechanisms for zinc oxide cytotoxicity are related to intracellular dissolution, which leads to zinc ion homeostatic disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis [96]; other mechanisms are mitochondrial inhibition of complex I and II, altered mitochondrial fission and fusion protein expression, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by ROS and NF-kb, and interactions with lung surfactant components like dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which increases the membrane damage caused by zinc oxide NPs [93–98]. Induction of ROS and cytotoxicity has been similarly demonstrated in bronchial epithelial and alveolar cell modeling of titanium dioxide, gold, palladium, lead halide perovskite, iron, and manganese [11, 30, 37, 55, 93–95, 99, 100]. Induction of apoptosis in alveolar cells is demonstratable with model exposures to zinc, nickel, and tungsten carbide cobalt NPs [92, 101, 102]. Titanium dioxide is present as a ubiquitous whitening pigment and is widely used in catalytic and photocatalytic applications such as water and air filtration and self-cleaning surfaces. Models of respiratory toxicity from titanium dioxide have been conflicting, with several studies failing to demonstrate cytotoxicity or micronuclei genotoxicity markers at varying concentrations and in various cells lines [43, 74, 103, 104]. However, titanium dioxide exposed alveolar and bronchial models have shown altered expression of histone deacetylase 9, which is an epigenetic modifier, and that production of ROS, cytotoxicity, glutathione production, and DNA double strand breaks are influenced by titanium dioxide agglomeration, the presence of a more toxic nanofiber rather than nanoparticle, or the predominance of the anatase or rutile structure [30, 99, 105–107]. Interactions with the pulmonary surfactant is a critical factor, as components like DPPC have been shown to coat silver nanoparticles, improving their dispersion and delaying the release of toxic ions [108]. Shotgun proteomics, a high-throughput mass-spectrometry technique that identifies and quantifies proteins from complex mixtures, have identified one underlying mechanism as the dysregulation of protein phosphorylation sites, with subsequent impact on DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, autophagy and cytoskeletal structure and dynamics, cellular transport, RNA dynamics, with a central role of p53 [65]. Epithelial barrier integrity, as in studies of genotoxicity, represents a central determinant of NP behavior in vitro, shaping both apparent toxicity and the way experimental results are extrapolated to human risk. Barrier status influences not only particle uptake and translocation but also the interpretation of downstream effects such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell viability. Modern respiratory models increasingly emphasize this point through advanced in vitro systems that recapitulate the ALI, allowing aerosolized nanometal exposures to occur under physiologically relevant conditions [74, 109–111]. These systems demonstrate that deposition dynamics, dissolution, and ionic transformation vary substantially from submerged monolayer cultures, leading to lower apparent toxicity at realistic doses. Methodological refinements, including electrostatic deposition, dynamic flow exposure, and barrier maturation protocols, have enabled closer approximation to in vivo airway deposition while highlighting the role of serum and protein coronas in modulating NP reactivity [112, 113]. Multiparametric approaches have further clarified that protein adsorption and cytokine binding can confound apparent inflammatory outcomes in submerged assays, reinforcing the need for integrated evaluation of intracellular, secreted, and transcriptional endpoints [114]. Collectively, these studies mark a shift from simplified cytotoxicity assays toward barrier-competent reagents that can distinguish direct nanomaterial effects from secondary phenomena related to barrier disruption or ion-mediated stress. With these modeling advances established, current research has turned toward the consequences of barrier loss itself, examining how disruption of tight and adherens junctions alters respiratory permeability and permits NP translocation into systemic circulation and target organs. Loss of barrier integrity in this manners, independent of cytotoxicity and altered gene expression, has been demonstrated with silver and tungsten NPs as well as titanium dioxide [103, 115, 116]. Notably, the loss of cell membrane integrity induced by nano zero-valent iron and zinc oxide NPs occurs via inflammatory responses in endothelial cells and is concurrent with production of ROS, cytotoxicity, and cytokine signaling [89, 117, 118]. Disruption of tight junctions is associated with multiple atopic and inflammatory disease states, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease [115]. However, loss of epithelial barrier integrity is not a consistent finding across models; one 3D bronchial epithelial model (Calu-3) for silver NPs did not disrupt epithelial barriers or induce cytotoxicity [119]. These advances redefine respiratory nanotoxicology by shifting attention from isolated cytotoxic endpoints to barrier-dependent mechanisms of injury and repair. Another critical determinant of respiratory response is the pulmonary surfactant layer that lines the alveoli and airways. This lipid–protein interface governs NP dispersion, dissolution, and cellular contact, yet its influence on toxicity remains context dependent. Natural surfactant mixtures can attenuate silver NP cytotoxicity by limiting ionic release [120], whereas other formulations fail to suppress the oxidative or inflammatory effects of silver nanowires [121]. In some cases, single surfactant components such as DPPC even exacerbate oxidative stress and cytokine signaling [122]. For zinc oxide nanowires, surfactant coatings delayed early cell death but increased uptake and delayed toxicity [123]. These findings illustrate that pulmonary surfactant interactions are a key but variable modifier of NP behavior, and that faithfully incorporating the biochemical and biophysical complexity of this interface into advanced airway models remains a continuing methodological limitation in respiratory nanotoxicology. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular program in which epithelial cells lose polarity and adhesion, acquiring migratory and fibroblast-like traits central to fibrosis and remodeling. NP exposure can induce EMT through oxidative stress and DNA damage–mediated activation of the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 base-excision repair pathway [124]. Palladium NPs from catalytic converters and lead perovskite both trigger EMT in bronchial epithelial cells via TGF-β1 signaling, implicating EMT dysregulation in fibrotic and structural lung disease [55, 100]. Uncoated cerium oxide NPs, over 80% internalized by lung epithelium within 24 h, directly stimulate collagen synthesis and fibroblastic nodule formation in human lung fibroblasts-effects mitigated by silica coating as a safety-by-design measure [125, 126]. Titanium- and iron-based cosmetic aerosols deposit ultrafine particles in tracheobronchial regions, where exposure produces greater oxidative stress and accumulation of 8-oxoguanine DNA lesions than equivalent doses of pristine titanium or iron NPs [124]. Beyond epithelial effects, zinc oxide and copper oxide NPs diminish airway smooth-muscle contractility through non-ROS biomechanical mechanisms [127], suggesting a broader role of nanometal exposure in respiratory dysfunction. Considered in context, these findings indicate that NP toxicity in the respiratory tract arises less from size alone than from persistent oxidative and signaling disruptions that reprogram both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments."

Chemical transformations in air further influence toxicity: magnetite NPs coated by acidic or organic films release more soluble iron and provoke stronger oxidative and cytokine responses than uncoated forms [129]. Atmospheric processing, not only composition or size, determines biological activity. Controlled human inhalation studies define the boundary between mechanistic data and occupational exposure. Inhalation of 0.5 mg/m³ zinc oxide produced no measurable systemic or respiratory effects [130]. Subsequent work demonstrated a concentration-dependent inflammatory response across 0.5–2 mg/m³ nano-ZnO, with significant increases in neutrophils and acute-phase proteins at and above 1 mg/m³, defining the lower threshold for transient systemic effects [131]. A later comparison at 2 mg/m³ under exertion showed similar responses for nano- and micro-ZnO, with slightly higher values for the latter due to greater deposition efficiency rather than particle size toxicity [132]. Across these investigations, toxicity scaled primarily with deposited mass and ionic dissolution rather than nominal particle size. Simulations of workplace aerosols demonstrate that biologically relevant cellular doses are orders of magnitude lower than those typically applied in in vitro toxicology studies [12]. These modeling approaches define the concentration range within which experimental data can be meaningfully compared to human exposure scenarios. Field measurements complement this framework by confirming that respirable NPs are generated under ordinary use conditions. For example, commercial spray products emitting titanium dioxide can transiently exceed recommended exposure limits during brief applications [13]. Broader assessments show that indoor nanomaterial measurements often capture mixed emissions from combustion sources and process aerosols rather than the engineered product itself [14]. These findings link modeled exposure potential with real-world aerosol occurrence, showing that accurate interpretation of NP toxicity requires consideration of realistic dose levels and environmental context, as demonstrated in occupational settings such as welding and firearm exposure. While metal fume fever has been recognized for decades [133], the contribution of nano-sized particulate matter is now being described. Lung-tissue analysis of professional welders identified iron, manganese, and chromium oxide NPs within macrophages and fibrotic regions, linking chronic exposure to persistent inflammation [134]. Modeled airflow studies indicate that only about 1% of welding-fume agglomerates deposit in the olfactory mucosa, but morphology, long chains versus compact clusters, strongly influences this fraction [135]. Thus, particle geometry contributes to deposition and potential for systemic translocation. Because manganese constitutes a major component of many welding aerosols, these deposition patterns have important implications for neurotoxicity, with elevated blood manganese levels linked to basal ganglia hyperintensity on MRI and reduced working-memory performance in exposed workers even at routine exposure levels [136, 137]. Controlled exposure of apprentice welders to tungsten inert gas fumes demonstrated transient oxidative stress, with elevated hydrogen peroxide and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in plasma and urine three hours post-exposure [138]. Comparable findings in active stainless-steel welders showed chromium and nickel in exhaled breath condensate correlated with oxidative biomarkers [139]. Quantitative exposure measurements reinforce this relevance. Comparative monitoring of carbon-steel and aluminum welding revealed alveolar-deposited surface areas exceeding tens of thousands of µm²/cm³, demonstrating that even low-fume processes emit respirable ultrafine particles [140]. This is convergent evidence that welding aerosols contribute to measurable biological stress, with deposition behavior, surface area, and transition-metal content as key determinants of effect. Military facilities and indoor firing ranges generate complex aerosols composed of ultrafine metals and combustion gases. Characterization of shooting-range air shows that it contains respirable lead and antimony particles with high alveolar deposition potential [81]. Replacement of lead-based ammunition with alternative compositions reduces classical toxicants but introduces copper, zinc, manganese, and boron NPs, shifting rather than removing risk [81]. Experimental studies using collected firearm particles demonstrate oxidative stress and cytokine release in lung epithelial cultures, with highest toxicity from copper- and zinc-rich emissions [83]. ALI exposures to freshly generated firearm discharge confirm that these aerosols reduce cell viability and induce IL-8 signaling, with rifle fire producing greater effects than handguns [141]. Controlled exposures of ALI cultures to fumes from steel-core ammunition show similar findings, including genotoxicity linked to transition-metal and gas co-pollutant mixtures [82]. Human monitoring extends these observations. Repeated occupational exposure among firearm instructors is associated with oxidative-stress biomarkers and elevated urinary copper despite airborne metal levels below current limits [142]. Studies in police instructors exposed to similar ultrafine particle environments showed small, non-significant increases in inflammatory and endothelial markers, suggesting possible early biological responses that warrant continued investigation [143]. That said, while these studies suggest only mild or subclinical biological responses, the absence of pronounced nanometal toxicity should not be interpreted as evidence of safety, since firing-range personnel commonly exhibit elevated blood lead levels consistent with ongoing cumulative metal exposure [144–146]."

      "text": "What has been consistently demonstrated, across varying cell models, and organ-systems, is that the specific toxicity profile and intensity are dependent not only on the elemental composition of the NP, but also on the NP’s physicochemical characteristics. Yet, the chemical itself can be a key factor, such as when comparing the minimal inflammatory potential of barium sulfate compared to zinc oxide [99, 147]. For a given material like titanium dioxide, specific features such as primary particle size, crystal structure, and agglomeration state can significantly impact its demonstrable toxic effects [28]. It is also noteworthy that even previously considered non-toxic NPs may demonstrate toxic effect in the right circumstances: cerium(IV) oxide NPs did not exhibit any toxic effect by itself, but when zinc oxides were combined with cerium(IV) oxide, cytotoxic effects were observed, and IL-8 and ROS generation were higher when zinc oxide NPs were combined with CeO2 NPs, compared to ZnO alone [89]. The mechanism by which this potentiation of toxicity occurs in the presence of individually non-toxic cerium(IV) oxide is unclear, but may be due to changes in the oxidation state in the presence of zinc oxide [89]. These cell models underscore a critical point: the toxicity of a given NP can be significantly altered by its physicochemical state or by interactions with other metals, chemicals, or organic matter, warranting continued investigation even for materials presumed to be inert. Cell-based and in vitro models comprise the vast majority of extant literature for the toxicologic effects of metal-containing NPs in human organ systems. Any assessment of the existing body of literature must inherently acknowledge the limitations of such models to translate into clinically relevant toxicant-mediated end-organ effects or toxicant-related disease pathogenesis. For example, in vitro hemolysis induced from washed human erythrocytes exposed to titanium dioxide NPs would not imply an expectation for intravascular hemolysis in vivo among consumers exposed to TiO2 NPs from home sunscreen application given the specific limitation of the model to mimic real-world exposure conditions; i.e., the presence of human plasma which would be expected to abolish the effect [54]. Further limitations include an inconsistent cross-study model design, with some studies using an ALI to expose cells to NPs and others using a method for a submerged interface for NP exposures to cells. One ALI model using aerosol exposure chambers, which are self-contained cell culture systems that allow direct exposure to nanoparticles or other aerosols, demonstrated a greater increase in cytotoxicity and a larger reduction in cell viability for M4 rifle fumes compared to the M9 pistol, in A549 alveolar cells exposed to particulate iron-, nickel-, and copper-containing fumes generated directly from firing chambers [141]. ALI models such as this are considered superior in their ability to replicate in vitro conditions that more closely represent in vivo tissue–toxicant exposures, but reproducibility and experimental technique remain non-uniform across studies. The continued development and standardization of these models are likely to define the future of toxicologic research on nanoparticles [141]. However, the use of in vitro modelling holds advantages in allowing the elucidation of mechanistic cellular-based toxicities, and to avoid the obvious ethical quandaries of human-exposure implementation for toxicant NPs of interest. Furthermore, in vitro modelling tends to allow researchers to isolate individual NPs to identify their independent toxic profile, whereas an in vivo exposure model would tend to reflect end-organ toxicities from multiple simultaneous exposures. In a real-world occupational chemical characterization model in which shipyard abrasion and spray painting emissions were characterized for nanometal emissions (20 to 110 nm), the metal aerosol composition consisted of scandium, vanadium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rubidium, niobium, and cesium [86], and similarly, studies on consumer spray products have shown they can also be a source of exposure, generating respirable aerosols containing NPs such as titanium dioxide [13]. Upon exposure to these spray-painting aerosols, the majority composition described as copper and vanadium NPs, human alveolar cells (A549) demonstrated cytotoxicity, production of ROS, and increases in micronuclei frequency, indicating genotoxicity. Given the high prevalence of nanotechnologies in industry, commerce, and domestic use, a continued, systematic approach that couples chemical composition studies of mixed aerosol, dermal, and enteral metal-containing nanoparticle hazards with in vitro cellular analyses is essential for identifying disease states of interest and guiding future clinical research and monitoring. Where data are inconsistent in demonstrating NP-mediated tissue toxicity, such as with TiO2 inhalational exposure, it would suggest that an opportunity in future study would be for greater consistency of modelling between studies in order to enhance reproducibility of effects and instill greater confidence in interpretation of results [74, 103, 104, 113]. There is a continued need for studies in compositional analysis of environmental, occupational, and domestic exposures to NPs, especially as it is used in exposure-risk assessment models that couple with cellular toxicity modelling based on those toxicant exposures. Though certain nanometals such as silver NPs carry published recommended exposure limits from National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), other NPs with well described cellular toxicity such as zinc oxide NPs are not yet specifically addressed, and even with silver NPs, a computational fluid dynamics model of a short-term inhalation of 10 µg AgNP/m3, based on an exposure on NIOSH exposure limits for silver NPs yielded a blood-silver accumulation of 0.46 to 64 mg per year, which does exceed the lowest adverse effect level of 25 mg for an adult male [148]. In physiology based lung model using probabilistic risk assessment, the risk of titanium dioxide sprays in commercial spray sunscreen suggested that that application of sunscreen sprays poses no significant health risk; however, authors noted that sprays were only pressed twice within a certain period and that frequency of application is likely to be higher in consumer use according to guidelines on the product labels [149]. The burden and continued need for reassessment of risk will only continue to grow as these nanometals become ever more ubiquitous in daily life. Special emphasis should be made to identify readily obtainable biomarkers for significant NP, such as C-reactive protein or interferon gamma in nasal secretions, which correlate with exposure to ultrafine zinc and copper-containing welding fumes [150]. Once identified, such biomarkers could enable population-level monitoring to better correlate exposure with disease incidence. Titanium dioxide, the most widespread metal-containing nanoparticle in consumer and industrial products, exemplifies the need for accessible biomonitoring and ongoing reassessment of health risk as evidence accumulates linking epithelial barrier dysfunction to respiratory outcomes, including atopic and asthma-spectrum disease. This review has several limitations inherent to its scope and design.

Finally, given the heterogeneity of in vitro models and exposure systems, reproducibility across studies remains limited, and results should be interpreted as a conceptual evidence map rather than a quantitative synthesis."

However, a significant gap persists between these cellular findings and their translation to human health outcomes, a challenge compounded by inconsistent experimental models and the complexity of real-world, mixed-material exposures. Bridging this gap requires a continued, multi-faceted approach that integrates compositional analysis of environmental hazards with more standardized in vitro systems and the development of accessible biomarkers. Such efforts are essential for creating evidence-based risk assessments and regulatory frameworks capable of protecting public health in an era of ever-increasing NP exposure."

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nNanotechnology involves the engineering and manipulation of materials having at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers [1]. Although the scientific field of nanotechnology was formally defined in the 1980s, human exposure to naturally occurring nanoparticles (NPs) has been a constant feature of the environment [2]. In recent decades, potential human exposure to NPs is expected to rise, driven by both unintentional anthropogenic sources, such as industrial byproducts, and the increasing use of intentionally engineered nanomaterials [3, 4]. The novel physicochemical behaviors and high surface-area-to-volume ratios inherent to nanomaterials result in unique toxicological properties that are not predictable by classical pharmacokinetic and dynamic models [5]. Consequently, nanotoxicology has emerged as a sub-discipline of particle toxicology dedicated to assessing these hazards and establishing clinical principles for managing both occupational and public exposure [3, 5]. A central focus of nanotoxicology is assessing the risks from environmental and occupational sources, which represent a significant and growing public health concern [6]. Human exposure occurs through a hierarchy of routes, with the greatest potential in occupational settings where raw nanomaterials are handled, followed by consumer exposure through products like cosmetics and sprays, and finally via the general environment [7]. These particles enter the body through multiple routes, including inhalation of airborne pollutants like welding fumes and ingestion of contaminated drinking water, leading to systemic effects [8, 9]. A consensus is emerging from in vitro research that the primary mechanisms of toxicity are the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation [10]. For example, studies on human lung cells have shown that exposure to metal-containing NP mixtures from welding fumes leads to decreased cell viability, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a robust inflammatory response mediated by cytokines like IL-8 [11]. This mechanistic understanding is crucial, as the specific composition of the NPs can significantly alter the toxicological outcome, yet translating these cellular findings into clear human health risks remains a key challenge for both clinical guidance and regulatory frameworks [8]. The evolving nature of this field is reflected in a dynamic regulatory landscape, as bodies like the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) work to develop frameworks that address the unique challenges posed by nanomaterials. While numerous industrial reviews have characterized the extent of occupational exposures [4, 7], translating this hazard identification data into clinically relevant guidance requires extensive modelling [12–14]. Therefore, in vivo animal and in vitro cellular models have been essential for elucidating mechanisms of toxicity and predicting potential human health outcomes. This review examines the current scope of knowledge regarding human end-organ toxicity following exposure to metal-containing NPs. By synthesizing findings from preclinical in situ and in vitro models, we aim to provide an overview of the mechanisms and manifestations of metal-containing NP toxicity.\n\n## Methods\nTo align with the exploratory aims of this investigation, this study was conducted as a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. No previous scoping review protocol for metal-containing NPs existed. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database on August 11, 2024, using a multi-string approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of the topic. The primary search queries were inhaled metallic NPs human toxicity, inhaled zinc oxide NPs human toxicity, inhal* AND nano* AND human AND toxi* AND metal*, and inhal* AND titan* AND nano* AND human toxi*. The publication years of the screened articles ranged from 2003 to 2024, spanning the most recent two decades of available literature. The inclusion criteria were English-language articles reporting on nanomaterial exposure in human tissues (e.g., pharynx, larynx, trachea, myocardium, and thoracic lymph nodes) using either in vivo or in vitro models. The exclusion criteria were non-human studies (i.e., those conducted exclusively in animal, insect, or plant models); non-original research (e.g., reviews, editorials, letters, and updates); studies focused on therapeutic drug delivery where toxicity was not a primary outcome; and purely theoretical or risk-assessment papers that lacked experimental exposure and toxicity data. While animal models remain essential to understanding nanoparticle biodistribution and metabolism, our intended objective was to map mechanistic evidence in human tissue and derived from in vitro systems. In this review, “metal-containing NPs” is used as an umbrella term encompassing elemental forms of metals, metal oxides, metalloids, and composite forms. Within the nanotoxicology literature, metallic NPs generally refer to elemental forms such as silver or gold, while metal oxide NPs describe oxidized derivatives such as titanium dioxide or zinc oxide [15]. Metalloid NPs include elements with intermediate metallic character, such as arsenic [15]. Because many of the studies included here examine complex or mixed compositions, this broader terminology most accurately captures the materials under investigation and aligns with definitions used in recent nanotoxicology reviews [16, 17]. As reported in Fig. 1, the initial search yielded 946 articles. After removing 521 duplicates, 425 unique records remained for screening. These articles were independently evaluated by the authors based on predefined eligibility criteria. We acknowledge that some studies meeting the inclusion criteria were not ultimately represented in the narrative synthesis. As permitted within the PRISMA-ScR framework, scoping reviews emphasize conceptual mapping and may selectively highlight studies most relevant to the review objectives. Consistent with the iterative nature of scoping methodology, additional relevant papers identified during manuscript development were incorporated when they met the inclusion criteria and contributed meaningfully to the evidence map. Fig. 1Study selection process for the scoping review Study selection process for the scoping review\n\n## Results\nFrom the 425 unique articles screened, 289 were excluded for not meeting the eligibility criteria. The primary reasons for exclusion included being non-human or ecotoxicology studies (n = 114), focusing on drug-delivery (n = 6), examining NPs that did not contain metal (n = 19), being non-original research (n = 89), not being in English (n = 8), or being exposure/dosimetry studies that lacked relevant toxicological data (n = 53). This screening process resulted in a final set of 136 articles that were included in the scoping review. A heatmap summarizing the distribution of these studies across different NPs and organ systems is presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2Heatmap illustrating the distribution of studies across different nanoparticles (NPs) and organ systems. The data reveals a significant concentration of research on zinc and titanium NPs, particularly within respiratory and immunological contexts. Studies investigating broad occupational or environmental exposures with numerous nanomaterials were excluded from this depiction Heatmap illustrating the distribution of studies across different nanoparticles (NPs) and organ systems. The data reveals a significant concentration of research on zinc and titanium NPs, particularly within respiratory and immunological contexts. Studies investigating broad occupational or environmental exposures with numerous nanomaterials were excluded from this depiction Early studies established that engineered NPs can engage the immune system to produce inflammatory responses, yet even at that time researchers recognized that surface chemistry, crystal structure, and particle size strongly influenced this behavior [18]. Experiments demonstrated that exposure to metal oxides such as titanium dioxide activated macrophages and epithelial cells, leading to release of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. This response was later refined through mechanistic work showing that inflammasome activation and IL-1β release represent a central component of the innate immune reaction [19, 20]. Upstream signaling studies demonstrated that NP exposure can induce oxidative stress mediators such as macrophage migration-inhibitory factor and amplify cytokine release through interactions with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, indicating that immune modulation occurs both before and after inflammasome activation [21, 22]. Even when overt cytotoxicity or inflammation are absent, suppression of immune signaling and impairment of host defense can still occur, highlighting a parallel mechanism of risk [23]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that metal-containing NPs can induce persistent immune modulation across multiple regulatory levels, with short exposures altering methylation and transcription of immune-related genes and corresponding human data showing long non-coding RNA shifts linked to IL-6 and cardiovascular inflammation, while copper oxide exposure produced oxidative and mitochondrial injury in lymphocytes consistent with these transcriptional effects [24–26]. Transcriptomic profiling in bronchial epithelia from asthmatic and healthy donors further revealed that copper oxide NPs elicit stronger IL-6 and IL-8 signaling and altered ciliary and metallothionein gene expression in asthmatic airways, underscoring how disease state and surface chemistry together modulate immune sensitivity [27]. Crystalline form further shapes the magnitude and nature of immune activation. Titanium dioxide commonly occurs as anatase or rutile, and these phases differ in surface energy, photocatalytic activity, and redox potential. Anatase typically exhibits stronger oxidative and inflammatory activity, whereas rutile tends to produce weaker but composition-dependent responses [18]. These distinctions were quantified through systematic variation of particle characteristics showing that IL-1β release is governed by size, shape, and crystal phase through a shared oxidative and lysosomal mechanism [28]. Later work extended this to endothelial and monocyte adhesion models, demonstrating that mixed anatase–rutile formulations differentially regulate receptor expression and inflammatory signaling [29]. Ultimately, the relationship between particle architecture and dissolution behavior has been crucial to understanding immune responses. Agglomeration state affects macrophage uptake and cytokine production, with larger aggregates of titanium dioxide provoking stronger IL-1β and IL-8 release despite identical chemical composition [30]. Moreover, poorly dissolved NPs can induce membrane disruption and cytotoxicity even when ionic release is minimal, underscoring that dissolution kinetics alone do not determine toxicity [31]. Collectively, these findings indicate that NP–immune interactions are dictated by a combination of surface reactivity, crystalline structure, aggregation, and persistence rather than by particle size or composition alone. NP interaction with the gastrointestinal barrier is a dynamic process defined less by passive diffusion and more by physicochemical transformation [30, 32, 33]. Studies of oral and intestinal epithelia show that particle size, surface charge, and agglomeration determine whether nanomaterials remain confined to mucus layers or traverse into the subepithelial compartment [32, 33]. Dissolution begins at this interface, where metal oxides such as zinc and copper release ions, while more inert materials such as titanium largely maintain particulate form [34–36]. This early dissolution alters aggregation and membrane affinity, reshaping exposure chemistry before systemic entry [30, 34, 35]. The resulting translocation is not governed by size alone but by the balance between particle stability and solubility, with loosely bound or partially dissolved species entering circulation more readily than intact aggregates [33–35]. Within this framework, epithelial toxicity involving tight junction disruption, redox imbalance, and limited inflammatory signaling reflects not a single mechanism but the composite outcome of dissolution kinetics and surface reactivity [30, 35, 37]. Once systemically distributed, these same dissolution dynamics define the hepatic response [36, 38–40]. The liver receives NPs both as intact aggregates and as dissolved metal ions, and distinguishing between these forms is central to interpreting toxicological outcomes [39, 41]. Across zinc, copper, cobalt, and lead oxides, hepatocellular injury consistently aligns with oxidative stress secondary to ionic release rather than unique nanoscale effects [36, 39, 40]. That said, while most evidence links gastrointestinal toxicity to dissolution and ionic activity, some findings indicate that particulate mechanisms can contribute independently; in a comparative study of aluminum-based nanomaterials, minimal ionic release did not prevent the induction of oxidative DNA lesions in intestinal cells, while ionic aluminum salts produced no comparable damage [42]. Intracellular dissolution, sometimes accelerated by acidic lysosomal conditions, can amplify this effect, producing a “Trojan horse” scenario in which nominally insoluble particles deliver concentrated bursts of bioavailable metal within hepatocytes [36, 39]. This intracellular release disrupts mitochondrial potential, disturbs ATP balance, and activates gluconeogenic and lipid-handling pathways that resemble early steatosis or metabolic injury [36, 39, 40]. The resulting oxidative and metabolic stress profile blurs the distinction between NP and heavy-metal toxicity, emphasizing that for many oxides, hepatotoxicity is chemically rather than structurally mediated [39–41]. Viewed together, the data converge on dissolution as the mechanistic bridge between local epithelial disruption and systemic metabolic toxicity [34–36, 39]. Particle integrity determines exposure site, but solubility determines biological consequence [30, 36]. NPs that remain stable, such as titanium dioxide, tend to accumulate with limited acute cytotoxicity [30, 32, 43], while those prone to ion release provoke oxidative and metabolic stress across tissues [34, 35, 39, 40]. The central challenge for future research lies in separating the genuinely nano-enabled behaviors, such as intracellular transport, compartmentalized dissolution, and prolonged retention, from effects explainable by classical metal toxicity [36, 38, 39]. The skin serves as both a physical barrier and a potential portal for NP interaction in occupational and consumer contexts. Early studies using keratinocyte monolayers showed that titanium dioxide NPs induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and oxidative DNA lesions, including micronucleus formation, without marked cytotoxicity or loss of proliferation [44, 45]. Subsequent work with copper oxide reported similar oxidative stress responses but with stronger reductions in cell viability, likely related to copper ion dissolution [46]. Studies of zinc oxide further refined this model by demonstrating that stress responses extend beyond ROS generation, encompassing transcriptional activation of metallothioneins, heat shock proteins, and DNA-damage–response genes in both keratinocytes and melanocytes [34]. Collectively, these findings reflect a progression from descriptive toxicity toward a mechanistic understanding centered on oxidative and stress-signaling pathways as the primary mediators of cutaneous NP responses. Three-dimensional reconstructed epidermal models show that materials cytotoxic in submerged monolayer cultures, including degraded graphene–manganese oxide composites, do not trigger significant irritation when the epidermal barrier is preserved [37]. These studies suggest that while oxidative stress is a common mechanistic endpoint across NP types, the intact stratum corneum effectively mitigates biological impact, emphasizing the importance of exposure context in dermal risk evaluation. Inhalation and deposition studies together demonstrate that metal-containing NPs can directly compromise cardiac structure and function through oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms. Autopsy findings of iron-rich NPs embedded within myocardial mitochondria revealed mitochondrial deformation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and elevated oxidative markers consistent with Fenton-type reactivity [47]. These pathological observations are reinforced by occupational data linking exposure to metal fume PM2.5 with systemic oxidative biomarkers in welders and by 3D vascularized models that replicate NP-induced endothelial permeability and vasoconstriction through NF-κB activation and calcium signaling [48, 49]. These findings establish a translational sequence from environmental exposure and biomarker correlation to controlled mechanistic modeling and histopathological confirmation, indicating that oxidative stress is a central mediator of NP cardiotoxicity. A parallel line of evidence implicates the vascular and hematologic systems as downstream targets of metal NP exposure. Complex firearms-derived aerosols containing mixed metal oxides (copper, zinc, and tin) provoke endothelial cytokine release and platelet activation, producing a prothrombotic profile even in the absence of ROS intermediates [50]. Complementary mechanistic models show that copper and zinc oxide NPs induce oxidative DNA damage, apoptosis, and dysregulation of vasoactive signaling, while cerium oxide produces minimal response, underscoring the role of composition and solubility in vascular risk [51–53]. Under physiological conditions, titanium dioxide NPs cause erythrocyte lysis only in serum-free systems, an effect neutralized by trace plasma proteins [54]. Palladium NPs tested in parallel airway, endothelial, and whole-blood models induce apoptosis, platelet consumption, and thrombin generation through kallikrein–kinin activation, despite weak surface-driven FXII autoactivation [55]. These data suggest a shifting emphasis from direct hemolysis to thrombo-inflammatory mechanisms as the predominant cardiovascular risk pathway for metal-based nanomaterials. Evidence from human and experimental studies indicates that metal-containing NPs can penetrate and interact with neural tissue, although the extent and character of the resulting toxicity vary according to particle composition, physicochemical properties, and biological context [56]. Autopsy investigations of young urban residents have revealed iron-, aluminum-, and titanium-rich NPs within the brainstem, including the substantia nigra, where they were co-localized with neuropathological markers of neurodegenerative disease such as hyperphosphorylated tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 [56]. Morphological assessment distinguished elongated titanium clusters (9 to 60 nm) associated with neuroenteric deposition from larger, spherical titanium dioxide particles typical of food sources (30 to 410 nm), suggesting distinct exposure routes: axonal transport for titanium and inhalation for aluminum and iron aggregates [56]. Though one study, it offers support for a model in which chronic environmental exposure to metal-containing NPs may catalyze protein misfolding and aggregation, promoting neurodegenerative pathology [56]. Experimental data from non-human neuronal systems provide complementary mechanistic evidence. While rodent-derived cell lines have shown that titanium dioxide NPs trigger oxidative stress–mediated apoptosis [57], findings in human-derived models are more variable. Comparative work across human lung, liver, glial, and neuronal cell lines has demonstrated robust NP internalization without corresponding increases in micronucleus formation or cytotoxicity, a finding attributed to the dynamic balance between endocytosis and exocytosis that modulates intracellular accumulation and may underlie the attenuated responses observed relative to animal models [43]. Further evidence from human neuronal and glial cultures exposed to cerium oxide NPs indicates minimal cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, even after extended exposures, consistent with the relatively low neurotoxicity observed in vivo and the proposed redox-stabilizing behavior of nanoceria [58]. Collectively, the literature delineates a gradient of neurotoxic response in which animal and non-human models consistently exhibit oxidative and apoptotic effects following exposure to metal-containing NPs, whereas human-derived systems display attenuated or variable outcomes. This divergence likely reflects species-specific differences in uptake dynamics, repair capacity, and NP persistence, underscoring the need for approaches that clarify the human relevance of NP-induced neurotoxicity. A study examining placental tissue from mothers with environmental air pollution exposure identified exogenous, carbonaceous NPs within tissue-resident phagocytic cells. Using magnetic analyses and electron microscopy, researchers confirmed these NPs were iron-rich, co-associated with other trace metals, and morphologically consistent with combustion- and friction-derived pollutants. This establishes that inhaled NPs can translocate systemically, cross into the placenta, and be taken up by placental cells, potentiating a direct pathway for fetal exposure to environmental and potentially occupational NPs [59]. Research on NP genotoxicity has progressed from descriptive demonstrations of DNA damage toward mechanistic and methodological refinement. Early human studies showed that sub-cytotoxic exposures could yield persistent genomic injury, with zinc oxide causing cumulative DNA fragmentation without apoptosis and titanium dioxide producing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and micronuclei formation, together implicating oxidative stress and inefficient DNA repair as key determinants of NP-induced genotoxicity [60, 61]. Later barrier-specific work revealed that different cell types vary in susceptibility: endothelial and macrophage-like cells displayed DNA damage and checkpoint activation, while A549 remained comparatively resistant, and altering glutathione content modulated outcomes [43, 62]. Additional studies expanded mechanistic understanding. Titanium-induced mucin and Toll-like receptor signaling clarified inflammatory pathways but contributed little to DNA-damage mechanisms [63], while comparative analyses of silver, gold, and platinum metallic NPs confirmed that silver remains uniquely genotoxic across particle sizes, reflecting dissolution-driven reactivity rather than size dependence [64]. In sums, these studies established that genotoxic potential depends not only on material reactivity but also on the antioxidant and repair capacities of individual cell types. Subsequent research shifted attention from simple strand-break detection to the cellular machinery governing persistence of damage. Titanium dioxide NPs were found to suppress both base- and nucleotide-excision repair activities and down-regulate multiple repair genes through promoter hypermethylation, linking exposure to transcriptional and epigenetic repression of repair capacity [65]. Epigenomic profiling extended this concept: short, non-cytotoxic exposures to various engineered nanomaterials altered DNA methylation of repetitive elements and decreased expression of DNA-methylation enzymes, suggesting that epigenetic drift could prolong genomic instability even after the exposure period ended [24, 42]. Zinc oxide exposure elicited pronounced oxidative and apoptotic signaling without activating key DNA repair pathways, and similar transcriptional profiling of cobalt and cerium oxide NPs showed that such stress responses vary by cell type, with stronger inflammatory signaling observed in macrophages, in contrast to the weaker oxidative activation seen in epithelial cells, indicating that NP-induced cellular stress often occurs without effective engagement of DNA repair mechanisms [34, 66, 67]. Parallel to mechanistic advances, modeling approaches for assessing NP genotoxicity underwent significant revision. The emergence of air–liquid interface (ALI) culture systems revealed that apparent DNA and cytotoxic damage often decreased under realistic aerosol deposition compared to submerged monolayers. Early ALI work showed negligible silver-NP cytotoxicity or inflammation at surface doses consistent with human exposure, challenging the reliability of conventional in vitro estimates [68, 69]; subsequent comparisons confirmed that once dosimetry and agglomeration were controlled, these systems yielded weaker acute responses than submerged cultures [70]. Multi-material testing in 3D bronchial tissue models further emphasized that genotoxicity largely tracked with the chemistry and solubility of the core material rather than particle size or coating. Only zinc oxide, citrate-stabilized silver, and a few silicon or zirconium oxides produced measurable DNA damage, while inert oxides were negative at comparable uptake fractions, and complementary airway co-culture models using human-relevant dosimetry showed similarly conservative outcomes, indicating that realistic tissue barriers substantially attenuate both genotoxic and inflammatory responses observed in simpler systems [71, 72]. Methodological realism continued to advance. Primary small-airway epithelium at the ALI exhibited transcriptomic and microRNA signatures of oxidative and genotoxic stress that paralleled in vivo inhalation findings, demonstrating that such barrier-competent systems can capture molecular responses at low, non-lethal doses [73]. Interlaboratory assessments later cautioned, however, that reproducibility of ALI endpoints remains variable and that even advanced 3-D constructs may miss subtle genotoxic effects at realistic exposures [74]. These investigations show that NP genotoxicity cannot be reduced to a single determinant: oxidative stress, deficient repair activation, and epigenetic dysregulation all contribute, while improved modeling has tempered apparent hazard by introducing realistic deposition and tissue barriers. The evolution from descriptive findings to mechanistic clarity is well illustrated by the research trajectory of cobalt NPs. Early studies demonstrated that cobalt-containing particulates could damage DNA in human cells [75–77]. These reports showed that cobalt metal, cobalt–tungsten carbide, and cobalt chloride caused DNA strand breaks and inhibited repair in isolated human lymphocytes, and later work extended these findings to nanoscale cobalt systems where oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities were observed in human bronchial and leukocyte models [76, 77]. Although methodologically limited, this early work introduced the concept that cobalt particulates in nanoscale form possess intrinsic genotoxic potential through oxidative and repair-interfering mechanisms rather than through overt cytotoxicity alone. Subsequent research refined these observations into a mechanistic framework focused on cobalt oxides, particularly Co₃O₄ [40, 78, 79]. These cobalt oxide NPs were shown to elicit both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human hepatocellular and respiratory models, with oxidative stress as a unifying mediator and minimal contribution from ionic cobalt [40, 79]. Across these studies, cobalt oxides produced little overt cytotoxicity but clear oxidative and genotoxic effects consistent with a “Trojan horse” mechanism in which intracellular particle uptake and localized dissolution generate reactive cobalt ions that damage DNA [78, 79]. Under sub-cytotoxic conditions, single-strand DNA breaks were observed in bronchial epithelial cells, implicating ROS as the direct driver of genotoxicity [78]. Collectively, this phase of research marked a shift from describing cobalt-induced DNA damage to explaining how physicochemical properties, especially solubility and intracellular dissolution, determine the balance between cytotoxic and genotoxic outcomes. A clear inflection point in this trajectory was reached when standardized comparative testing showed that cobalt metal and cobalt(II) oxide NPs exhibited marked oxidative and genotoxic activity in human lung epithelial cells, whereas cobalt(II, III) oxide, although efficiently internalized, produced negligible oxidative stress or DNA damage [80]. This clarified that low solubility can limit cobalt ion release sufficiently to suppress observable biological reactivity. This progression redefined cobalt nanotoxicology from a descriptive field identifying genotoxic hazards to a mechanistic discipline capable of distinguishing when and why cobalt oxide NPs cause oxidative DNA injury despite minimal cytotoxicity. The uptake of aerosolized nanometals in industry, commercial or home products is expected to occur via nasal or oral inhalation, as one of the earliest and most relevant routes of exposure in occupational and environmental toxicology. The majority of cell-based modelling of respiratory-related nanometal effects has focused on toxicant-mediated pathogenic effects of intranasal, buccal, bronchial, tracheal, and alveolar epithelial cells. Chemical composition analyses of occupational or environmental exposures, such as welding fumes, firearm fumes or other ballistic aerosols, often identify a range of chemical and metal constituents for study [50, 81–84]. Studies have demonstrated titanium and iron NPs in coal fly ash, and, in firearm fumes, aluminum, antimony, barium, calcium, copper, iron, potassium, lead, sulfur, sodium, strontium, tin, zinc, tungsten, nickel, iron, and cobalt [85]. Welding fumes produce a mixture of iron, manganese, nickel, chromium, scandium, vanadium, cobalt, copper, rubidium, niobium, and cesium, and indoor combustion sources such as incense and mosquito coils produce cadmium NPs [86–88]. Welding fumes containing iron and manganese NPs elicit strong cytokine signaling in respiratory epithelia, particularly via IL-8, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, and HO-1, with IL-8 often predominating; comparable IL-8 upregulation occurs with zinc oxide and related metal oxide NPs through NFκB- and C/EBPβ-dependent transcription and mRNA stabilization mechanisms, and concurrent induction of HO-1 and metallothionein serves as a general marker of metal-oxide cytotoxicity [11, 89–91]. Taken together, these models suggest a risk for carcinogenicity, epithelial toxicity, and cytotoxicity. Common findings among respiratory epithelial cell models show that metal-containing NPs, to varying extents depending on their composition, generate ROS and cause cytotoxicity, with the greatest effects observed for zinc, copper, and nickel oxides [91, 92]. Zinc oxide NPs have demonstrated altered gene expression of immune cells, induction of ROS, increased cytokine signaling and cytotoxicity [89, 93–95]. Implicated mechanisms for zinc oxide cytotoxicity are related to intracellular dissolution, which leads to zinc ion homeostatic disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis [96]; other mechanisms are mitochondrial inhibition of complex I and II, altered mitochondrial fission and fusion protein expression, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by ROS and NF-kb, and interactions with lung surfactant components like dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which increases the membrane damage caused by zinc oxide NPs [93–98]. Induction of ROS and cytotoxicity has been similarly demonstrated in bronchial epithelial and alveolar cell modeling of titanium dioxide, gold, palladium, lead halide perovskite, iron, and manganese [11, 30, 37, 55, 93–95, 99, 100]. Induction of apoptosis in alveolar cells is demonstratable with model exposures to zinc, nickel, and tungsten carbide cobalt NPs [92, 101, 102]. Titanium dioxide is present as a ubiquitous whitening pigment and is widely used in catalytic and photocatalytic applications such as water and air filtration and self-cleaning surfaces. Models of respiratory toxicity from titanium dioxide have been conflicting, with several studies failing to demonstrate cytotoxicity or micronuclei genotoxicity markers at varying concentrations and in various cells lines [43, 74, 103, 104]. However, titanium dioxide exposed alveolar and bronchial models have shown altered expression of histone deacetylase 9, which is an epigenetic modifier, and that production of ROS, cytotoxicity, glutathione production, and DNA double strand breaks are influenced by titanium dioxide agglomeration, the presence of a more toxic nanofiber rather than nanoparticle, or the predominance of the anatase or rutile structure [30, 99, 105–107]. Interactions with the pulmonary surfactant is a critical factor, as components like DPPC have been shown to coat silver nanoparticles, improving their dispersion and delaying the release of toxic ions [108]. Shotgun proteomics, a high-throughput mass-spectrometry technique that identifies and quantifies proteins from complex mixtures, have identified one underlying mechanism as the dysregulation of protein phosphorylation sites, with subsequent impact on DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, autophagy and cytoskeletal structure and dynamics, cellular transport, RNA dynamics, with a central role of p53 [65]. Epithelial barrier integrity, as in studies of genotoxicity, represents a central determinant of NP behavior in vitro, shaping both apparent toxicity and the way experimental results are extrapolated to human risk. Barrier status influences not only particle uptake and translocation but also the interpretation of downstream effects such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell viability. Modern respiratory models increasingly emphasize this point through advanced in vitro systems that recapitulate the ALI, allowing aerosolized nanometal exposures to occur under physiologically relevant conditions [74, 109–111]. These systems demonstrate that deposition dynamics, dissolution, and ionic transformation vary substantially from submerged monolayer cultures, leading to lower apparent toxicity at realistic doses. Methodological refinements, including electrostatic deposition, dynamic flow exposure, and barrier maturation protocols, have enabled closer approximation to in vivo airway deposition while highlighting the role of serum and protein coronas in modulating NP reactivity [112, 113]. Multiparametric approaches have further clarified that protein adsorption and cytokine binding can confound apparent inflammatory outcomes in submerged assays, reinforcing the need for integrated evaluation of intracellular, secreted, and transcriptional endpoints [114]. Collectively, these studies mark a shift from simplified cytotoxicity assays toward barrier-competent reagents that can distinguish direct nanomaterial effects from secondary phenomena related to barrier disruption or ion-mediated stress. With these modeling advances established, current research has turned toward the consequences of barrier loss itself, examining how disruption of tight and adherens junctions alters respiratory permeability and permits NP translocation into systemic circulation and target organs. Loss of barrier integrity in this manners, independent of cytotoxicity and altered gene expression, has been demonstrated with silver and tungsten NPs as well as titanium dioxide [103, 115, 116]. Notably, the loss of cell membrane integrity induced by nano zero-valent iron and zinc oxide NPs occurs via inflammatory responses in endothelial cells and is concurrent with production of ROS, cytotoxicity, and cytokine signaling [89, 117, 118]. Disruption of tight junctions is associated with multiple atopic and inflammatory disease states, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease [115]. However, loss of epithelial barrier integrity is not a consistent finding across models; one 3D bronchial epithelial model (Calu-3) for silver NPs did not disrupt epithelial barriers or induce cytotoxicity [119]. These advances redefine respiratory nanotoxicology by shifting attention from isolated cytotoxic endpoints to barrier-dependent mechanisms of injury and repair. Another critical determinant of respiratory response is the pulmonary surfactant layer that lines the alveoli and airways. This lipid–protein interface governs NP dispersion, dissolution, and cellular contact, yet its influence on toxicity remains context dependent. Natural surfactant mixtures can attenuate silver NP cytotoxicity by limiting ionic release [120], whereas other formulations fail to suppress the oxidative or inflammatory effects of silver nanowires [121]. In some cases, single surfactant components such as DPPC even exacerbate oxidative stress and cytokine signaling [122]. For zinc oxide nanowires, surfactant coatings delayed early cell death but increased uptake and delayed toxicity [123]. These findings illustrate that pulmonary surfactant interactions are a key but variable modifier of NP behavior, and that faithfully incorporating the biochemical and biophysical complexity of this interface into advanced airway models remains a continuing methodological limitation in respiratory nanotoxicology. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular program in which epithelial cells lose polarity and adhesion, acquiring migratory and fibroblast-like traits central to fibrosis and remodeling. NP exposure can induce EMT through oxidative stress and DNA damage–mediated activation of the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 base-excision repair pathway [124]. Palladium NPs from catalytic converters and lead perovskite both trigger EMT in bronchial epithelial cells via TGF-β1 signaling, implicating EMT dysregulation in fibrotic and structural lung disease [55, 100]. Uncoated cerium oxide NPs, over 80% internalized by lung epithelium within 24 h, directly stimulate collagen synthesis and fibroblastic nodule formation in human lung fibroblasts-effects mitigated by silica coating as a safety-by-design measure [125, 126]. Titanium- and iron-based cosmetic aerosols deposit ultrafine particles in tracheobronchial regions, where exposure produces greater oxidative stress and accumulation of 8-oxoguanine DNA lesions than equivalent doses of pristine titanium or iron NPs [124]. Beyond epithelial effects, zinc oxide and copper oxide NPs diminish airway smooth-muscle contractility through non-ROS biomechanical mechanisms [127], suggesting a broader role of nanometal exposure in respiratory dysfunction. Considered in context, these findings indicate that NP toxicity in the respiratory tract arises less from size alone than from persistent oxidative and signaling disruptions that reprogram both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments. Understanding NP toxicity requires accounting for the exposure phase, particle chemistry, and realistic dosing. As previously discussed, most in vitro studies utilize submerged cell cultures; however, these systems do not entirely replicate the manner in which aerosols interact with airway surfaces. Comparisons under equivalent mass doses show that zinc oxide NPs delivered as aerosols produce earlier oxidative and inflammatory responses than suspensions, with peak effects at four hours instead of twenty-four, but the total response magnitude later converges, indicating that liquid systems delay but do not prevent cellular injury [128]. Chemical transformations in air further influence toxicity: magnetite NPs coated by acidic or organic films release more soluble iron and provoke stronger oxidative and cytokine responses than uncoated forms [129]. Atmospheric processing, not only composition or size, determines biological activity. Controlled human inhalation studies define the boundary between mechanistic data and occupational exposure. Inhalation of 0.5 mg/m³ zinc oxide produced no measurable systemic or respiratory effects [130]. Subsequent work demonstrated a concentration-dependent inflammatory response across 0.5–2 mg/m³ nano-ZnO, with significant increases in neutrophils and acute-phase proteins at and above 1 mg/m³, defining the lower threshold for transient systemic effects [131]. A later comparison at 2 mg/m³ under exertion showed similar responses for nano- and micro-ZnO, with slightly higher values for the latter due to greater deposition efficiency rather than particle size toxicity [132]. Across these investigations, toxicity scaled primarily with deposited mass and ionic dissolution rather than nominal particle size. Simulations of workplace aerosols demonstrate that biologically relevant cellular doses are orders of magnitude lower than those typically applied in in vitro toxicology studies [12]. These modeling approaches define the concentration range within which experimental data can be meaningfully compared to human exposure scenarios. Field measurements complement this framework by confirming that respirable NPs are generated under ordinary use conditions. For example, commercial spray products emitting titanium dioxide can transiently exceed recommended exposure limits during brief applications [13]. Broader assessments show that indoor nanomaterial measurements often capture mixed emissions from combustion sources and process aerosols rather than the engineered product itself [14]. These findings link modeled exposure potential with real-world aerosol occurrence, showing that accurate interpretation of NP toxicity requires consideration of realistic dose levels and environmental context, as demonstrated in occupational settings such as welding and firearm exposure. While metal fume fever has been recognized for decades [133], the contribution of nano-sized particulate matter is now being described. Lung-tissue analysis of professional welders identified iron, manganese, and chromium oxide NPs within macrophages and fibrotic regions, linking chronic exposure to persistent inflammation [134]. Modeled airflow studies indicate that only about 1% of welding-fume agglomerates deposit in the olfactory mucosa, but morphology, long chains versus compact clusters, strongly influences this fraction [135]. Thus, particle geometry contributes to deposition and potential for systemic translocation. Because manganese constitutes a major component of many welding aerosols, these deposition patterns have important implications for neurotoxicity, with elevated blood manganese levels linked to basal ganglia hyperintensity on MRI and reduced working-memory performance in exposed workers even at routine exposure levels [136, 137]. Controlled exposure of apprentice welders to tungsten inert gas fumes demonstrated transient oxidative stress, with elevated hydrogen peroxide and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in plasma and urine three hours post-exposure [138]. Comparable findings in active stainless-steel welders showed chromium and nickel in exhaled breath condensate correlated with oxidative biomarkers [139]. Quantitative exposure measurements reinforce this relevance. Comparative monitoring of carbon-steel and aluminum welding revealed alveolar-deposited surface areas exceeding tens of thousands of µm²/cm³, demonstrating that even low-fume processes emit respirable ultrafine particles [140]. This is convergent evidence that welding aerosols contribute to measurable biological stress, with deposition behavior, surface area, and transition-metal content as key determinants of effect. Military facilities and indoor firing ranges generate complex aerosols composed of ultrafine metals and combustion gases. Characterization of shooting-range air shows that it contains respirable lead and antimony particles with high alveolar deposition potential [81]. Replacement of lead-based ammunition with alternative compositions reduces classical toxicants but introduces copper, zinc, manganese, and boron NPs, shifting rather than removing risk [81]. Experimental studies using collected firearm particles demonstrate oxidative stress and cytokine release in lung epithelial cultures, with highest toxicity from copper- and zinc-rich emissions [83]. ALI exposures to freshly generated firearm discharge confirm that these aerosols reduce cell viability and induce IL-8 signaling, with rifle fire producing greater effects than handguns [141]. Controlled exposures of ALI cultures to fumes from steel-core ammunition show similar findings, including genotoxicity linked to transition-metal and gas co-pollutant mixtures [82]. Human monitoring extends these observations. Repeated occupational exposure among firearm instructors is associated with oxidative-stress biomarkers and elevated urinary copper despite airborne metal levels below current limits [142]. Studies in police instructors exposed to similar ultrafine particle environments showed small, non-significant increases in inflammatory and endothelial markers, suggesting possible early biological responses that warrant continued investigation [143]. That said, while these studies suggest only mild or subclinical biological responses, the absence of pronounced nanometal toxicity should not be interpreted as evidence of safety, since firing-range personnel commonly exhibit elevated blood lead levels consistent with ongoing cumulative metal exposure [144–146].\n\n## Immune system\nEarly studies established that engineered NPs can engage the immune system to produce inflammatory responses, yet even at that time researchers recognized that surface chemistry, crystal structure, and particle size strongly influenced this behavior [18]. Experiments demonstrated that exposure to metal oxides such as titanium dioxide activated macrophages and epithelial cells, leading to release of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. This response was later refined through mechanistic work showing that inflammasome activation and IL-1β release represent a central component of the innate immune reaction [19, 20]. Upstream signaling studies demonstrated that NP exposure can induce oxidative stress mediators such as macrophage migration-inhibitory factor and amplify cytokine release through interactions with pathogen-associated molecular patterns, indicating that immune modulation occurs both before and after inflammasome activation [21, 22]. Even when overt cytotoxicity or inflammation are absent, suppression of immune signaling and impairment of host defense can still occur, highlighting a parallel mechanism of risk [23]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that metal-containing NPs can induce persistent immune modulation across multiple regulatory levels, with short exposures altering methylation and transcription of immune-related genes and corresponding human data showing long non-coding RNA shifts linked to IL-6 and cardiovascular inflammation, while copper oxide exposure produced oxidative and mitochondrial injury in lymphocytes consistent with these transcriptional effects [24–26]. Transcriptomic profiling in bronchial epithelia from asthmatic and healthy donors further revealed that copper oxide NPs elicit stronger IL-6 and IL-8 signaling and altered ciliary and metallothionein gene expression in asthmatic airways, underscoring how disease state and surface chemistry together modulate immune sensitivity [27]. Crystalline form further shapes the magnitude and nature of immune activation. Titanium dioxide commonly occurs as anatase or rutile, and these phases differ in surface energy, photocatalytic activity, and redox potential. Anatase typically exhibits stronger oxidative and inflammatory activity, whereas rutile tends to produce weaker but composition-dependent responses [18]. These distinctions were quantified through systematic variation of particle characteristics showing that IL-1β release is governed by size, shape, and crystal phase through a shared oxidative and lysosomal mechanism [28]. Later work extended this to endothelial and monocyte adhesion models, demonstrating that mixed anatase–rutile formulations differentially regulate receptor expression and inflammatory signaling [29]. Ultimately, the relationship between particle architecture and dissolution behavior has been crucial to understanding immune responses. Agglomeration state affects macrophage uptake and cytokine production, with larger aggregates of titanium dioxide provoking stronger IL-1β and IL-8 release despite identical chemical composition [30]. Moreover, poorly dissolved NPs can induce membrane disruption and cytotoxicity even when ionic release is minimal, underscoring that dissolution kinetics alone do not determine toxicity [31]. Collectively, these findings indicate that NP–immune interactions are dictated by a combination of surface reactivity, crystalline structure, aggregation, and persistence rather than by particle size or composition alone.\n\n## Gastrointestinal system\nNP interaction with the gastrointestinal barrier is a dynamic process defined less by passive diffusion and more by physicochemical transformation [30, 32, 33]. Studies of oral and intestinal epithelia show that particle size, surface charge, and agglomeration determine whether nanomaterials remain confined to mucus layers or traverse into the subepithelial compartment [32, 33]. Dissolution begins at this interface, where metal oxides such as zinc and copper release ions, while more inert materials such as titanium largely maintain particulate form [34–36]. This early dissolution alters aggregation and membrane affinity, reshaping exposure chemistry before systemic entry [30, 34, 35]. The resulting translocation is not governed by size alone but by the balance between particle stability and solubility, with loosely bound or partially dissolved species entering circulation more readily than intact aggregates [33–35]. Within this framework, epithelial toxicity involving tight junction disruption, redox imbalance, and limited inflammatory signaling reflects not a single mechanism but the composite outcome of dissolution kinetics and surface reactivity [30, 35, 37]. Once systemically distributed, these same dissolution dynamics define the hepatic response [36, 38–40]. The liver receives NPs both as intact aggregates and as dissolved metal ions, and distinguishing between these forms is central to interpreting toxicological outcomes [39, 41]. Across zinc, copper, cobalt, and lead oxides, hepatocellular injury consistently aligns with oxidative stress secondary to ionic release rather than unique nanoscale effects [36, 39, 40]. That said, while most evidence links gastrointestinal toxicity to dissolution and ionic activity, some findings indicate that particulate mechanisms can contribute independently; in a comparative study of aluminum-based nanomaterials, minimal ionic release did not prevent the induction of oxidative DNA lesions in intestinal cells, while ionic aluminum salts produced no comparable damage [42]. Intracellular dissolution, sometimes accelerated by acidic lysosomal conditions, can amplify this effect, producing a “Trojan horse” scenario in which nominally insoluble particles deliver concentrated bursts of bioavailable metal within hepatocytes [36, 39]. This intracellular release disrupts mitochondrial potential, disturbs ATP balance, and activates gluconeogenic and lipid-handling pathways that resemble early steatosis or metabolic injury [36, 39, 40]. The resulting oxidative and metabolic stress profile blurs the distinction between NP and heavy-metal toxicity, emphasizing that for many oxides, hepatotoxicity is chemically rather than structurally mediated [39–41]. Viewed together, the data converge on dissolution as the mechanistic bridge between local epithelial disruption and systemic metabolic toxicity [34–36, 39]. Particle integrity determines exposure site, but solubility determines biological consequence [30, 36]. NPs that remain stable, such as titanium dioxide, tend to accumulate with limited acute cytotoxicity [30, 32, 43], while those prone to ion release provoke oxidative and metabolic stress across tissues [34, 35, 39, 40]. The central challenge for future research lies in separating the genuinely nano-enabled behaviors, such as intracellular transport, compartmentalized dissolution, and prolonged retention, from effects explainable by classical metal toxicity [36, 38, 39].\n\n## Integumentary system\nThe skin serves as both a physical barrier and a potential portal for NP interaction in occupational and consumer contexts. Early studies using keratinocyte monolayers showed that titanium dioxide NPs induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and oxidative DNA lesions, including micronucleus formation, without marked cytotoxicity or loss of proliferation [44, 45]. Subsequent work with copper oxide reported similar oxidative stress responses but with stronger reductions in cell viability, likely related to copper ion dissolution [46]. Studies of zinc oxide further refined this model by demonstrating that stress responses extend beyond ROS generation, encompassing transcriptional activation of metallothioneins, heat shock proteins, and DNA-damage–response genes in both keratinocytes and melanocytes [34]. Collectively, these findings reflect a progression from descriptive toxicity toward a mechanistic understanding centered on oxidative and stress-signaling pathways as the primary mediators of cutaneous NP responses. Three-dimensional reconstructed epidermal models show that materials cytotoxic in submerged monolayer cultures, including degraded graphene–manganese oxide composites, do not trigger significant irritation when the epidermal barrier is preserved [37]. These studies suggest that while oxidative stress is a common mechanistic endpoint across NP types, the intact stratum corneum effectively mitigates biological impact, emphasizing the importance of exposure context in dermal risk evaluation.\n\n## Cardiovascular system\nInhalation and deposition studies together demonstrate that metal-containing NPs can directly compromise cardiac structure and function through oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms. Autopsy findings of iron-rich NPs embedded within myocardial mitochondria revealed mitochondrial deformation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and elevated oxidative markers consistent with Fenton-type reactivity [47]. These pathological observations are reinforced by occupational data linking exposure to metal fume PM2.5 with systemic oxidative biomarkers in welders and by 3D vascularized models that replicate NP-induced endothelial permeability and vasoconstriction through NF-κB activation and calcium signaling [48, 49]. These findings establish a translational sequence from environmental exposure and biomarker correlation to controlled mechanistic modeling and histopathological confirmation, indicating that oxidative stress is a central mediator of NP cardiotoxicity.\n\n## Hematologic system\nA parallel line of evidence implicates the vascular and hematologic systems as downstream targets of metal NP exposure. Complex firearms-derived aerosols containing mixed metal oxides (copper, zinc, and tin) provoke endothelial cytokine release and platelet activation, producing a prothrombotic profile even in the absence of ROS intermediates [50]. Complementary mechanistic models show that copper and zinc oxide NPs induce oxidative DNA damage, apoptosis, and dysregulation of vasoactive signaling, while cerium oxide produces minimal response, underscoring the role of composition and solubility in vascular risk [51–53]. Under physiological conditions, titanium dioxide NPs cause erythrocyte lysis only in serum-free systems, an effect neutralized by trace plasma proteins [54]. Palladium NPs tested in parallel airway, endothelial, and whole-blood models induce apoptosis, platelet consumption, and thrombin generation through kallikrein–kinin activation, despite weak surface-driven FXII autoactivation [55]. These data suggest a shifting emphasis from direct hemolysis to thrombo-inflammatory mechanisms as the predominant cardiovascular risk pathway for metal-based nanomaterials.\n\n## Nervous system\nEvidence from human and experimental studies indicates that metal-containing NPs can penetrate and interact with neural tissue, although the extent and character of the resulting toxicity vary according to particle composition, physicochemical properties, and biological context [56]. Autopsy investigations of young urban residents have revealed iron-, aluminum-, and titanium-rich NPs within the brainstem, including the substantia nigra, where they were co-localized with neuropathological markers of neurodegenerative disease such as hyperphosphorylated tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 [56]. Morphological assessment distinguished elongated titanium clusters (9 to 60 nm) associated with neuroenteric deposition from larger, spherical titanium dioxide particles typical of food sources (30 to 410 nm), suggesting distinct exposure routes: axonal transport for titanium and inhalation for aluminum and iron aggregates [56]. Though one study, it offers support for a model in which chronic environmental exposure to metal-containing NPs may catalyze protein misfolding and aggregation, promoting neurodegenerative pathology [56]. Experimental data from non-human neuronal systems provide complementary mechanistic evidence. While rodent-derived cell lines have shown that titanium dioxide NPs trigger oxidative stress–mediated apoptosis [57], findings in human-derived models are more variable. Comparative work across human lung, liver, glial, and neuronal cell lines has demonstrated robust NP internalization without corresponding increases in micronucleus formation or cytotoxicity, a finding attributed to the dynamic balance between endocytosis and exocytosis that modulates intracellular accumulation and may underlie the attenuated responses observed relative to animal models [43]. Further evidence from human neuronal and glial cultures exposed to cerium oxide NPs indicates minimal cytotoxic and genotoxic effects, even after extended exposures, consistent with the relatively low neurotoxicity observed in vivo and the proposed redox-stabilizing behavior of nanoceria [58]. Collectively, the literature delineates a gradient of neurotoxic response in which animal and non-human models consistently exhibit oxidative and apoptotic effects following exposure to metal-containing NPs, whereas human-derived systems display attenuated or variable outcomes. This divergence likely reflects species-specific differences in uptake dynamics, repair capacity, and NP persistence, underscoring the need for approaches that clarify the human relevance of NP-induced neurotoxicity.\n\n## Reproductive system\nA study examining placental tissue from mothers with environmental air pollution exposure identified exogenous, carbonaceous NPs within tissue-resident phagocytic cells. Using magnetic analyses and electron microscopy, researchers confirmed these NPs were iron-rich, co-associated with other trace metals, and morphologically consistent with combustion- and friction-derived pollutants. This establishes that inhaled NPs can translocate systemically, cross into the placenta, and be taken up by placental cells, potentiating a direct pathway for fetal exposure to environmental and potentially occupational NPs [59].\n\n## Genotoxicity\nResearch on NP genotoxicity has progressed from descriptive demonstrations of DNA damage toward mechanistic and methodological refinement. Early human studies showed that sub-cytotoxic exposures could yield persistent genomic injury, with zinc oxide causing cumulative DNA fragmentation without apoptosis and titanium dioxide producing oxidative stress, apoptosis, and micronuclei formation, together implicating oxidative stress and inefficient DNA repair as key determinants of NP-induced genotoxicity [60, 61]. Later barrier-specific work revealed that different cell types vary in susceptibility: endothelial and macrophage-like cells displayed DNA damage and checkpoint activation, while A549 remained comparatively resistant, and altering glutathione content modulated outcomes [43, 62]. Additional studies expanded mechanistic understanding. Titanium-induced mucin and Toll-like receptor signaling clarified inflammatory pathways but contributed little to DNA-damage mechanisms [63], while comparative analyses of silver, gold, and platinum metallic NPs confirmed that silver remains uniquely genotoxic across particle sizes, reflecting dissolution-driven reactivity rather than size dependence [64]. In sums, these studies established that genotoxic potential depends not only on material reactivity but also on the antioxidant and repair capacities of individual cell types. Subsequent research shifted attention from simple strand-break detection to the cellular machinery governing persistence of damage. Titanium dioxide NPs were found to suppress both base- and nucleotide-excision repair activities and down-regulate multiple repair genes through promoter hypermethylation, linking exposure to transcriptional and epigenetic repression of repair capacity [65]. Epigenomic profiling extended this concept: short, non-cytotoxic exposures to various engineered nanomaterials altered DNA methylation of repetitive elements and decreased expression of DNA-methylation enzymes, suggesting that epigenetic drift could prolong genomic instability even after the exposure period ended [24, 42]. Zinc oxide exposure elicited pronounced oxidative and apoptotic signaling without activating key DNA repair pathways, and similar transcriptional profiling of cobalt and cerium oxide NPs showed that such stress responses vary by cell type, with stronger inflammatory signaling observed in macrophages, in contrast to the weaker oxidative activation seen in epithelial cells, indicating that NP-induced cellular stress often occurs without effective engagement of DNA repair mechanisms [34, 66, 67]. Parallel to mechanistic advances, modeling approaches for assessing NP genotoxicity underwent significant revision. The emergence of air–liquid interface (ALI) culture systems revealed that apparent DNA and cytotoxic damage often decreased under realistic aerosol deposition compared to submerged monolayers. Early ALI work showed negligible silver-NP cytotoxicity or inflammation at surface doses consistent with human exposure, challenging the reliability of conventional in vitro estimates [68, 69]; subsequent comparisons confirmed that once dosimetry and agglomeration were controlled, these systems yielded weaker acute responses than submerged cultures [70]. Multi-material testing in 3D bronchial tissue models further emphasized that genotoxicity largely tracked with the chemistry and solubility of the core material rather than particle size or coating. Only zinc oxide, citrate-stabilized silver, and a few silicon or zirconium oxides produced measurable DNA damage, while inert oxides were negative at comparable uptake fractions, and complementary airway co-culture models using human-relevant dosimetry showed similarly conservative outcomes, indicating that realistic tissue barriers substantially attenuate both genotoxic and inflammatory responses observed in simpler systems [71, 72]. Methodological realism continued to advance. Primary small-airway epithelium at the ALI exhibited transcriptomic and microRNA signatures of oxidative and genotoxic stress that paralleled in vivo inhalation findings, demonstrating that such barrier-competent systems can capture molecular responses at low, non-lethal doses [73]. Interlaboratory assessments later cautioned, however, that reproducibility of ALI endpoints remains variable and that even advanced 3-D constructs may miss subtle genotoxic effects at realistic exposures [74]. These investigations show that NP genotoxicity cannot be reduced to a single determinant: oxidative stress, deficient repair activation, and epigenetic dysregulation all contribute, while improved modeling has tempered apparent hazard by introducing realistic deposition and tissue barriers. The evolution from descriptive findings to mechanistic clarity is well illustrated by the research trajectory of cobalt NPs. Early studies demonstrated that cobalt-containing particulates could damage DNA in human cells [75–77]. These reports showed that cobalt metal, cobalt–tungsten carbide, and cobalt chloride caused DNA strand breaks and inhibited repair in isolated human lymphocytes, and later work extended these findings to nanoscale cobalt systems where oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities were observed in human bronchial and leukocyte models [76, 77]. Although methodologically limited, this early work introduced the concept that cobalt particulates in nanoscale form possess intrinsic genotoxic potential through oxidative and repair-interfering mechanisms rather than through overt cytotoxicity alone. Subsequent research refined these observations into a mechanistic framework focused on cobalt oxides, particularly Co₃O₄ [40, 78, 79]. These cobalt oxide NPs were shown to elicit both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human hepatocellular and respiratory models, with oxidative stress as a unifying mediator and minimal contribution from ionic cobalt [40, 79]. Across these studies, cobalt oxides produced little overt cytotoxicity but clear oxidative and genotoxic effects consistent with a “Trojan horse” mechanism in which intracellular particle uptake and localized dissolution generate reactive cobalt ions that damage DNA [78, 79]. Under sub-cytotoxic conditions, single-strand DNA breaks were observed in bronchial epithelial cells, implicating ROS as the direct driver of genotoxicity [78]. Collectively, this phase of research marked a shift from describing cobalt-induced DNA damage to explaining how physicochemical properties, especially solubility and intracellular dissolution, determine the balance between cytotoxic and genotoxic outcomes. A clear inflection point in this trajectory was reached when standardized comparative testing showed that cobalt metal and cobalt(II) oxide NPs exhibited marked oxidative and genotoxic activity in human lung epithelial cells, whereas cobalt(II, III) oxide, although efficiently internalized, produced negligible oxidative stress or DNA damage [80]. This clarified that low solubility can limit cobalt ion release sufficiently to suppress observable biological reactivity. This progression redefined cobalt nanotoxicology from a descriptive field identifying genotoxic hazards to a mechanistic discipline capable of distinguishing when and why cobalt oxide NPs cause oxidative DNA injury despite minimal cytotoxicity.\n\n## Cobalt\nThe evolution from descriptive findings to mechanistic clarity is well illustrated by the research trajectory of cobalt NPs. Early studies demonstrated that cobalt-containing particulates could damage DNA in human cells [75–77]. These reports showed that cobalt metal, cobalt–tungsten carbide, and cobalt chloride caused DNA strand breaks and inhibited repair in isolated human lymphocytes, and later work extended these findings to nanoscale cobalt systems where oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal abnormalities were observed in human bronchial and leukocyte models [76, 77]. Although methodologically limited, this early work introduced the concept that cobalt particulates in nanoscale form possess intrinsic genotoxic potential through oxidative and repair-interfering mechanisms rather than through overt cytotoxicity alone. Subsequent research refined these observations into a mechanistic framework focused on cobalt oxides, particularly Co₃O₄ [40, 78, 79]. These cobalt oxide NPs were shown to elicit both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in human hepatocellular and respiratory models, with oxidative stress as a unifying mediator and minimal contribution from ionic cobalt [40, 79]. Across these studies, cobalt oxides produced little overt cytotoxicity but clear oxidative and genotoxic effects consistent with a “Trojan horse” mechanism in which intracellular particle uptake and localized dissolution generate reactive cobalt ions that damage DNA [78, 79]. Under sub-cytotoxic conditions, single-strand DNA breaks were observed in bronchial epithelial cells, implicating ROS as the direct driver of genotoxicity [78]. Collectively, this phase of research marked a shift from describing cobalt-induced DNA damage to explaining how physicochemical properties, especially solubility and intracellular dissolution, determine the balance between cytotoxic and genotoxic outcomes. A clear inflection point in this trajectory was reached when standardized comparative testing showed that cobalt metal and cobalt(II) oxide NPs exhibited marked oxidative and genotoxic activity in human lung epithelial cells, whereas cobalt(II, III) oxide, although efficiently internalized, produced negligible oxidative stress or DNA damage [80]. This clarified that low solubility can limit cobalt ion release sufficiently to suppress observable biological reactivity. This progression redefined cobalt nanotoxicology from a descriptive field identifying genotoxic hazards to a mechanistic discipline capable of distinguishing when and why cobalt oxide NPs cause oxidative DNA injury despite minimal cytotoxicity.\n\n## Respiratory system\nThe uptake of aerosolized nanometals in industry, commercial or home products is expected to occur via nasal or oral inhalation, as one of the earliest and most relevant routes of exposure in occupational and environmental toxicology. The majority of cell-based modelling of respiratory-related nanometal effects has focused on toxicant-mediated pathogenic effects of intranasal, buccal, bronchial, tracheal, and alveolar epithelial cells. Chemical composition analyses of occupational or environmental exposures, such as welding fumes, firearm fumes or other ballistic aerosols, often identify a range of chemical and metal constituents for study [50, 81–84]. Studies have demonstrated titanium and iron NPs in coal fly ash, and, in firearm fumes, aluminum, antimony, barium, calcium, copper, iron, potassium, lead, sulfur, sodium, strontium, tin, zinc, tungsten, nickel, iron, and cobalt [85]. Welding fumes produce a mixture of iron, manganese, nickel, chromium, scandium, vanadium, cobalt, copper, rubidium, niobium, and cesium, and indoor combustion sources such as incense and mosquito coils produce cadmium NPs [86–88]. Welding fumes containing iron and manganese NPs elicit strong cytokine signaling in respiratory epithelia, particularly via IL-8, TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2, and HO-1, with IL-8 often predominating; comparable IL-8 upregulation occurs with zinc oxide and related metal oxide NPs through NFκB- and C/EBPβ-dependent transcription and mRNA stabilization mechanisms, and concurrent induction of HO-1 and metallothionein serves as a general marker of metal-oxide cytotoxicity [11, 89–91]. Taken together, these models suggest a risk for carcinogenicity, epithelial toxicity, and cytotoxicity. Common findings among respiratory epithelial cell models show that metal-containing NPs, to varying extents depending on their composition, generate ROS and cause cytotoxicity, with the greatest effects observed for zinc, copper, and nickel oxides [91, 92]. Zinc oxide NPs have demonstrated altered gene expression of immune cells, induction of ROS, increased cytokine signaling and cytotoxicity [89, 93–95]. Implicated mechanisms for zinc oxide cytotoxicity are related to intracellular dissolution, which leads to zinc ion homeostatic disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis [96]; other mechanisms are mitochondrial inhibition of complex I and II, altered mitochondrial fission and fusion protein expression, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by ROS and NF-kb, and interactions with lung surfactant components like dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which increases the membrane damage caused by zinc oxide NPs [93–98]. Induction of ROS and cytotoxicity has been similarly demonstrated in bronchial epithelial and alveolar cell modeling of titanium dioxide, gold, palladium, lead halide perovskite, iron, and manganese [11, 30, 37, 55, 93–95, 99, 100]. Induction of apoptosis in alveolar cells is demonstratable with model exposures to zinc, nickel, and tungsten carbide cobalt NPs [92, 101, 102]. Titanium dioxide is present as a ubiquitous whitening pigment and is widely used in catalytic and photocatalytic applications such as water and air filtration and self-cleaning surfaces. Models of respiratory toxicity from titanium dioxide have been conflicting, with several studies failing to demonstrate cytotoxicity or micronuclei genotoxicity markers at varying concentrations and in various cells lines [43, 74, 103, 104]. However, titanium dioxide exposed alveolar and bronchial models have shown altered expression of histone deacetylase 9, which is an epigenetic modifier, and that production of ROS, cytotoxicity, glutathione production, and DNA double strand breaks are influenced by titanium dioxide agglomeration, the presence of a more toxic nanofiber rather than nanoparticle, or the predominance of the anatase or rutile structure [30, 99, 105–107]. Interactions with the pulmonary surfactant is a critical factor, as components like DPPC have been shown to coat silver nanoparticles, improving their dispersion and delaying the release of toxic ions [108]. Shotgun proteomics, a high-throughput mass-spectrometry technique that identifies and quantifies proteins from complex mixtures, have identified one underlying mechanism as the dysregulation of protein phosphorylation sites, with subsequent impact on DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, autophagy and cytoskeletal structure and dynamics, cellular transport, RNA dynamics, with a central role of p53 [65]. Epithelial barrier integrity, as in studies of genotoxicity, represents a central determinant of NP behavior in vitro, shaping both apparent toxicity and the way experimental results are extrapolated to human risk. Barrier status influences not only particle uptake and translocation but also the interpretation of downstream effects such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell viability. Modern respiratory models increasingly emphasize this point through advanced in vitro systems that recapitulate the ALI, allowing aerosolized nanometal exposures to occur under physiologically relevant conditions [74, 109–111]. These systems demonstrate that deposition dynamics, dissolution, and ionic transformation vary substantially from submerged monolayer cultures, leading to lower apparent toxicity at realistic doses. Methodological refinements, including electrostatic deposition, dynamic flow exposure, and barrier maturation protocols, have enabled closer approximation to in vivo airway deposition while highlighting the role of serum and protein coronas in modulating NP reactivity [112, 113]. Multiparametric approaches have further clarified that protein adsorption and cytokine binding can confound apparent inflammatory outcomes in submerged assays, reinforcing the need for integrated evaluation of intracellular, secreted, and transcriptional endpoints [114]. Collectively, these studies mark a shift from simplified cytotoxicity assays toward barrier-competent reagents that can distinguish direct nanomaterial effects from secondary phenomena related to barrier disruption or ion-mediated stress. With these modeling advances established, current research has turned toward the consequences of barrier loss itself, examining how disruption of tight and adherens junctions alters respiratory permeability and permits NP translocation into systemic circulation and target organs. Loss of barrier integrity in this manners, independent of cytotoxicity and altered gene expression, has been demonstrated with silver and tungsten NPs as well as titanium dioxide [103, 115, 116]. Notably, the loss of cell membrane integrity induced by nano zero-valent iron and zinc oxide NPs occurs via inflammatory responses in endothelial cells and is concurrent with production of ROS, cytotoxicity, and cytokine signaling [89, 117, 118]. Disruption of tight junctions is associated with multiple atopic and inflammatory disease states, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease [115]. However, loss of epithelial barrier integrity is not a consistent finding across models; one 3D bronchial epithelial model (Calu-3) for silver NPs did not disrupt epithelial barriers or induce cytotoxicity [119]. These advances redefine respiratory nanotoxicology by shifting attention from isolated cytotoxic endpoints to barrier-dependent mechanisms of injury and repair. Another critical determinant of respiratory response is the pulmonary surfactant layer that lines the alveoli and airways. This lipid–protein interface governs NP dispersion, dissolution, and cellular contact, yet its influence on toxicity remains context dependent. Natural surfactant mixtures can attenuate silver NP cytotoxicity by limiting ionic release [120], whereas other formulations fail to suppress the oxidative or inflammatory effects of silver nanowires [121]. In some cases, single surfactant components such as DPPC even exacerbate oxidative stress and cytokine signaling [122]. For zinc oxide nanowires, surfactant coatings delayed early cell death but increased uptake and delayed toxicity [123]. These findings illustrate that pulmonary surfactant interactions are a key but variable modifier of NP behavior, and that faithfully incorporating the biochemical and biophysical complexity of this interface into advanced airway models remains a continuing methodological limitation in respiratory nanotoxicology. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular program in which epithelial cells lose polarity and adhesion, acquiring migratory and fibroblast-like traits central to fibrosis and remodeling. NP exposure can induce EMT through oxidative stress and DNA damage–mediated activation of the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 base-excision repair pathway [124]. Palladium NPs from catalytic converters and lead perovskite both trigger EMT in bronchial epithelial cells via TGF-β1 signaling, implicating EMT dysregulation in fibrotic and structural lung disease [55, 100]. Uncoated cerium oxide NPs, over 80% internalized by lung epithelium within 24 h, directly stimulate collagen synthesis and fibroblastic nodule formation in human lung fibroblasts-effects mitigated by silica coating as a safety-by-design measure [125, 126]. Titanium- and iron-based cosmetic aerosols deposit ultrafine particles in tracheobronchial regions, where exposure produces greater oxidative stress and accumulation of 8-oxoguanine DNA lesions than equivalent doses of pristine titanium or iron NPs [124]. Beyond epithelial effects, zinc oxide and copper oxide NPs diminish airway smooth-muscle contractility through non-ROS biomechanical mechanisms [127], suggesting a broader role of nanometal exposure in respiratory dysfunction. Considered in context, these findings indicate that NP toxicity in the respiratory tract arises less from size alone than from persistent oxidative and signaling disruptions that reprogram both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments.\n\n## Exposure measurement\nUnderstanding NP toxicity requires accounting for the exposure phase, particle chemistry, and realistic dosing. As previously discussed, most in vitro studies utilize submerged cell cultures; however, these systems do not entirely replicate the manner in which aerosols interact with airway surfaces. Comparisons under equivalent mass doses show that zinc oxide NPs delivered as aerosols produce earlier oxidative and inflammatory responses than suspensions, with peak effects at four hours instead of twenty-four, but the total response magnitude later converges, indicating that liquid systems delay but do not prevent cellular injury [128]. Chemical transformations in air further influence toxicity: magnetite NPs coated by acidic or organic films release more soluble iron and provoke stronger oxidative and cytokine responses than uncoated forms [129]. Atmospheric processing, not only composition or size, determines biological activity. Controlled human inhalation studies define the boundary between mechanistic data and occupational exposure. Inhalation of 0.5 mg/m³ zinc oxide produced no measurable systemic or respiratory effects [130]. Subsequent work demonstrated a concentration-dependent inflammatory response across 0.5–2 mg/m³ nano-ZnO, with significant increases in neutrophils and acute-phase proteins at and above 1 mg/m³, defining the lower threshold for transient systemic effects [131]. A later comparison at 2 mg/m³ under exertion showed similar responses for nano- and micro-ZnO, with slightly higher values for the latter due to greater deposition efficiency rather than particle size toxicity [132]. Across these investigations, toxicity scaled primarily with deposited mass and ionic dissolution rather than nominal particle size. Simulations of workplace aerosols demonstrate that biologically relevant cellular doses are orders of magnitude lower than those typically applied in in vitro toxicology studies [12]. These modeling approaches define the concentration range within which experimental data can be meaningfully compared to human exposure scenarios. Field measurements complement this framework by confirming that respirable NPs are generated under ordinary use conditions. For example, commercial spray products emitting titanium dioxide can transiently exceed recommended exposure limits during brief applications [13]. Broader assessments show that indoor nanomaterial measurements often capture mixed emissions from combustion sources and process aerosols rather than the engineered product itself [14]. These findings link modeled exposure potential with real-world aerosol occurrence, showing that accurate interpretation of NP toxicity requires consideration of realistic dose levels and environmental context, as demonstrated in occupational settings such as welding and firearm exposure. While metal fume fever has been recognized for decades [133], the contribution of nano-sized particulate matter is now being described. Lung-tissue analysis of professional welders identified iron, manganese, and chromium oxide NPs within macrophages and fibrotic regions, linking chronic exposure to persistent inflammation [134]. Modeled airflow studies indicate that only about 1% of welding-fume agglomerates deposit in the olfactory mucosa, but morphology, long chains versus compact clusters, strongly influences this fraction [135]. Thus, particle geometry contributes to deposition and potential for systemic translocation. Because manganese constitutes a major component of many welding aerosols, these deposition patterns have important implications for neurotoxicity, with elevated blood manganese levels linked to basal ganglia hyperintensity on MRI and reduced working-memory performance in exposed workers even at routine exposure levels [136, 137]. Controlled exposure of apprentice welders to tungsten inert gas fumes demonstrated transient oxidative stress, with elevated hydrogen peroxide and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in plasma and urine three hours post-exposure [138]. Comparable findings in active stainless-steel welders showed chromium and nickel in exhaled breath condensate correlated with oxidative biomarkers [139]. Quantitative exposure measurements reinforce this relevance. Comparative monitoring of carbon-steel and aluminum welding revealed alveolar-deposited surface areas exceeding tens of thousands of µm²/cm³, demonstrating that even low-fume processes emit respirable ultrafine particles [140]. This is convergent evidence that welding aerosols contribute to measurable biological stress, with deposition behavior, surface area, and transition-metal content as key determinants of effect. Military facilities and indoor firing ranges generate complex aerosols composed of ultrafine metals and combustion gases. Characterization of shooting-range air shows that it contains respirable lead and antimony particles with high alveolar deposition potential [81]. Replacement of lead-based ammunition with alternative compositions reduces classical toxicants but introduces copper, zinc, manganese, and boron NPs, shifting rather than removing risk [81]. Experimental studies using collected firearm particles demonstrate oxidative stress and cytokine release in lung epithelial cultures, with highest toxicity from copper- and zinc-rich emissions [83]. ALI exposures to freshly generated firearm discharge confirm that these aerosols reduce cell viability and induce IL-8 signaling, with rifle fire producing greater effects than handguns [141]. Controlled exposures of ALI cultures to fumes from steel-core ammunition show similar findings, including genotoxicity linked to transition-metal and gas co-pollutant mixtures [82]. Human monitoring extends these observations. Repeated occupational exposure among firearm instructors is associated with oxidative-stress biomarkers and elevated urinary copper despite airborne metal levels below current limits [142]. Studies in police instructors exposed to similar ultrafine particle environments showed small, non-significant increases in inflammatory and endothelial markers, suggesting possible early biological responses that warrant continued investigation [143]. That said, while these studies suggest only mild or subclinical biological responses, the absence of pronounced nanometal toxicity should not be interpreted as evidence of safety, since firing-range personnel commonly exhibit elevated blood lead levels consistent with ongoing cumulative metal exposure [144–146].\n\n## Welding fumes\nWhile metal fume fever has been recognized for decades [133], the contribution of nano-sized particulate matter is now being described.

Characterization of shooting-range air shows that it contains respirable lead and antimony particles with high alveolar deposition potential [81]. Replacement of lead-based ammunition with alternative compositions reduces classical toxicants but introduces copper, zinc, manganese, and boron NPs, shifting rather than removing risk [81].

Yet, the chemical itself can be a key factor, such as when comparing the minimal inflammatory potential of barium sulfate compared to zinc oxide [99, 147]. For a given material like titanium dioxide, specific features such as primary particle size, crystal structure, and agglomeration state can significantly impact its demonstrable toxic effects [28]. It is also noteworthy that even previously considered non-toxic NPs may demonstrate toxic effect in the right circumstances: cerium(IV) oxide NPs did not exhibit any toxic effect by itself, but when zinc oxides were combined with cerium(IV) oxide, cytotoxic effects were observed, and IL-8 and ROS generation were higher when zinc oxide NPs were combined with CeO2 NPs, compared to ZnO alone [89]. The mechanism by which this potentiation of toxicity occurs in the presence of individually non-toxic cerium(IV) oxide is unclear, but may be due to changes in the oxidation state in the presence of zinc oxide [89]. These cell models underscore a critical point: the toxicity of a given NP can be significantly altered by its physicochemical state or by interactions with other metals, chemicals, or organic matter, warranting continued investigation even for materials presumed to be inert. Cell-based and in vitro models comprise the vast majority of extant literature for the toxicologic effects of metal-containing NPs in human organ systems. Any assessment of the existing body of literature must inherently acknowledge the limitations of such models to translate into clinically relevant toxicant-mediated end-organ effects or toxicant-related disease pathogenesis. For example, in vitro hemolysis induced from washed human erythrocytes exposed to titanium dioxide NPs would not imply an expectation for intravascular hemolysis in vivo among consumers exposed to TiO2 NPs from home sunscreen application given the specific limitation of the model to mimic real-world exposure conditions; i.e., the presence of human plasma which would be expected to abolish the effect [54]. Further limitations include an inconsistent cross-study model design, with some studies using an ALI to expose cells to NPs and others using a method for a submerged interface for NP exposures to cells. One ALI model using aerosol exposure chambers, which are self-contained cell culture systems that allow direct exposure to nanoparticles or other aerosols, demonstrated a greater increase in cytotoxicity and a larger reduction in cell viability for M4 rifle fumes compared to the M9 pistol, in A549 alveolar cells exposed to particulate iron-, nickel-, and copper-containing fumes generated directly from firing chambers [141]. ALI models such as this are considered superior in their ability to replicate in vitro conditions that more closely represent in vivo tissue–toxicant exposures, but reproducibility and experimental technique remain non-uniform across studies. The continued development and standardization of these models are likely to define the future of toxicologic research on nanoparticles [141]. However, the use of in vitro modelling holds advantages in allowing the elucidation of mechanistic cellular-based toxicities, and to avoid the obvious ethical quandaries of human-exposure implementation for toxicant NPs of interest. Furthermore, in vitro modelling tends to allow researchers to isolate individual NPs to identify their independent toxic profile, whereas an in vivo exposure model would tend to reflect end-organ toxicities from multiple simultaneous exposures. In a real-world occupational chemical characterization model in which shipyard abrasion and spray painting emissions were characterized for nanometal emissions (20 to 110 nm), the metal aerosol composition consisted of scandium, vanadium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rubidium, niobium, and cesium [86], and similarly, studies on consumer spray products have shown they can also be a source of exposure, generating respirable aerosols containing NPs such as titanium dioxide [13]. Upon exposure to these spray-painting aerosols, the majority composition described as copper and vanadium NPs, human alveolar cells (A549) demonstrated cytotoxicity, production of ROS, and increases in micronuclei frequency, indicating genotoxicity. Given the high prevalence of nanotechnologies in industry, commerce, and domestic use, a continued, systematic approach that couples chemical composition studies of mixed aerosol, dermal, and enteral metal-containing nanoparticle hazards with in vitro cellular analyses is essential for identifying disease states of interest and guiding future clinical research and monitoring. Where data are inconsistent in demonstrating NP-mediated tissue toxicity, such as with TiO2 inhalational exposure, it would suggest that an opportunity in future study would be for greater consistency of modelling between studies in order to enhance reproducibility of effects and instill greater confidence in interpretation of results [74, 103, 104, 113]. There is a continued need for studies in compositional analysis of environmental, occupational, and domestic exposures to NPs, especially as it is used in exposure-risk assessment models that couple with cellular toxicity modelling based on those toxicant exposures. Though certain nanometals such as silver NPs carry published recommended exposure limits from National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), other NPs with well described cellular toxicity such as zinc oxide NPs are not yet specifically addressed, and even with silver NPs, a computational fluid dynamics model of a short-term inhalation of 10 µg AgNP/m3, based on an exposure on NIOSH exposure limits for silver NPs yielded a blood-silver accumulation of 0.46 to 64 mg per year, which does exceed the lowest adverse effect level of 25 mg for an adult male [148]. In physiology based lung model using probabilistic risk assessment, the risk of titanium dioxide sprays in commercial spray sunscreen suggested that that application of sunscreen sprays poses no significant health risk; however, authors noted that sprays were only pressed twice within a certain period and that frequency of application is likely to be higher in consumer use according to guidelines on the product labels [149]. The burden and continued need for reassessment of risk will only continue to grow as these nanometals become ever more ubiquitous in daily life. Special emphasis should be made to identify readily obtainable biomarkers for significant NP, such as C-reactive protein or interferon gamma in nasal secretions, which correlate with exposure to ultrafine zinc and copper-containing welding fumes [150]. Once identified, such biomarkers could enable population-level monitoring to better correlate exposure with disease incidence. Titanium dioxide, the most widespread metal-containing nanoparticle in consumer and industrial products, exemplifies the need for accessible biomonitoring and ongoing reassessment of health risk as evidence accumulates linking epithelial barrier dysfunction to respiratory outcomes, including atopic and asthma-spectrum disease. This review has several limitations inherent to its scope and design. The search was limited to the PubMed database and English-language publications, which likely excluded relevant studies indexed elsewhere or reported in other languages. The review period was restricted to the past two decades, reflecting the era in which “nanoparticle” terminology and characterization became standardized; earlier ultrafine-particle studies may therefore contain relevant findings that were not captured. No formal critical appraisal of study quality was conducted due to the absence of any established framework specific to nanometal toxicology. Finally, given the heterogeneity of in vitro models and exposure systems, reproducibility across studies remains limited, and results should be interpreted as a conceptual evidence map rather than a quantitative synthesis.\n\n## Limitations\nThis review has several limitations inherent to its scope and design.

Bridging this gap requires a continued, multi-faceted approach that integrates compositional analysis of environmental hazards with more standardized in vitro systems and the development of accessible biomarkers. Such efforts are essential for creating evidence-based risk assessments and regulatory frameworks capable of protecting public health in an era of ever-increasing NP exposure.",
