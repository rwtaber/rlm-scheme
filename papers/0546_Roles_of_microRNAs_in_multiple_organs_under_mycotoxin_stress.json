  "abstract": "Mycotoxins are naturally produced by certain fungi and are common food contaminants that endanger human health and well-being worldwide. They have broad implications, including roles in carcinogenesis, which is often fatal. Therefore, identifying new biomarkers of mycotoxin activity and enabling early diagnosis of mycotoxin-induced diseases is critical. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and influence different physiological processes, including those involved in heart disease, cancer, and apoptosis. Furthermore, miRNAs are often involved in mycotoxin-induced toxicity and respond to various environmental factors. In this review, we discuss the miRNAs altered in response to important mycotoxins in several organisms, with a focus on the predicted biological roles and targets of miRNAs regulated by two common mycotoxins: aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A. This review aims to serve as a resource for researchers and scientists working to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying mycotoxin toxicity and developing targeted interventions to prevent and control mycotoxin-induced damage to various organs.",

      "text": "Typically, nascent primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are converted into microRNAs (miRNAs) through two sequential cleavage events. miRNAs are produced by the miRNA biogenesis pathway, which involves multiple steps and numerous proteins and enzymes. The DGCR8 subunit of the Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessor complex first interacts with Drosha to process pri-miRNAs. Drosha then releases a hairpin-shaped precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), approximately 65 nucleotides long (Denli, et al., 2004; Pong and Gullerova, 2018). Exportin 5 transports the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm, where the RNase Dicer cleaves it to form a mature miRNA (approximately 22 nucleotides). The resulting small RNA duplex is loaded onto an Argonaute protein, where one strand is preferentially retained while the other is degraded. To target mRNAs for translational degradation or inhibition, one strand of mature miRNA is loaded onto complexes containing Argonaute (Macrae, et al., 2006). miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and responding to environmental stresses such as oxidative stress and DNA damage. They are implicated in many biological processes, including human diseases (Bottai, et al., 2014; Wang, et al., 2010) and drug resistance (Gomes, et al., 2016). In addition, miRNA expression profiles show that miRNAs are expressed in utero in response to various environmental factors, including xenochemicals (e.g., ethanol, bisphenol A, and gold nanoparticles), endogenous factors (e.g., hypoxia or oxidative stress), and certain nutritional states (e.g., high-fat diets) (Kappil and Chen, 2014). miRNAs have been used as diagnostic biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer. Because miRNAs are distinct biomarkers and detectable in the serum, saliva, and urine, they serve as valuable biological indicators for disease detection and prevention. miRNAs regulate gene transcription in eukaryotes and influence gene expression in mammals (Catalanotto, et al., 2016). Therefore, identifying miRNAs that inhibit the transcription and translation of disease-promoting genes is a promising strategy for disease prevention and control. While protein assays are commonly used for the early detection of mycotoxin pathogenicity, miRNA detection is often disregarded. miRNAs are found in tissues and body fluids, making diagnosis possible by identifying differentially expressed miRNAs. Moreover, their high sensitivity and specificity enable the detection of early-stage disorders and prediction of disease progression and drug resistance (Chen et al., 2022). miRNA interference has potential as a method to prevent mycotoxin toxicity. Mycotoxins are among the most prevalent food contaminants, and miRNAs have recently been reported to play a role in the body’s response to mycotoxins (Chen, Yang, Li, Wu, Nepovimova, Long, Wu and Kuca, 2022; Rong, et al., 2019). Therefore, understanding miRNAs may promote the identification of novel biomarkers for determining toxin exposure and disease risk. In this review, we summarize the effects of mycotoxins on miRNA expression in various organs and discuss the potential biological roles and targets of miRNAs regulated by two common toxins, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA). This review highlights miRNA targets associated with mycotoxin exposure, offering insights into mycotoxin-associated pathways and the identification of biomarkers for the detection, prevention, and management of mycotoxin-related diseases. AFB1 and OTA are emphasized because of their high toxicity, widespread occurrence in food and feed sources, and detrimental effects on both health and the economy. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites generated by fungi that contaminate food and pose a global threat to human health and welfare (Milićević, et al., 2016). Several fungi, such as Aspergillus, Claviceps, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Alternaria, produce different mycotoxins (Steyn, 1995). Mycotoxins are found in animal feed and products as well as in food (Balázs and Schepers, 2007) and can affect multiple organs, particularly the digestive tract, including the colon (Gajęcka, et al., 2018), liver (Wang, et al., 2019c), esophagus (Yekeler, et al., 2001), stomach (Craddock, et al., 1987), and kidneys (Rumora, et al., 2007). Short-term exposure to high doses of mycotoxins causes acute toxicity that manifests as rapid-onset diarrhea, borborygmus, and abdominal pain (Liew and Mohd-Redzwan, 2018). Prolonged exposure to a low dose of mycotoxins can damage the immune and nervous systems, and adversely affect organs such as the kidneys, liver and colon (Gajęcka, Waśkiewicz, Zielonka, Goliński, Rykaczewska, Lisieska-Żołnierczyk and Gajęcki, 2018; Wang, Zhai, Xia, Wang, Ruan, Zhou, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Ren and Yang, 2019c). Mycotoxin exposure has also been associated with various illnesses and cancers, including esophageal carcinoma, obesity, and diabetes (Chen and Wu, 2017; Xue, et al., 2019). Several mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, OTA, and fumonisins, induce cellular stress and damage (Gómez-Osorio, et al., 2024), which can alter the expression profiles of miRNAs across various organs (Kappari, et al., 2024). Different mycotoxins target different organs, leading to distinct patterns of miRNA dysregulation. In the liver, AFB1-induced changes in miRNA expression can affect pathways related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and detoxification (Yang, et al., 2014). In the kidneys, OTA induces nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity by altering miRNA expression (Marin, et al., 2019). Mycotoxins influence miRNA expression through multiple mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of cellular processes and contributing to the etiology of liver and intestinal diseases. The specific miRNAs and molecular pathways affected vary depending on the type of mycotoxin and the target organ (Kappari, Dasireddy, Applegate, Selvaraj and Shanmugasundaram, 2024). The liver is a major target organ for mycotoxins, where they undergo biotransformation and may cause significant damage (Wang, et al., 2023). Mycotoxins such as OTA and AFB1 are particularly well-studied for their effects on hepatic miRNA expression (Jorud, et al., 2024; Luo, et al., 2025). AFB1 is a potent human carcinogen with well-documented hepatotoxic effects (Long, et al., 2016; Shen and Ong, 1996). Exposure to AFB1 can induce cytotoxicity through the generation of reactive oxygen species and genetic alterations, especially in the p53 gene (Peroxisomes, 1995). AFB1 exposure has been shown to alter hepatic miRNA expression, leading to hepatotoxicity and increased risk of liver cancer (Yang, Lian, Feng, Srinivas, Guo, Zhong, Zhuang and Wang, 2014). For example, miRNA-24, modulated by AFB1, has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Liu, et al., 2014b). Additionally, AFB1 exposure upregulates miRNA-122 and miRNA-429, both of which are associated with liver damage and are considered potential biomarkers of liver injury (Livingstone, et al., 2017). In the kidneys, OTA induces nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity through oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and autophagy (Khoi, et al., 2021). OTA also alters miRNA expression profiles associated with renal function, leading to nephrotoxicity (Dai, et al., 2014) (Hennemeier, et al., 2014). OTA can decrease the level of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 via miR-132 and miR-200c, resulting in OTA toxicity (Stachurska, et al., 2013). Moreover, OTA-induced upregulation of miRNA-29b enhances collagen expression in human kidney cells (Hennemeier, Humpf, Gekle and Schwerdt, 2014). In the kidneys of OTA-intoxicated animal models, five miRNAs: miRNA-497, miRNA-133a-3p, miRNA-423-3p, miRNA-34a, and miRNA-542-3p, were upregulated. In contrast, three miRNAs (miRNA-421-3p, miRNA-490, and miRNA-9840-3p) were downregulated (Marin, Braicu, Dumitrescu, Pistol, Cojocneanu, Neagoe and Taranu, 2019). Mycotoxins can also affect the lungs, primarily through oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially leading to respiratory disorders (Huang, et al., 2024; Schütze, et al., 2010). Upregulation of miRNA-155 and a decreased BAX/BCL-2 ratio suggest either a tissue-specific response to OTA exposure or inhibition of TP53-dependent apoptosis in lung fibroblasts (Kharboush, et al., 2024). Additionally, miRNA-138-1 is implicated in AFB1-induced malignant transformation of B-2A13 cells by targeting phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (Wang, et al., 2016). In the intestine, mycotoxins, particularly deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins, are commonly found due to direct exposure from contaminated feed (Pierron, et al., 2016). These toxins can disrupt the intestinal barrier, resulting in inflammation and altered immune responses through changes in miRNA expression (Behrouzi, et al., 2020; Gao, et al., 2020; Gao, et al., 2023). The gut microbiota affects the digestive and immune systems and defends the host against mycotoxicity (Bouhet and Oswald, 2005). Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are exposed to significant doses of food‐associated contaminants, including mycotoxins, depending on their location (Bouhet and Oswald, 2005). IECs respond through the innate local immune response to reduce the threat of infection. Mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, ochratoxins, and zearalenone) affect overall host health through gut microbiota modulation (Liew and Mohd-Redzwan, 2018). miRNAs produced by host IECs modulate the microbiota (Liu, et al., 2016). Metarhizium anisopliae, an entomopathogenic fungus, secretes destruxins as secondary metabolites (Wang, et al., 2004). Destruxins exhibit insecticidal activity against a variety of pests, with modes of action including contact toxicity, gut toxicity, antifeedant effects, ovicidal effects, and oviposition-deterrence (Sowjanya Sree, et al., 2008). Destruxins may function both as V-H+-ATPase inhibitors and calcium ionophores (Vázquez, et al., 2005). Additionally, destruxins possess cytotoxic, antiviral, anticancer, and herbicidal properties (Liu and Tzeng, 2012). Wu et al. (2018) showed that combined treatment with destruxin and the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil synergistically suppressed the viability of colon cancer cells and reduced tumorigenesis in 5-fluorouracil-resistant colon cells by increasing miRNA-214 and downregulating β-catenin and the mammalian target of rapamycin (Wu, et al., 2018). Food and feed supplies are frequently contaminated with alternariol (AOH) produced by Alternaria species. AOH is an emerging mycotoxin with documented negative effects and toxicological risk assessment (Gruber-Dorninger, et al., 2017). AOH has the potential for endocrine disruption, genotoxicity, pro-oxidation activity, and immunomodulation (Kollarova, et al., 2018; Kowalska, et al., 2021; Lehmann, et al., 2006; Tiessen, et al., 2013). Moreover, AOH may affect cell membrane characteristics critical to the innate immune response (Del Favero, et al., 2020). Schmutz et al. (2019) showed that AOH regulates interleukin‐1β‐induced inflammatory responses in differentiated Caco‐2 cells, with induction of miRNA‐16 and miRNA‐125b at 40 µM, suggesting that AOH impacts the immune response at the intestinal barrier (Schmutz, et al., 2019). Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites generated by fungi such as Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. These toxins are common contaminants of a wide range of crops, including tree nuts and cereals (Kumar, et al., 2021). The most common and dangerous of these toxins is AFB1 (Kumar, et al., 2016). Aflatoxin M1, the primary hydroxylated metabolite of AFB1, is also a major concern because it is found in the milk (hence, designation M) of mammals that consume contaminated feedstuff (Marchese, et al., 2018). AFB1 and aflatoxin M1 reduce cell viability in the NCM460 colon epithelial cell line via miRNA-628-3p- and miRNA-217-5p-mediated regulation of cell surface death receptors, as well as miRNA-11y-mediated regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Gao, et al., 2022). Zearalenone (ZEN) and DON are generated by Fusarium species in food products and feeds. In mice, ZEN causes toxicity in the intestine by suppressing immunity (Liu, et al., 2014a). DON, which is found in grains, is one of the most abundant trichothecenes (Mishra, et al., 2020). DON has been reported to have harmful effects on humans and other animals. Pigs exposed to DON exhibit reduced feed consumption as the initial negative consequence; they also show poor immune function, reproductive health, and growth performance (Pierron, Alassane-Kpembi and Oswald, 2016; Reddy, et al., 2018b). Pigs consuming a DON-contaminated diet experience epithelial lesions in the intestine and stomach, along with intestinal inflammation (Pierron, Alassane-Kpembi and Oswald, 2016; Reddy, et al., 2018a). DON has been associated with gut microbiota disruption through the induction of immunotoxicity (Liao, et al., 2018). On exposure to ZEN, porcine IECs showed altered expression profiles of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs (Wang, et al., 2019a). Mycotoxins are metabolized primarily in the liver (Matsuda, et al., 2013; Zöllner, et al., 2002). The liver contributes to detoxification and protection against foreign substances and toxic chemicals (Grant, 1991). When xenobiotics penetrate the body, it produces numerous enzymes that convert them into hydrophilic and polar compounds (Iyanagi, 2007). miRNAs are involved in various liver diseases, such as fibrosis, liver injury, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and HCC (Schueller, et al., 2018). In the liver, miRNA-122 regulates several genes related to hepatic cholesterol and lipid metabolism and is essential for maintaining homeostasis (Wen and Friedman, 2012). Inhibition of miRNA-122 using antisense approaches reduced plasma cholesterol levels in mice (Ma, et al., 2012). Several miRNAs have been found to play a role in liver fibrosis. Serum levels of miRNA-571 and miRNA-122 have been proposed to be potential biomarkers of liver fibrosis (Roderburg, et al., 2012; Waidmann, et al., 2012). Figure 1 summarizes the regulation of miRNAs by mycotoxins in the liver.Figure 1The effect of mycotoxins on miRNA regulation in the liver. The regulation of miRNA by mycotoxin in the liver. Schematic illustration showing the upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue) of miRNAs in liver cells after mycotoxin treatment.Figure 1 The effect of mycotoxins on miRNA regulation in the liver. The regulation of miRNA by mycotoxin in the liver. Schematic illustration showing the upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue) of miRNAs in liver cells after mycotoxin treatment. Aflatoxins, produced by A. flavus, are potent liver toxins, and their presence in food is a major risk factor for HCC (Lin, et al., 2005). In developing countries, HCC accounts for more than 600,000 deaths (Parkin, 2006). Among aflatoxins, AFB1 is the most toxic aflatoxin and has been shown to induce tumors in the liver and other organs such as the colon and kidneys (Maxwell, 1998). In the nucleus, Drosha, an RNase III enzyme, and its cofactor DGCR8 convert pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs, which are then transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (Han, et al., 2004). Mycotoxins can disrupt these processes, potentially influencing the levels of mature miRNA (Gregory, et al., 2006). Reportedly, miRNA biogenesis-related genes, such as Drosha, Dicer, and DGCR8, are disrupted by AFB1 treatment in HepG2 cells (Yang, Lian, Feng, Srinivas, Guo, Zhong, Zhuang and Wang, 2014). Deep sequencing of rat liver tissue showed AFB1-induced hepatic injury and differentially expressed miRNAs; rno-miRNA-34a-5p was upregulated to assist in p53-mediated repair of DNA damage in the F344 rat liver after AFB1 exposure (Liu, et al., 2015). Several studies have shown differentially expressed miRNAs in AFB1-treated human liver cell lines (Marrone, et al., 2016; Zhu, et al., 2015). Marrone et al. (2016) demonstrated that miRNA-122 is inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to AFB1 treatment in HepaRG cells. AFB1-induced down-regulation of miR-122 was linked to suppression of the liver-enriched transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha and miR-122 regulation pathway. miRNA-33a levels were upregulated in HCC cells treated with AFB1 and treatment at IC50 decreased β-catenin expression, which affected the β-catenin pathway and inhibited cell growth (Fang, et al., 2013). Mycotoxins can influence this process by affecting the activity of transcription factors. For example, AFB1 can alter the expression of genes encoding transcription factors such as p53 that regulate miRNA transcription (Fang, Feng, Wu, Srinivas, Yang, Fan, Yang and Wang, 2013). Zhu et al. (2015) conducted miRNA profiling in HepG2 cells treated with AFB1 and found that miRNA-34a was upregulated. This upregulation occurred through multiple pathways, including activation of the p53 pathway, which directly regulates miR-34a transcription. Additionally, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was downregulated, indicating that AFB1 may upregulate miRNA-34a by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Alternaria mycotoxins, such as alternariol (AOH) or altertoxin II (ATX II), are produced by Alternaria spp. These mycotoxins are common food and feed pollutants known for their immunomodulatory properties (Groestlinger, et al., 2022; Schmutz, Cenk and Marko, 2019). Combined treatment of AOH and ATX II induced cytotoxicity in the HCC cell line HepG2 (Vejdovszky, et al., 2017). A microarray study of the expression profiles of miRNAs in HepG2 cells showed that miRNA-4654, miRNA-6720-3p, and miRNA-4715-3p were upregulated by AOH, while miRNA-5583-5p was downregulated following ATX II treatment (Vejdovszky, Sack, Jarolim, Aichinger, Somoza and Marko, 2017). In addition, digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that miRNA-29a was significantly upregulated by AOH alone or in combination with ATX II after 24 h (Vejdovszky, Sack, Jarolim, Aichinger, Somoza and Marko, 2017). Isolated from endophytic fungi abundant in the traditional Chinese medicine herb Artemisia annua, myrothecine A was produced by extracts of Myrothecium roridum strain IFB-E012 (Shen, et al., 2015). Myrothecine A exerts anti-proliferative effects in the human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (Song, et al., 2019). In addition, Fu et al. showed that myrothecine A inhibited cell growth by modulating miRNA-221 in SMMC-7721 cells, indicating its potential use as an antitumor drug for HCC. While myrothecin A could override the inhibitory effect of miR-221 on dendritic cell development, miR-221 controlled dendritic cell maturation in the microenvironment of hepatoma cells (Fu, et al., 2019). OTA, the most prevalent mycotoxin among ochratoxins A, B, and C, is a secondary metabolite generated by Aspergillus and Penicillium (van der Merwe, et al., 1965). OTA causes liver inflammation in humans and other animals (Wang, Zhai, Xia, Wang, Ruan, Zhou, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Ren and Yang, 2019c). Lower doses of OTA do not cause noticeable pathological alterations, however, several early hepatotoxicity investigations using relatively high concentrations of OTA have revealed its ability to cause liver lesions (Aydin, et al., 2003; Ferrante, et al., 2006; Qi, et al., 2014; Rached, et al., 2007). Several studies have shown that OTA regulates liver miRNAs, both in vitro and in vivo (Qi, Yang, Chen, He, Dweep, Guo, Cheng, Xu, Luo, Gretz, Dai and Huang, 2014; Zhao, et al., 2017). HepG2 cells exposed to OTA showed upregulated miRNA-122, the most abundant miRNA in the mammalian liver, and HepG2 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Zhu, et al., 2016). Fumonisin is found in animal feed, human food products, and cereal grains (Knutsen, et al., 2018). Among fumonisins, fumonisin B1 (FB1), FB2, and FB3 are the most abundant and can regulate sphingolipid biosynthesis (Martinova and Merrill 1995; Reisinger, et al., 2016). FB1 is the most toxic fumonisin and has been implicated in HCC and liver tumors in rodents (Gelderblom, et al., 2008). FB1 affects the expression of cell cycle-related genes, including cyclin E and p21 (Wang et al., 2013). FB1 treatment of HepG2 cells significantly inhibited miRNA-27b expression and upregulated human cytochrome P450, a metabolic activator of many procarcinogens (Chuturgoon, et al., 2014). miRNAs play an essential role in kidney development and function (Zhao, et al., 2020). The levels of Dicer, an endonuclease involved in miRNA processing, increased during OTA toxicity (Marin, Braicu, Dumitrescu, Pistol, Cojocneanu, Neagoe and Taranu, 2019). In patients with diabetes and obstructive nephropathy, Dicer deficiency in the proximal tubules increased inflammation, tubular cell death, and interstitial fibrosis, indicating the crucial role of Dicer and its link to miRNAs in the regulation of extracellular matrix accumulation and renal tubular injury (Ma, et al., 2018). Podocyte-specific deletion of Drosha, the core protein involved in miRNA processing, caused severe glomerulopathy (Zhdanova, et al., 2011). Several miRNAs, including miRNA-204, miRNA-215, miRNA-216, miRNA-192, and miRNA-194, are abundantly expressed in human kidneys (Sun, et al., 2004). miRNA-21 enhances kidney fibrosis by modulating metabolic pathways (Chau, et al., 2012). Therefore, miRNAs are important in kidney function. OTA is the most prevalent mycotoxin and one of the most potent nephrotoxins and renal carcinogens in mammals (Pfohl-Leszkowicz and Manderville, 2007). Numerous studies have shown that OTA-induced nephrotoxicity is mediated by miRNAs. For example, treatment of HEK 293 cells with OTA resulted in toxicity and inhibited the expression of miRNA biogenesis genes, such as Dicer1, DGCR8, and Drosha (Zhao, Qi, Dai, He, Dweep, Guo, Luo, Gretz, Luo, Huang, and Xu, 2017). The levels of Dicer1 and Drosha, but not DGR8, are significantly downregulated in the kidneys after OTA administration, indicating impaired miRNA biogenesis (Dai, Zhao, Qi, Xu, He, Guo, Dweep, Cheng, Luo, Xia, Gretz and Huang, 2014). Similarly,Stachurska et al. showed that OTA treatment of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells regulated miRNA processing by enhancing Lin28 protein, DGCR-8, miRNA-132 and miRNA-200c expression (Stachurska, Ciesla, Kozakowska, Wolffram, Boesch-Saadatmandi, Rimbach, Jozkowicz, Dulak and Loboda, 2013). Furthermore, anti-miRNA-132 and anti-miRNA-200c blocked the OTA-mediated reduction in heme oxygenase-1 and the increase in reactive oxygen species production and TGF-β expression. OTA reportedly promotes collagen formation by downregulating miRNA-29b through reducing miRNA-29b levels in the cytoplasm (Hennemeier, Humpf, Gekle and Schwerdt, 2014). Dai et al. conducted miRNA profiling of OTA toxicity in rat kidneys and found miRNA-129, miRNA-130a, miRNA-218b, miRNA-130b, miRNA-141, and miRNA-3588 to be suppressed in medium-dose OTA-treated rat kidneys but upregulated by high-dose OTA treatments (Dai, Zhao, Qi, Xu, He, Guo, Dweep, Cheng, Luo, Xia, Gretz and Huang, 2014). Marin et al., (2019) conducted miRNA profiling of kidneys from piglets fed different doses of OTA-contaminated feed and found elevated levels of miRNA-497, miRNA-133a-3p, miRNA-423-3p, miRNA-34a, miRNA-542-3p, miRNA-490, and miRNA-9840-3p in the kidneys of OTA-treated piglets compared to those of the controls. Citrinin (CTN), produced by the genera Penicillium, Monascus, and Aspergillus, occurs in vegetable-based foods (de Oliveira Filho, et al., 2017). It is a fungal secondary metabolite and a polyketide nephrotoxic mycotoxin that is found in food and feed worldwide and is most common in stored grains (Čulig, et al., 2017). Modest doses of OTA and CTN, alone or in combination, caused lipid peroxidation and time-dependent apoptosis in rabbit kidneys (Kumar, et al., 2014). Numerous studies have shown that CTN exposure causes toxicity by affecting the immune system (Islam, et al., 2012; Sharma, 1993), liver, and kidneys (Phillips and Hayes, 1978). Combined treatment with OTA and CTN induced oxidative damage in the liver and kidneys (Rašić, et al., 2019). Combined treatment with OTA and CTN induced cytotoxicity in HEK 293 cells due to the accumulation of cells in the S and G2/M phases. A luciferase assay using the pmiR-RB-REPORT™ vector harboring the 3′ UTR of PDCD10 and CyclinG1 was used to examine miRNA-1-3p, hsa-miRNA-122-5p, and their target genes associated with apoptotic signaling and cell cycle proteins, namely programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) and cyclin G1 (CCNG1) (Gong, et al., 2019). Additionally, western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed their expression patterns, indicating that miRNA-target interactions may be responsible for mycotoxin-induced cell death (Gong, Zhu, Li, Ming, Duan, Wang and Jiang, 2019). Patulin is a secondary metabolite produced by more than 60 different fungi, including Penicillium and Aspergillus (Wright, 2015). It is commonly found in moldy vegetables and fruits such as apples (Mahato, et al., 2021). Several studies have reported that patulin causes significant renal toxicity (Lu, et al., 2017; Speijers, et al., 1988). Recently, patulin was shown to decrease miRNA-144 expression by activating the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 pathway in HEK 293 cells (Pillay, et al., 2021). In patulin-exposed HEK 293 cells, miRNA-27b inhibited with cytotoxicity (Pillay, et al., 2022). Mycotoxicity in rat testes occurs following exposure to the nonsteroidal estrogenic mycotoxin ZEA (Cheraghi, et al., 2015). Histopathology of ZEA-treated mice shows that injured germ cells, particularly spermatogonia and spermatocytes, gradually undergo apoptosis after treatment. OTA treatment induces cytotoxicity and enhanced Dicer and miRNA-122 expression in GC-2 cells, a spermatocyte-like cell line, while a miRNA-122 inhibitor suppressed apoptosis (Chen, et al., 2015). Zheng et al. demonstrated that ZEN stimulated the proliferation of mouse TM3 cells (Leydig cells), and miRNA deep sequencing analysis showed that miRNAs from ZEN-treated TM3 cells were differentially expressed and that the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway was targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs (Zheng, et al., 2019). Wang et al. also showed that the exposure of TM3 cells to ZEN significantly increased miRNA-467e-3p, miRNA-19a-3p miRNA-96-5p, and miRNA-221-5p expression, whereas decreased miRNA-146b-3p, miRNA-301a-5p, miRNA-210-5p, miRNA-3098-5p, miRNA-185-5p, miRNA-467e-3p, miRNA-441-5p, miRNA-410-3p, miRNA-195a-3p, miRNA-326-3p, miRNA-615-3p, and miRNA-96-3p expression (Wang, et al., 2019b). The target genes of miRNAs altered after ZEN exposure are involved in the PI3K-AKT, Ras, Ras-associated protein 1 (Rap1), and forkhead box (FoxO) signaling pathways (Wang, Wu, Li, He, Huang, Chen, Chen, Long, Yang and Li, 2019b). Xu et al. reported that ZEN decreases TM3 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and increases miRNA-96-5p levels. ZEN-induced loss of viability in TM3 cells can be recovered by blocking miRNA-96-5p, suggesting that miRNA-96-5p may be a useful biomarker of male infertility (Xu, et al., 2021). The functions of miRNAs in placental development have been documented (Awamleh, et al., 2019; Fu, et al., 2013). The placentas of patients with preeclampsia show lower levels of DICER, and DICER knockdown in trophoblasts inhibits the processing of miRNAs (Tang, et al., 2020). Cytotrophoblast proliferation is regulated by Dicer-dependent miRNAs (Forbes, et al., 2012). DROSHA expression increased significantly in the ovariectomized mouse uterus after progesterone therapy and caused stromal decidualization in a stromal cell culture model (Zhang, et al., 2016). ZEN and its metabolites can bind to estrogen receptors and are considered mycoestrogens (Ali and Degen, 2018). Placental miRNAs are differentially expressed when exposed to xenobiotics such as environmental pollutants (Li, et al., 2015). Andersen et al. showed that miRNAs such as mmu-miRNA-133b-5p and mmu-miRNA-7028-5p were differentially expressed in the placentas of mice treated with ZEN (Andersen, et al., 2020). Several studies have shown that mycotoxins cause pulmonary epithelial cell damage with lung inflammation. Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1) may be associated with lung carcinogenesis; it increases oxidative DNA damage in alveolar epithelial cells and generates inflammation through increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression (Shao, et al., 2019). OTA has also been reported to induce heart and lung damage in rats (Okutan, et al., 2004). Based on miRNA microarray analyses, Wang et al. demonstrated that miRNA expression was altered at passage 50 (P50) in B-2A13 cells (immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells stably expressing CYP2A13) treated with AFB1. MiRNA-138-1-3p contributes to AFB-induced malignant transformation of B-2A13 cells by inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, and migration of P50 B-2A13 cells (Wang, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Ji, Xu, Wang, Sun, Gao and Wang, 2016). CTN administration alters cardiac morphology and causes pericardial edema and heart malformation in zebrafish (Wu, et al., 2013). CTN treatment in zebrafish downregulated miRNA-138 and increased the expression of cardiac-related genes aldh1a2 and cspg2, the targets of miRNA-138. CTN-induced cardiac abnormalities were reversed by overexpression of miRNA-138, implying that CTN exposure harms heart development by altering heart morphogenesis through miRNA-138 dysregulation (Wu, Yang, Yu and Liu, 2013). AFB1 and OTA are the most potent mycotoxins affecting the liver and kidney, respectively. To identify signaling pathways associated with miRNAs regulated by AFB1 in the liver and OTA in the kidney, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using ShinyGO v0.76 (http: http://bioinformatics. sdstate. edu) (Ge, et al., 2020). A false discovery rate of 0.05 and an edge cut-off value of 0.3 were applied. In the resulting network visualization, node size denotes the number of genes associated with a specific function, whereas the color intensity represents the relevance of the relationship. Of the human miRNAs regulated by AFB1, hsa-miRNA-34a, hsa-miRNA-33a, hsa-miRNA-122, and hsa-miRNA-224 were selected on to determine the potential mechanism of aflatoxin in the liver. Using Shiny GO 0.76 (http://bioinformatics. sdstate. ed) (Ge, Jung and Yao, 2020), GO enrichment analyses of the targets of the aforementioned four miRNAs were used to identify the effect of miRNAs on cell differentiation, neurogenesis, generation of neurons, locomotion, cell development, and other processes (Figure 2). Aflatoxin affects the nervous system. Administration of AFB1 to rats causes neurotoxicity by degenerating the central and peripheral nervous systems (Ikegwuonu, 1983), as well as sciatic nerve degeneration in the myelin sheath (Makhlouf, 2020). AFB1 also alters locomotion and neurotoxic markers in zebrafish embryos and larvae (Wu, et al., 2019).Figure 2Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224 altered by aflatoxin B1 in the liver.

To determine the effect of OTA in the kidney, GO enrichment analyses of the targets of three miRNAs (miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, miRNA-200c) regulated in response to OTA were performed using Shiny GO 0.76 (http:bioinformatics.sdstate.edu). The analyses suggest that OTA regulates processes including neurogenesis, generation of neurons, neuron development, cell development, axon development, and regulation of cell differentiation (Figure 3). OTA induces neurotoxicity in human astrocytes by inhibiting proliferation (Park, et al., 2019). Furthermore, OTA induces apoptosis in neuronal cells, such as the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, and HT-22 cells (mouse hippocampal cell line) via oxidative stress (Yoon, et al., 2009). Therefore, AFB1 and OTA are associated with neurogenesis. Future studies should explore the relationship between mycotoxins and neurotoxicity.Figure 3Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, and miRNA-200c altered by ochratoxin A in the kidney.

Hub genes of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA have been identified using Cytoscape 3.7.2 and its plug-in CytoHubba (Chin, et al., 2014). This illustration depicts the importance of hubs using a color scale ranging from red (most important) to yellow (least significant) (p-value cut-off of 0.05). Ten hub genes from the targets of four miRNAs (hsa-miRNA-34a, hsa-miRNA-122, hsa-miRNA-33a, and hsa-miRNA-224) regulated by AFB1 were identified based on their degree of closeness (Figure 4A). The top 10 hub genes were notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), SRC proto-oncogene (SRC), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), disc large MAGUK scaffold protein 4 (DLG4), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG), SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3), and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1). AFB1 induces immunotoxicity via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (Zhou, et al., 2019). AFB1 regulates lung cancer cell migration by inducing Src phosphorylation (Cui, et al., 2015). AFB1 toxicity dysregulates PPARG and BCL expression in the liver of chickens (Liu, et al., 2020).Figure 4Predicted targets of microRNAs regulated by aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A.

Ten hub genes from the targets of three miRNAs (miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, miRNA-200c) regulated by OTA were identified according to the degree of closeness using Cytoscape and its plug-in CytoHubba (Figure 4B). The top 10 hub genes were mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), KRAS proto-oncogene (KRAS), jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (JUN), EGFR, MAPK1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), NOTCH1, E1A binding protein P300 (EP300), and VEGFA (Figure 4B). OTA treatment in HEK 293 cells enhances the expression of VEGF, a vascular permeability factor (Raghubeer, et al., 2019). Exposure of primary murine keratinocytes to non-cytotoxic doses of OTA regulates cell proliferation by activating EGFR, ERK1/2, p-AKT, and c-Jun (Kumar, et al., 2013). Therefore, VEGF and EGFR are shared targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA. VEGF and EGFR inhibitors have emerged as critical therapies in several tumors and other diseases (Tabernero, 2007; Wang, et al., 2017). We speculate that VEGF and EGFR inhibitors could be beneficial medications for toxin impact. In this study, the key differences in predicted targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA lie in the specific pathways and functions they regulate. The targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 includes genes involved in neurotrophic signaling (BDNF) (Yang, et al., 2023), cell adhesion (DLG4), metabolic regulation (PPARG) (Ahmadian, et al., 2013), and hormone signaling (ESR1) (Gui, et al., 2025). The target of miRNAs by OTA focuses on the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (MAPK3, KRAS, JUN, MAPK1) (Guo, et al., 2020), cell shape and migration (CDC42) (Álvarez-Aznar, et al., 2025), and chromatin remodeling (EP300) (Fasano, et al., 2023). NOTCH1, VEGFA, and EGFR are common miRNA targets that regulate both AFB1 and OTA. These proteins are important in transcription regulation, receptor activation, and oncogenic activity (Koveitypour, et al., 2019; Troy, et al., 2013)."

      "title": "microRNA biogenesis",
      "text": "Typically, nascent primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are converted into microRNAs (miRNAs) through two sequential cleavage events. miRNAs are produced by the miRNA biogenesis pathway, which involves multiple steps and numerous proteins and enzymes. The DGCR8 subunit of the Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessor complex first interacts with Drosha to process pri-miRNAs. Drosha then releases a hairpin-shaped precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), approximately 65 nucleotides long (Denli, et al., 2004; Pong and Gullerova, 2018). Exportin 5 transports the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm, where the RNase Dicer cleaves it to form a mature miRNA (approximately 22 nucleotides). The resulting small RNA duplex is loaded onto an Argonaute protein, where one strand is preferentially retained while the other is degraded. To target mRNAs for translational degradation or inhibition, one strand of mature miRNA is loaded onto complexes containing Argonaute (Macrae, et al., 2006). miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and responding to environmental stresses such as oxidative stress and DNA damage. They are implicated in many biological processes, including human diseases (Bottai, et al., 2014; Wang, et al., 2010) and drug resistance (Gomes, et al., 2016). In addition, miRNA expression profiles show that miRNAs are expressed in utero in response to various environmental factors, including xenochemicals (e.g., ethanol, bisphenol A, and gold nanoparticles), endogenous factors (e.g., hypoxia or oxidative stress), and certain nutritional states (e.g., high-fat diets) (Kappil and Chen, 2014). miRNAs have been used as diagnostic biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer. Because miRNAs are distinct biomarkers and detectable in the serum, saliva, and urine, they serve as valuable biological indicators for disease detection and prevention. miRNAs regulate gene transcription in eukaryotes and influence gene expression in mammals (Catalanotto, et al., 2016). Therefore, identifying miRNAs that inhibit the transcription and translation of disease-promoting genes is a promising strategy for disease prevention and control. While protein assays are commonly used for the early detection of mycotoxin pathogenicity, miRNA detection is often disregarded. miRNAs are found in tissues and body fluids, making diagnosis possible by identifying differentially expressed miRNAs. Moreover, their high sensitivity and specificity enable the detection of early-stage disorders and prediction of disease progression and drug resistance (Chen et al., 2022). miRNA interference has potential as a method to prevent mycotoxin toxicity. Mycotoxins are among the most prevalent food contaminants, and miRNAs have recently been reported to play a role in the body’s response to mycotoxins (Chen, Yang, Li, Wu, Nepovimova, Long, Wu and Kuca, 2022; Rong, et al., 2019). Therefore, understanding miRNAs may promote the identification of novel biomarkers for determining toxin exposure and disease risk. In this review, we summarize the effects of mycotoxins on miRNA expression in various organs and discuss the potential biological roles and targets of miRNAs regulated by two common toxins, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA). This review highlights miRNA targets associated with mycotoxin exposure, offering insights into mycotoxin-associated pathways and the identification of biomarkers for the detection, prevention, and management of mycotoxin-related diseases. AFB1 and OTA are emphasized because of their high toxicity, widespread occurrence in food and feed sources, and detrimental effects on both health and the economy."

      "text": "Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites generated by fungi that contaminate food and pose a global threat to human health and welfare (Milićević, et al., 2016). Several fungi, such as Aspergillus, Claviceps, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Alternaria, produce different mycotoxins (Steyn, 1995). Mycotoxins are found in animal feed and products as well as in food (Balázs and Schepers, 2007) and can affect multiple organs, particularly the digestive tract, including the colon (Gajęcka, et al., 2018), liver (Wang, et al., 2019c), esophagus (Yekeler, et al., 2001), stomach (Craddock, et al., 1987), and kidneys (Rumora, et al., 2007). Short-term exposure to high doses of mycotoxins causes acute toxicity that manifests as rapid-onset diarrhea, borborygmus, and abdominal pain (Liew and Mohd-Redzwan, 2018). Prolonged exposure to a low dose of mycotoxins can damage the immune and nervous systems, and adversely affect organs such as the kidneys, liver and colon (Gajęcka, Waśkiewicz, Zielonka, Goliński, Rykaczewska, Lisieska-Żołnierczyk and Gajęcki, 2018; Wang, Zhai, Xia, Wang, Ruan, Zhou, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Ren and Yang, 2019c). Mycotoxin exposure has also been associated with various illnesses and cancers, including esophageal carcinoma, obesity, and diabetes (Chen and Wu, 2017; Xue, et al., 2019). Several mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, OTA, and fumonisins, induce cellular stress and damage (Gómez-Osorio, et al., 2024), which can alter the expression profiles of miRNAs across various organs (Kappari, et al., 2024). Different mycotoxins target different organs, leading to distinct patterns of miRNA dysregulation. In the liver, AFB1-induced changes in miRNA expression can affect pathways related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and detoxification (Yang, et al., 2014). In the kidneys, OTA induces nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity by altering miRNA expression (Marin, et al., 2019). Mycotoxins influence miRNA expression through multiple mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of cellular processes and contributing to the etiology of liver and intestinal diseases. The specific miRNAs and molecular pathways affected vary depending on the type of mycotoxin and the target organ (Kappari, Dasireddy, Applegate, Selvaraj and Shanmugasundaram, 2024)."

      "text": "The liver is a major target organ for mycotoxins, where they undergo biotransformation and may cause significant damage (Wang, et al., 2023). Mycotoxins such as OTA and AFB1 are particularly well-studied for their effects on hepatic miRNA expression (Jorud, et al., 2024; Luo, et al., 2025). AFB1 is a potent human carcinogen with well-documented hepatotoxic effects (Long, et al., 2016; Shen and Ong, 1996). Exposure to AFB1 can induce cytotoxicity through the generation of reactive oxygen species and genetic alterations, especially in the p53 gene (Peroxisomes, 1995). AFB1 exposure has been shown to alter hepatic miRNA expression, leading to hepatotoxicity and increased risk of liver cancer (Yang, Lian, Feng, Srinivas, Guo, Zhong, Zhuang and Wang, 2014). For example, miRNA-24, modulated by AFB1, has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Liu, et al., 2014b). Additionally, AFB1 exposure upregulates miRNA-122 and miRNA-429, both of which are associated with liver damage and are considered potential biomarkers of liver injury (Livingstone, et al., 2017). In the kidneys, OTA induces nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity through oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and autophagy (Khoi, et al., 2021). OTA also alters miRNA expression profiles associated with renal function, leading to nephrotoxicity (Dai, et al., 2014) (Hennemeier, et al., 2014). OTA can decrease the level of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 via miR-132 and miR-200c, resulting in OTA toxicity (Stachurska, et al., 2013). Moreover, OTA-induced upregulation of miRNA-29b enhances collagen expression in human kidney cells (Hennemeier, Humpf, Gekle and Schwerdt, 2014). In the kidneys of OTA-intoxicated animal models, five miRNAs: miRNA-497, miRNA-133a-3p, miRNA-423-3p, miRNA-34a, and miRNA-542-3p, were upregulated. In contrast, three miRNAs (miRNA-421-3p, miRNA-490, and miRNA-9840-3p) were downregulated (Marin, Braicu, Dumitrescu, Pistol, Cojocneanu, Neagoe and Taranu, 2019). Mycotoxins can also affect the lungs, primarily through oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially leading to respiratory disorders (Huang, et al., 2024; Schütze, et al., 2010). Upregulation of miRNA-155 and a decreased BAX/BCL-2 ratio suggest either a tissue-specific response to OTA exposure or inhibition of TP53-dependent apoptosis in lung fibroblasts (Kharboush, et al., 2024). Additionally, miRNA-138-1 is implicated in AFB1-induced malignant transformation of B-2A13 cells by targeting phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (Wang, et al., 2016). In the intestine, mycotoxins, particularly deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins, are commonly found due to direct exposure from contaminated feed (Pierron, et al., 2016). These toxins can disrupt the intestinal barrier, resulting in inflammation and altered immune responses through changes in miRNA expression (Behrouzi, et al., 2020; Gao, et al., 2020; Gao, et al., 2023)."

IECs respond through the innate local immune response to reduce the threat of infection. Mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, ochratoxins, and zearalenone) affect overall host health through gut microbiota modulation (Liew and Mohd-Redzwan, 2018). miRNAs produced by host IECs modulate the microbiota (Liu, et al., 2016)."

Destruxins may function both as V-H+-ATPase inhibitors and calcium ionophores (Vázquez, et al., 2005). Additionally, destruxins possess cytotoxic, antiviral, anticancer, and herbicidal properties (Liu and Tzeng, 2012). Wu et al.

The liver contributes to detoxification and protection against foreign substances and toxic chemicals (Grant, 1991). When xenobiotics penetrate the body, it produces numerous enzymes that convert them into hydrophilic and polar compounds (Iyanagi, 2007). miRNAs are involved in various liver diseases, such as fibrosis, liver injury, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and HCC (Schueller, et al., 2018). In the liver, miRNA-122 regulates several genes related to hepatic cholesterol and lipid metabolism and is essential for maintaining homeostasis (Wen and Friedman, 2012). Inhibition of miRNA-122 using antisense approaches reduced plasma cholesterol levels in mice (Ma, et al., 2012). Several miRNAs have been found to play a role in liver fibrosis. Serum levels of miRNA-571 and miRNA-122 have been proposed to be potential biomarkers of liver fibrosis (Roderburg, et al., 2012; Waidmann, et al., 2012).

In developing countries, HCC accounts for more than 600,000 deaths (Parkin, 2006). Among aflatoxins, AFB1 is the most toxic aflatoxin and has been shown to induce tumors in the liver and other organs such as the colon and kidneys (Maxwell, 1998). In the nucleus, Drosha, an RNase III enzyme, and its cofactor DGCR8 convert pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs, which are then transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (Han, et al., 2004). Mycotoxins can disrupt these processes, potentially influencing the levels of mature miRNA (Gregory, et al., 2006). Reportedly, miRNA biogenesis-related genes, such as Drosha, Dicer, and DGCR8, are disrupted by AFB1 treatment in HepG2 cells (Yang, Lian, Feng, Srinivas, Guo, Zhong, Zhuang and Wang, 2014). Deep sequencing of rat liver tissue showed AFB1-induced hepatic injury and differentially expressed miRNAs; rno-miRNA-34a-5p was upregulated to assist in p53-mediated repair of DNA damage in the F344 rat liver after AFB1 exposure (Liu, et al., 2015). Several studies have shown differentially expressed miRNAs in AFB1-treated human liver cell lines (Marrone, et al., 2016; Zhu, et al., 2015). Marrone et al. (2016) demonstrated that miRNA-122 is inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to AFB1 treatment in HepaRG cells. AFB1-induced down-regulation of miR-122 was linked to suppression of the liver-enriched transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha and miR-122 regulation pathway. miRNA-33a levels were upregulated in HCC cells treated with AFB1 and treatment at IC50 decreased β-catenin expression, which affected the β-catenin pathway and inhibited cell growth (Fang, et al., 2013). Mycotoxins can influence this process by affecting the activity of transcription factors. For example, AFB1 can alter the expression of genes encoding transcription factors such as p53 that regulate miRNA transcription (Fang, Feng, Wu, Srinivas, Yang, Fan, Yang and Wang, 2013). Zhu et al. (2015) conducted miRNA profiling in HepG2 cells treated with AFB1 and found that miRNA-34a was upregulated. This upregulation occurred through multiple pathways, including activation of the p53 pathway, which directly regulates miR-34a transcription. Additionally, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was downregulated, indicating that AFB1 may upregulate miRNA-34a by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway."

The levels of Dicer, an endonuclease involved in miRNA processing, increased during OTA toxicity (Marin, Braicu, Dumitrescu, Pistol, Cojocneanu, Neagoe and Taranu, 2019). In patients with diabetes and obstructive nephropathy, Dicer deficiency in the proximal tubules increased inflammation, tubular cell death, and interstitial fibrosis, indicating the crucial role of Dicer and its link to miRNAs in the regulation of extracellular matrix accumulation and renal tubular injury (Ma, et al., 2018). Podocyte-specific deletion of Drosha, the core protein involved in miRNA processing, caused severe glomerulopathy (Zhdanova, et al., 2011). Several miRNAs, including miRNA-204, miRNA-215, miRNA-216, miRNA-192, and miRNA-194, are abundantly expressed in human kidneys (Sun, et al., 2004). miRNA-21 enhances kidney fibrosis by modulating metabolic pathways (Chau, et al., 2012).

Numerous studies have shown that OTA-induced nephrotoxicity is mediated by miRNAs. For example, treatment of HEK 293 cells with OTA resulted in toxicity and inhibited the expression of miRNA biogenesis genes, such as Dicer1, DGCR8, and Drosha (Zhao, Qi, Dai, He, Dweep, Guo, Luo, Gretz, Luo, Huang, and Xu, 2017). The levels of Dicer1 and Drosha, but not DGR8, are significantly downregulated in the kidneys after OTA administration, indicating impaired miRNA biogenesis (Dai, Zhao, Qi, Xu, He, Guo, Dweep, Cheng, Luo, Xia, Gretz and Huang, 2014). Similarly,Stachurska et al. showed that OTA treatment of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells regulated miRNA processing by enhancing Lin28 protein, DGCR-8, miRNA-132 and miRNA-200c expression (Stachurska, Ciesla, Kozakowska, Wolffram, Boesch-Saadatmandi, Rimbach, Jozkowicz, Dulak and Loboda, 2013). Furthermore, anti-miRNA-132 and anti-miRNA-200c blocked the OTA-mediated reduction in heme oxygenase-1 and the increase in reactive oxygen species production and TGF-β expression. OTA reportedly promotes collagen formation by downregulating miRNA-29b through reducing miRNA-29b levels in the cytoplasm (Hennemeier, Humpf, Gekle and Schwerdt, 2014). Dai et al. conducted miRNA profiling of OTA toxicity in rat kidneys and found miRNA-129, miRNA-130a, miRNA-218b, miRNA-130b, miRNA-141, and miRNA-3588 to be suppressed in medium-dose OTA-treated rat kidneys but upregulated by high-dose OTA treatments (Dai, Zhao, Qi, Xu, He, Guo, Dweep, Cheng, Luo, Xia, Gretz and Huang, 2014).

OTA treatment induces cytotoxicity and enhanced Dicer and miRNA-122 expression in GC-2 cells, a spermatocyte-like cell line, while a miRNA-122 inhibitor suppressed apoptosis (Chen, et al., 2015). Zheng et al. demonstrated that ZEN stimulated the proliferation of mouse TM3 cells (Leydig cells), and miRNA deep sequencing analysis showed that miRNAs from ZEN-treated TM3 cells were differentially expressed and that the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway was targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs (Zheng, et al., 2019). Wang et al. also showed that the exposure of TM3 cells to ZEN significantly increased miRNA-467e-3p, miRNA-19a-3p miRNA-96-5p, and miRNA-221-5p expression, whereas decreased miRNA-146b-3p, miRNA-301a-5p, miRNA-210-5p, miRNA-3098-5p, miRNA-185-5p, miRNA-467e-3p, miRNA-441-5p, miRNA-410-3p, miRNA-195a-3p, miRNA-326-3p, miRNA-615-3p, and miRNA-96-3p expression (Wang, et al., 2019b).

Xu et al. reported that ZEN decreases TM3 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and increases miRNA-96-5p levels.

To identify signaling pathways associated with miRNAs regulated by AFB1 in the liver and OTA in the kidney, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using ShinyGO v0.76 (http: http://bioinformatics. sdstate. edu) (Ge, et al., 2020). A false discovery rate of 0.05 and an edge cut-off value of 0.3 were applied. In the resulting network visualization, node size denotes the number of genes associated with a specific function, whereas the color intensity represents the relevance of the relationship. Of the human miRNAs regulated by AFB1, hsa-miRNA-34a, hsa-miRNA-33a, hsa-miRNA-122, and hsa-miRNA-224 were selected on to determine the potential mechanism of aflatoxin in the liver. Using Shiny GO 0.76 (http://bioinformatics. sdstate. ed) (Ge, Jung and Yao, 2020), GO enrichment analyses of the targets of the aforementioned four miRNAs were used to identify the effect of miRNAs on cell differentiation, neurogenesis, generation of neurons, locomotion, cell development, and other processes (Figure 2). Aflatoxin affects the nervous system. Administration of AFB1 to rats causes neurotoxicity by degenerating the central and peripheral nervous systems (Ikegwuonu, 1983), as well as sciatic nerve degeneration in the myelin sheath (Makhlouf, 2020). AFB1 also alters locomotion and neurotoxic markers in zebrafish embryos and larvae (Wu, et al., 2019).Figure 2Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224 altered by aflatoxin B1 in the liver.

OTA treatment in HEK 293 cells enhances the expression of VEGF, a vascular permeability factor (Raghubeer, et al., 2019). Exposure of primary murine keratinocytes to non-cytotoxic doses of OTA regulates cell proliferation by activating EGFR, ERK1/2, p-AKT, and c-Jun (Kumar, et al., 2013). Therefore, VEGF and EGFR are shared targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA. VEGF and EGFR inhibitors have emerged as critical therapies in several tumors and other diseases (Tabernero, 2007; Wang, et al., 2017). We speculate that VEGF and EGFR inhibitors could be beneficial medications for toxin impact. In this study, the key differences in predicted targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA lie in the specific pathways and functions they regulate. The targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 includes genes involved in neurotrophic signaling (BDNF) (Yang, et al., 2023), cell adhesion (DLG4), metabolic regulation (PPARG) (Ahmadian, et al., 2013), and hormone signaling (ESR1) (Gui, et al., 2025). The target of miRNAs by OTA focuses on the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (MAPK3, KRAS, JUN, MAPK1) (Guo, et al., 2020), cell shape and migration (CDC42) (Álvarez-Aznar, et al., 2025), and chromatin remodeling (EP300) (Fasano, et al., 2023). NOTCH1, VEGFA, and EGFR are common miRNA targets that regulate both AFB1 and OTA.

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "In this review, we summarized the role of miRNAs regulated in response to mycotoxins in several important organs, as well as the potential functions of miRNAs affected by AFB1 and OTA. The predicted biological roles of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA are strongly associated with neurotoxic effects. In addition, the potential co-targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA include VEGFA, EGFR, and NOTCH1. miRNAs are valuable for disease identification and prevention due to their role as distinctive biomarkers measurable in serum, saliva, and urine (Condrat, et al., 2020). Moreover, miRNA expression profiles can change in response to disease, providing a specific signature that can distinguish between healthy and diseased states. Despite this potential, a number of obstacles prevent miRNAs from being widely used in clinical settings as diagnostic biomarkers. One major obstacle is the standardization of pre-analytical and analytical procedures. Another challenge is the need for robust and validated detection methods (de Gonzalo-Calvo, et al., 2022). Although several methods, such as next-generation sequencing, microarray analysis, and quantitative real-time PCR are available, each method has limitations in terms of cost, sensitivity, specificity, and usability in a clinical context (Condrat, Thompson, Barbu, Bugnar, Boboc, Cretoiu, Suciu, Cretoiu and Voinea, 2020). Currently, while research continues to advance, miRNAs are not yet widely used as routine diagnostic markers in clinical practice. However, several miRNA-based diagnostic tests are currently under development or in clinical trials for specific diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders (Chakraborty, et al., 2021; Kim and Croce, 2023). Due to the widespread health hazards and economic burdens associated with mycotoxin exposure in both humans and animals, novel prognostic tools or strategies are crucial for the detection, prevention, and control of mycotoxin-associated problems. Therefore, this review serves as a resource for researchers and scientists working on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying mycotoxin toxicity and developing targeted interventions to prevent and control mycotoxin-related diseases."

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nTypically, nascent primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are converted into microRNAs (miRNAs) through two sequential cleavage events. miRNAs are produced by the miRNA biogenesis pathway, which involves multiple steps and numerous proteins and enzymes. The DGCR8 subunit of the Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessor complex first interacts with Drosha to process pri-miRNAs. Drosha then releases a hairpin-shaped precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), approximately 65 nucleotides long (Denli, et al., 2004; Pong and Gullerova, 2018). Exportin 5 transports the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm, where the RNase Dicer cleaves it to form a mature miRNA (approximately 22 nucleotides). The resulting small RNA duplex is loaded onto an Argonaute protein, where one strand is preferentially retained while the other is degraded. To target mRNAs for translational degradation or inhibition, one strand of mature miRNA is loaded onto complexes containing Argonaute (Macrae, et al., 2006). miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and responding to environmental stresses such as oxidative stress and DNA damage. They are implicated in many biological processes, including human diseases (Bottai, et al., 2014; Wang, et al., 2010) and drug resistance (Gomes, et al., 2016). In addition, miRNA expression profiles show that miRNAs are expressed in utero in response to various environmental factors, including xenochemicals (e.g., ethanol, bisphenol A, and gold nanoparticles), endogenous factors (e.g., hypoxia or oxidative stress), and certain nutritional states (e.g., high-fat diets) (Kappil and Chen, 2014). miRNAs have been used as diagnostic biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer. Because miRNAs are distinct biomarkers and detectable in the serum, saliva, and urine, they serve as valuable biological indicators for disease detection and prevention. miRNAs regulate gene transcription in eukaryotes and influence gene expression in mammals (Catalanotto, et al., 2016). Therefore, identifying miRNAs that inhibit the transcription and translation of disease-promoting genes is a promising strategy for disease prevention and control. While protein assays are commonly used for the early detection of mycotoxin pathogenicity, miRNA detection is often disregarded. miRNAs are found in tissues and body fluids, making diagnosis possible by identifying differentially expressed miRNAs. Moreover, their high sensitivity and specificity enable the detection of early-stage disorders and prediction of disease progression and drug resistance (Chen et al., 2022). miRNA interference has potential as a method to prevent mycotoxin toxicity. Mycotoxins are among the most prevalent food contaminants, and miRNAs have recently been reported to play a role in the body’s response to mycotoxins (Chen, Yang, Li, Wu, Nepovimova, Long, Wu and Kuca, 2022; Rong, et al., 2019). Therefore, understanding miRNAs may promote the identification of novel biomarkers for determining toxin exposure and disease risk. In this review, we summarize the effects of mycotoxins on miRNA expression in various organs and discuss the potential biological roles and targets of miRNAs regulated by two common toxins, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA). This review highlights miRNA targets associated with mycotoxin exposure, offering insights into mycotoxin-associated pathways and the identification of biomarkers for the detection, prevention, and management of mycotoxin-related diseases. AFB1 and OTA are emphasized because of their high toxicity, widespread occurrence in food and feed sources, and detrimental effects on both health and the economy. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites generated by fungi that contaminate food and pose a global threat to human health and welfare (Milićević, et al., 2016). Several fungi, such as Aspergillus, Claviceps, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Alternaria, produce different mycotoxins (Steyn, 1995). Mycotoxins are found in animal feed and products as well as in food (Balázs and Schepers, 2007) and can affect multiple organs, particularly the digestive tract, including the colon (Gajęcka, et al., 2018), liver (Wang, et al., 2019c), esophagus (Yekeler, et al., 2001), stomach (Craddock, et al., 1987), and kidneys (Rumora, et al., 2007). Short-term exposure to high doses of mycotoxins causes acute toxicity that manifests as rapid-onset diarrhea, borborygmus, and abdominal pain (Liew and Mohd-Redzwan, 2018). Prolonged exposure to a low dose of mycotoxins can damage the immune and nervous systems, and adversely affect organs such as the kidneys, liver and colon (Gajęcka, Waśkiewicz, Zielonka, Goliński, Rykaczewska, Lisieska-Żołnierczyk and Gajęcki, 2018; Wang, Zhai, Xia, Wang, Ruan, Zhou, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Ren and Yang, 2019c). Mycotoxin exposure has also been associated with various illnesses and cancers, including esophageal carcinoma, obesity, and diabetes (Chen and Wu, 2017; Xue, et al., 2019). Several mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, OTA, and fumonisins, induce cellular stress and damage (Gómez-Osorio, et al., 2024), which can alter the expression profiles of miRNAs across various organs (Kappari, et al., 2024). Different mycotoxins target different organs, leading to distinct patterns of miRNA dysregulation. In the liver, AFB1-induced changes in miRNA expression can affect pathways related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and detoxification (Yang, et al., 2014). In the kidneys, OTA induces nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity by altering miRNA expression (Marin, et al., 2019). Mycotoxins influence miRNA expression through multiple mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of cellular processes and contributing to the etiology of liver and intestinal diseases. The specific miRNAs and molecular pathways affected vary depending on the type of mycotoxin and the target organ (Kappari, Dasireddy, Applegate, Selvaraj and Shanmugasundaram, 2024). The liver is a major target organ for mycotoxins, where they undergo biotransformation and may cause significant damage (Wang, et al., 2023). Mycotoxins such as OTA and AFB1 are particularly well-studied for their effects on hepatic miRNA expression (Jorud, et al., 2024; Luo, et al., 2025). AFB1 is a potent human carcinogen with well-documented hepatotoxic effects (Long, et al., 2016; Shen and Ong, 1996). Exposure to AFB1 can induce cytotoxicity through the generation of reactive oxygen species and genetic alterations, especially in the p53 gene (Peroxisomes, 1995). AFB1 exposure has been shown to alter hepatic miRNA expression, leading to hepatotoxicity and increased risk of liver cancer (Yang, Lian, Feng, Srinivas, Guo, Zhong, Zhuang and Wang, 2014). For example, miRNA-24, modulated by AFB1, has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Liu, et al., 2014b). Additionally, AFB1 exposure upregulates miRNA-122 and miRNA-429, both of which are associated with liver damage and are considered potential biomarkers of liver injury (Livingstone, et al., 2017). In the kidneys, OTA induces nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity through oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and autophagy (Khoi, et al., 2021). OTA also alters miRNA expression profiles associated with renal function, leading to nephrotoxicity (Dai, et al., 2014) (Hennemeier, et al., 2014). OTA can decrease the level of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 via miR-132 and miR-200c, resulting in OTA toxicity (Stachurska, et al., 2013). Moreover, OTA-induced upregulation of miRNA-29b enhances collagen expression in human kidney cells (Hennemeier, Humpf, Gekle and Schwerdt, 2014). In the kidneys of OTA-intoxicated animal models, five miRNAs: miRNA-497, miRNA-133a-3p, miRNA-423-3p, miRNA-34a, and miRNA-542-3p, were upregulated. In contrast, three miRNAs (miRNA-421-3p, miRNA-490, and miRNA-9840-3p) were downregulated (Marin, Braicu, Dumitrescu, Pistol, Cojocneanu, Neagoe and Taranu, 2019). Mycotoxins can also affect the lungs, primarily through oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially leading to respiratory disorders (Huang, et al., 2024; Schütze, et al., 2010). Upregulation of miRNA-155 and a decreased BAX/BCL-2 ratio suggest either a tissue-specific response to OTA exposure or inhibition of TP53-dependent apoptosis in lung fibroblasts (Kharboush, et al., 2024). Additionally, miRNA-138-1 is implicated in AFB1-induced malignant transformation of B-2A13 cells by targeting phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (Wang, et al., 2016). In the intestine, mycotoxins, particularly deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins, are commonly found due to direct exposure from contaminated feed (Pierron, et al., 2016). These toxins can disrupt the intestinal barrier, resulting in inflammation and altered immune responses through changes in miRNA expression (Behrouzi, et al., 2020; Gao, et al., 2020; Gao, et al., 2023). The gut microbiota affects the digestive and immune systems and defends the host against mycotoxicity (Bouhet and Oswald, 2005). Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are exposed to significant doses of food‐associated contaminants, including mycotoxins, depending on their location (Bouhet and Oswald, 2005). IECs respond through the innate local immune response to reduce the threat of infection. Mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, ochratoxins, and zearalenone) affect overall host health through gut microbiota modulation (Liew and Mohd-Redzwan, 2018). miRNAs produced by host IECs modulate the microbiota (Liu, et al., 2016). Metarhizium anisopliae, an entomopathogenic fungus, secretes destruxins as secondary metabolites (Wang, et al., 2004). Destruxins exhibit insecticidal activity against a variety of pests, with modes of action including contact toxicity, gut toxicity, antifeedant effects, ovicidal effects, and oviposition-deterrence (Sowjanya Sree, et al., 2008). Destruxins may function both as V-H+-ATPase inhibitors and calcium ionophores (Vázquez, et al., 2005). Additionally, destruxins possess cytotoxic, antiviral, anticancer, and herbicidal properties (Liu and Tzeng, 2012). Wu et al. (2018) showed that combined treatment with destruxin and the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil synergistically suppressed the viability of colon cancer cells and reduced tumorigenesis in 5-fluorouracil-resistant colon cells by increasing miRNA-214 and downregulating β-catenin and the mammalian target of rapamycin (Wu, et al., 2018). Food and feed supplies are frequently contaminated with alternariol (AOH) produced by Alternaria species. AOH is an emerging mycotoxin with documented negative effects and toxicological risk assessment (Gruber-Dorninger, et al., 2017). AOH has the potential for endocrine disruption, genotoxicity, pro-oxidation activity, and immunomodulation (Kollarova, et al., 2018; Kowalska, et al., 2021; Lehmann, et al., 2006; Tiessen, et al., 2013). Moreover, AOH may affect cell membrane characteristics critical to the innate immune response (Del Favero, et al., 2020). Schmutz et al. (2019) showed that AOH regulates interleukin‐1β‐induced inflammatory responses in differentiated Caco‐2 cells, with induction of miRNA‐16 and miRNA‐125b at 40 µM, suggesting that AOH impacts the immune response at the intestinal barrier (Schmutz, et al., 2019). Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites generated by fungi such as Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. These toxins are common contaminants of a wide range of crops, including tree nuts and cereals (Kumar, et al., 2021). The most common and dangerous of these toxins is AFB1 (Kumar, et al., 2016). Aflatoxin M1, the primary hydroxylated metabolite of AFB1, is also a major concern because it is found in the milk (hence, designation M) of mammals that consume contaminated feedstuff (Marchese, et al., 2018). AFB1 and aflatoxin M1 reduce cell viability in the NCM460 colon epithelial cell line via miRNA-628-3p- and miRNA-217-5p-mediated regulation of cell surface death receptors, as well as miRNA-11y-mediated regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Gao, et al., 2022). Zearalenone (ZEN) and DON are generated by Fusarium species in food products and feeds. In mice, ZEN causes toxicity in the intestine by suppressing immunity (Liu, et al., 2014a). DON, which is found in grains, is one of the most abundant trichothecenes (Mishra, et al., 2020). DON has been reported to have harmful effects on humans and other animals. Pigs exposed to DON exhibit reduced feed consumption as the initial negative consequence; they also show poor immune function, reproductive health, and growth performance (Pierron, Alassane-Kpembi and Oswald, 2016; Reddy, et al., 2018b). Pigs consuming a DON-contaminated diet experience epithelial lesions in the intestine and stomach, along with intestinal inflammation (Pierron, Alassane-Kpembi and Oswald, 2016; Reddy, et al., 2018a). DON has been associated with gut microbiota disruption through the induction of immunotoxicity (Liao, et al., 2018). On exposure to ZEN, porcine IECs showed altered expression profiles of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs (Wang, et al., 2019a). Mycotoxins are metabolized primarily in the liver (Matsuda, et al., 2013; Zöllner, et al., 2002). The liver contributes to detoxification and protection against foreign substances and toxic chemicals (Grant, 1991). When xenobiotics penetrate the body, it produces numerous enzymes that convert them into hydrophilic and polar compounds (Iyanagi, 2007). miRNAs are involved in various liver diseases, such as fibrosis, liver injury, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and HCC (Schueller, et al., 2018). In the liver, miRNA-122 regulates several genes related to hepatic cholesterol and lipid metabolism and is essential for maintaining homeostasis (Wen and Friedman, 2012). Inhibition of miRNA-122 using antisense approaches reduced plasma cholesterol levels in mice (Ma, et al., 2012). Several miRNAs have been found to play a role in liver fibrosis. Serum levels of miRNA-571 and miRNA-122 have been proposed to be potential biomarkers of liver fibrosis (Roderburg, et al., 2012; Waidmann, et al., 2012). Figure 1 summarizes the regulation of miRNAs by mycotoxins in the liver.Figure 1The effect of mycotoxins on miRNA regulation in the liver. The regulation of miRNA by mycotoxin in the liver. Schematic illustration showing the upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue) of miRNAs in liver cells after mycotoxin treatment.Figure 1 The effect of mycotoxins on miRNA regulation in the liver. The regulation of miRNA by mycotoxin in the liver. Schematic illustration showing the upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue) of miRNAs in liver cells after mycotoxin treatment. Aflatoxins, produced by A. flavus, are potent liver toxins, and their presence in food is a major risk factor for HCC (Lin, et al., 2005). In developing countries, HCC accounts for more than 600,000 deaths (Parkin, 2006). Among aflatoxins, AFB1 is the most toxic aflatoxin and has been shown to induce tumors in the liver and other organs such as the colon and kidneys (Maxwell, 1998). In the nucleus, Drosha, an RNase III enzyme, and its cofactor DGCR8 convert pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs, which are then transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (Han, et al., 2004). Mycotoxins can disrupt these processes, potentially influencing the levels of mature miRNA (Gregory, et al., 2006). Reportedly, miRNA biogenesis-related genes, such as Drosha, Dicer, and DGCR8, are disrupted by AFB1 treatment in HepG2 cells (Yang, Lian, Feng, Srinivas, Guo, Zhong, Zhuang and Wang, 2014). Deep sequencing of rat liver tissue showed AFB1-induced hepatic injury and differentially expressed miRNAs; rno-miRNA-34a-5p was upregulated to assist in p53-mediated repair of DNA damage in the F344 rat liver after AFB1 exposure (Liu, et al., 2015). Several studies have shown differentially expressed miRNAs in AFB1-treated human liver cell lines (Marrone, et al., 2016; Zhu, et al., 2015). Marrone et al. (2016) demonstrated that miRNA-122 is inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to AFB1 treatment in HepaRG cells. AFB1-induced down-regulation of miR-122 was linked to suppression of the liver-enriched transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha and miR-122 regulation pathway. miRNA-33a levels were upregulated in HCC cells treated with AFB1 and treatment at IC50 decreased β-catenin expression, which affected the β-catenin pathway and inhibited cell growth (Fang, et al., 2013). Mycotoxins can influence this process by affecting the activity of transcription factors. For example, AFB1 can alter the expression of genes encoding transcription factors such as p53 that regulate miRNA transcription (Fang, Feng, Wu, Srinivas, Yang, Fan, Yang and Wang, 2013). Zhu et al. (2015) conducted miRNA profiling in HepG2 cells treated with AFB1 and found that miRNA-34a was upregulated. This upregulation occurred through multiple pathways, including activation of the p53 pathway, which directly regulates miR-34a transcription. Additionally, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was downregulated, indicating that AFB1 may upregulate miRNA-34a by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Alternaria mycotoxins, such as alternariol (AOH) or altertoxin II (ATX II), are produced by Alternaria spp. These mycotoxins are common food and feed pollutants known for their immunomodulatory properties (Groestlinger, et al., 2022; Schmutz, Cenk and Marko, 2019). Combined treatment of AOH and ATX II induced cytotoxicity in the HCC cell line HepG2 (Vejdovszky, et al., 2017). A microarray study of the expression profiles of miRNAs in HepG2 cells showed that miRNA-4654, miRNA-6720-3p, and miRNA-4715-3p were upregulated by AOH, while miRNA-5583-5p was downregulated following ATX II treatment (Vejdovszky, Sack, Jarolim, Aichinger, Somoza and Marko, 2017). In addition, digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that miRNA-29a was significantly upregulated by AOH alone or in combination with ATX II after 24 h (Vejdovszky, Sack, Jarolim, Aichinger, Somoza and Marko, 2017). Isolated from endophytic fungi abundant in the traditional Chinese medicine herb Artemisia annua, myrothecine A was produced by extracts of Myrothecium roridum strain IFB-E012 (Shen, et al., 2015). Myrothecine A exerts anti-proliferative effects in the human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (Song, et al., 2019). In addition, Fu et al. showed that myrothecine A inhibited cell growth by modulating miRNA-221 in SMMC-7721 cells, indicating its potential use as an antitumor drug for HCC. While myrothecin A could override the inhibitory effect of miR-221 on dendritic cell development, miR-221 controlled dendritic cell maturation in the microenvironment of hepatoma cells (Fu, et al., 2019). OTA, the most prevalent mycotoxin among ochratoxins A, B, and C, is a secondary metabolite generated by Aspergillus and Penicillium (van der Merwe, et al., 1965). OTA causes liver inflammation in humans and other animals (Wang, Zhai, Xia, Wang, Ruan, Zhou, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Ren and Yang, 2019c). Lower doses of OTA do not cause noticeable pathological alterations, however, several early hepatotoxicity investigations using relatively high concentrations of OTA have revealed its ability to cause liver lesions (Aydin, et al., 2003; Ferrante, et al., 2006; Qi, et al., 2014; Rached, et al., 2007). Several studies have shown that OTA regulates liver miRNAs, both in vitro and in vivo (Qi, Yang, Chen, He, Dweep, Guo, Cheng, Xu, Luo, Gretz, Dai and Huang, 2014; Zhao, et al., 2017). HepG2 cells exposed to OTA showed upregulated miRNA-122, the most abundant miRNA in the mammalian liver, and HepG2 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Zhu, et al., 2016). Fumonisin is found in animal feed, human food products, and cereal grains (Knutsen, et al., 2018). Among fumonisins, fumonisin B1 (FB1), FB2, and FB3 are the most abundant and can regulate sphingolipid biosynthesis (Martinova and Merrill 1995; Reisinger, et al., 2016). FB1 is the most toxic fumonisin and has been implicated in HCC and liver tumors in rodents (Gelderblom, et al., 2008). FB1 affects the expression of cell cycle-related genes, including cyclin E and p21 (Wang et al., 2013). FB1 treatment of HepG2 cells significantly inhibited miRNA-27b expression and upregulated human cytochrome P450, a metabolic activator of many procarcinogens (Chuturgoon, et al., 2014). miRNAs play an essential role in kidney development and function (Zhao, et al., 2020). The levels of Dicer, an endonuclease involved in miRNA processing, increased during OTA toxicity (Marin, Braicu, Dumitrescu, Pistol, Cojocneanu, Neagoe and Taranu, 2019). In patients with diabetes and obstructive nephropathy, Dicer deficiency in the proximal tubules increased inflammation, tubular cell death, and interstitial fibrosis, indicating the crucial role of Dicer and its link to miRNAs in the regulation of extracellular matrix accumulation and renal tubular injury (Ma, et al., 2018). Podocyte-specific deletion of Drosha, the core protein involved in miRNA processing, caused severe glomerulopathy (Zhdanova, et al., 2011). Several miRNAs, including miRNA-204, miRNA-215, miRNA-216, miRNA-192, and miRNA-194, are abundantly expressed in human kidneys (Sun, et al., 2004). miRNA-21 enhances kidney fibrosis by modulating metabolic pathways (Chau, et al., 2012). Therefore, miRNAs are important in kidney function. OTA is the most prevalent mycotoxin and one of the most potent nephrotoxins and renal carcinogens in mammals (Pfohl-Leszkowicz and Manderville, 2007). Numerous studies have shown that OTA-induced nephrotoxicity is mediated by miRNAs. For example, treatment of HEK 293 cells with OTA resulted in toxicity and inhibited the expression of miRNA biogenesis genes, such as Dicer1, DGCR8, and Drosha (Zhao, Qi, Dai, He, Dweep, Guo, Luo, Gretz, Luo, Huang, and Xu, 2017). The levels of Dicer1 and Drosha, but not DGR8, are significantly downregulated in the kidneys after OTA administration, indicating impaired miRNA biogenesis (Dai, Zhao, Qi, Xu, He, Guo, Dweep, Cheng, Luo, Xia, Gretz and Huang, 2014). Similarly,Stachurska et al. showed that OTA treatment of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells regulated miRNA processing by enhancing Lin28 protein, DGCR-8, miRNA-132 and miRNA-200c expression (Stachurska, Ciesla, Kozakowska, Wolffram, Boesch-Saadatmandi, Rimbach, Jozkowicz, Dulak and Loboda, 2013). Furthermore, anti-miRNA-132 and anti-miRNA-200c blocked the OTA-mediated reduction in heme oxygenase-1 and the increase in reactive oxygen species production and TGF-β expression. OTA reportedly promotes collagen formation by downregulating miRNA-29b through reducing miRNA-29b levels in the cytoplasm (Hennemeier, Humpf, Gekle and Schwerdt, 2014). Dai et al. conducted miRNA profiling of OTA toxicity in rat kidneys and found miRNA-129, miRNA-130a, miRNA-218b, miRNA-130b, miRNA-141, and miRNA-3588 to be suppressed in medium-dose OTA-treated rat kidneys but upregulated by high-dose OTA treatments (Dai, Zhao, Qi, Xu, He, Guo, Dweep, Cheng, Luo, Xia, Gretz and Huang, 2014). Marin et al., (2019) conducted miRNA profiling of kidneys from piglets fed different doses of OTA-contaminated feed and found elevated levels of miRNA-497, miRNA-133a-3p, miRNA-423-3p, miRNA-34a, miRNA-542-3p, miRNA-490, and miRNA-9840-3p in the kidneys of OTA-treated piglets compared to those of the controls. Citrinin (CTN), produced by the genera Penicillium, Monascus, and Aspergillus, occurs in vegetable-based foods (de Oliveira Filho, et al., 2017). It is a fungal secondary metabolite and a polyketide nephrotoxic mycotoxin that is found in food and feed worldwide and is most common in stored grains (Čulig, et al., 2017). Modest doses of OTA and CTN, alone or in combination, caused lipid peroxidation and time-dependent apoptosis in rabbit kidneys (Kumar, et al., 2014). Numerous studies have shown that CTN exposure causes toxicity by affecting the immune system (Islam, et al., 2012; Sharma, 1993), liver, and kidneys (Phillips and Hayes, 1978). Combined treatment with OTA and CTN induced oxidative damage in the liver and kidneys (Rašić, et al., 2019). Combined treatment with OTA and CTN induced cytotoxicity in HEK 293 cells due to the accumulation of cells in the S and G2/M phases. A luciferase assay using the pmiR-RB-REPORT™ vector harboring the 3′ UTR of PDCD10 and CyclinG1 was used to examine miRNA-1-3p, hsa-miRNA-122-5p, and their target genes associated with apoptotic signaling and cell cycle proteins, namely programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) and cyclin G1 (CCNG1) (Gong, et al., 2019). Additionally, western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed their expression patterns, indicating that miRNA-target interactions may be responsible for mycotoxin-induced cell death (Gong, Zhu, Li, Ming, Duan, Wang and Jiang, 2019). Patulin is a secondary metabolite produced by more than 60 different fungi, including Penicillium and Aspergillus (Wright, 2015). It is commonly found in moldy vegetables and fruits such as apples (Mahato, et al., 2021). Several studies have reported that patulin causes significant renal toxicity (Lu, et al., 2017; Speijers, et al., 1988). Recently, patulin was shown to decrease miRNA-144 expression by activating the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 pathway in HEK 293 cells (Pillay, et al., 2021). In patulin-exposed HEK 293 cells, miRNA-27b inhibited with cytotoxicity (Pillay, et al., 2022). Mycotoxicity in rat testes occurs following exposure to the nonsteroidal estrogenic mycotoxin ZEA (Cheraghi, et al., 2015). Histopathology of ZEA-treated mice shows that injured germ cells, particularly spermatogonia and spermatocytes, gradually undergo apoptosis after treatment. OTA treatment induces cytotoxicity and enhanced Dicer and miRNA-122 expression in GC-2 cells, a spermatocyte-like cell line, while a miRNA-122 inhibitor suppressed apoptosis (Chen, et al., 2015). Zheng et al. demonstrated that ZEN stimulated the proliferation of mouse TM3 cells (Leydig cells), and miRNA deep sequencing analysis showed that miRNAs from ZEN-treated TM3 cells were differentially expressed and that the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway was targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs (Zheng, et al., 2019). Wang et al. also showed that the exposure of TM3 cells to ZEN significantly increased miRNA-467e-3p, miRNA-19a-3p miRNA-96-5p, and miRNA-221-5p expression, whereas decreased miRNA-146b-3p, miRNA-301a-5p, miRNA-210-5p, miRNA-3098-5p, miRNA-185-5p, miRNA-467e-3p, miRNA-441-5p, miRNA-410-3p, miRNA-195a-3p, miRNA-326-3p, miRNA-615-3p, and miRNA-96-3p expression (Wang, et al., 2019b). The target genes of miRNAs altered after ZEN exposure are involved in the PI3K-AKT, Ras, Ras-associated protein 1 (Rap1), and forkhead box (FoxO) signaling pathways (Wang, Wu, Li, He, Huang, Chen, Chen, Long, Yang and Li, 2019b). Xu et al. reported that ZEN decreases TM3 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and increases miRNA-96-5p levels. ZEN-induced loss of viability in TM3 cells can be recovered by blocking miRNA-96-5p, suggesting that miRNA-96-5p may be a useful biomarker of male infertility (Xu, et al., 2021). The functions of miRNAs in placental development have been documented (Awamleh, et al., 2019; Fu, et al., 2013). The placentas of patients with preeclampsia show lower levels of DICER, and DICER knockdown in trophoblasts inhibits the processing of miRNAs (Tang, et al., 2020). Cytotrophoblast proliferation is regulated by Dicer-dependent miRNAs (Forbes, et al., 2012). DROSHA expression increased significantly in the ovariectomized mouse uterus after progesterone therapy and caused stromal decidualization in a stromal cell culture model (Zhang, et al., 2016). ZEN and its metabolites can bind to estrogen receptors and are considered mycoestrogens (Ali and Degen, 2018). Placental miRNAs are differentially expressed when exposed to xenobiotics such as environmental pollutants (Li, et al., 2015). Andersen et al. showed that miRNAs such as mmu-miRNA-133b-5p and mmu-miRNA-7028-5p were differentially expressed in the placentas of mice treated with ZEN (Andersen, et al., 2020). Several studies have shown that mycotoxins cause pulmonary epithelial cell damage with lung inflammation. Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1) may be associated with lung carcinogenesis; it increases oxidative DNA damage in alveolar epithelial cells and generates inflammation through increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression (Shao, et al., 2019). OTA has also been reported to induce heart and lung damage in rats (Okutan, et al., 2004). Based on miRNA microarray analyses, Wang et al. demonstrated that miRNA expression was altered at passage 50 (P50) in B-2A13 cells (immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells stably expressing CYP2A13) treated with AFB1. MiRNA-138-1-3p contributes to AFB-induced malignant transformation of B-2A13 cells by inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, and migration of P50 B-2A13 cells (Wang, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Ji, Xu, Wang, Sun, Gao and Wang, 2016). CTN administration alters cardiac morphology and causes pericardial edema and heart malformation in zebrafish (Wu, et al., 2013). CTN treatment in zebrafish downregulated miRNA-138 and increased the expression of cardiac-related genes aldh1a2 and cspg2, the targets of miRNA-138. CTN-induced cardiac abnormalities were reversed by overexpression of miRNA-138, implying that CTN exposure harms heart development by altering heart morphogenesis through miRNA-138 dysregulation (Wu, Yang, Yu and Liu, 2013). AFB1 and OTA are the most potent mycotoxins affecting the liver and kidney, respectively. To identify signaling pathways associated with miRNAs regulated by AFB1 in the liver and OTA in the kidney, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using ShinyGO v0.76 (http: http://bioinformatics. sdstate. edu) (Ge, et al., 2020). A false discovery rate of 0.05 and an edge cut-off value of 0.3 were applied. In the resulting network visualization, node size denotes the number of genes associated with a specific function, whereas the color intensity represents the relevance of the relationship. Of the human miRNAs regulated by AFB1, hsa-miRNA-34a, hsa-miRNA-33a, hsa-miRNA-122, and hsa-miRNA-224 were selected on to determine the potential mechanism of aflatoxin in the liver. Using Shiny GO 0.76 (http://bioinformatics. sdstate. ed) (Ge, Jung and Yao, 2020), GO enrichment analyses of the targets of the aforementioned four miRNAs were used to identify the effect of miRNAs on cell differentiation, neurogenesis, generation of neurons, locomotion, cell development, and other processes (Figure 2). Aflatoxin affects the nervous system. Administration of AFB1 to rats causes neurotoxicity by degenerating the central and peripheral nervous systems (Ikegwuonu, 1983), as well as sciatic nerve degeneration in the myelin sheath (Makhlouf, 2020). AFB1 also alters locomotion and neurotoxic markers in zebrafish embryos and larvae (Wu, et al., 2019).Figure 2Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224 altered by aflatoxin B1 in the liver. GO enrichment analyses of targets of four miRNAs (miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224) were conducted using Shiny GO 0.76 (http:bioinformatics.sdstate.edu). Each node is an enriched GO term. Lines connect related GO terms. The percentage of overlapping genes is represented by the thickness of the line. The number of genes is represented by the size of the green circle.Figure 2 Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224 altered by aflatoxin B1 in the liver. GO enrichment analyses of targets of four miRNAs (miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224) were conducted using Shiny GO 0.76 (http:bioinformatics.sdstate.edu). Each node is an enriched GO term. Lines connect related GO terms. The percentage of overlapping genes is represented by the thickness of the line. The number of genes is represented by the size of the green circle. To determine the effect of OTA in the kidney, GO enrichment analyses of the targets of three miRNAs (miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, miRNA-200c) regulated in response to OTA were performed using Shiny GO 0.76 (http:bioinformatics.sdstate.edu). The analyses suggest that OTA regulates processes including neurogenesis, generation of neurons, neuron development, cell development, axon development, and regulation of cell differentiation (Figure 3). OTA induces neurotoxicity in human astrocytes by inhibiting proliferation (Park, et al., 2019). Furthermore, OTA induces apoptosis in neuronal cells, such as the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, and HT-22 cells (mouse hippocampal cell line) via oxidative stress (Yoon, et al., 2009). Therefore, AFB1 and OTA are associated with neurogenesis. Future studies should explore the relationship between mycotoxins and neurotoxicity.Figure 3Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, and miRNA-200c altered by ochratoxin A in the kidney.

Hub genes of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA have been identified using Cytoscape 3.7.2 and its plug-in CytoHubba (Chin, et al., 2014). This illustration depicts the importance of hubs using a color scale ranging from red (most important) to yellow (least significant) (p-value cut-off of 0.05). Ten hub genes from the targets of four miRNAs (hsa-miRNA-34a, hsa-miRNA-122, hsa-miRNA-33a, and hsa-miRNA-224) regulated by AFB1 were identified based on their degree of closeness (Figure 4A). The top 10 hub genes were notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), SRC proto-oncogene (SRC), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), disc large MAGUK scaffold protein 4 (DLG4), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG), SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3), and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1). AFB1 induces immunotoxicity via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (Zhou, et al., 2019). AFB1 regulates lung cancer cell migration by inducing Src phosphorylation (Cui, et al., 2015). AFB1 toxicity dysregulates PPARG and BCL expression in the liver of chickens (Liu, et al., 2020).Figure 4Predicted targets of microRNAs regulated by aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A.

(B) Ten hub genes targeted by three miRNAs (miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, and miRNA-200c) altered by ochratoxin A (OTA), as determined by the degree of closeness using Cytoscape and its plug-in cytoHubba. The degree of connectivity is represented by the color of the node; red represents a higher degree and yellow represents a lower degree of connectivity. Ten hub genes from the targets of three miRNAs (miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, miRNA-200c) regulated by OTA were identified according to the degree of closeness using Cytoscape and its plug-in CytoHubba (Figure 4B). The top 10 hub genes were mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), KRAS proto-oncogene (KRAS), jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (JUN), EGFR, MAPK1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), NOTCH1, E1A binding protein P300 (EP300), and VEGFA (Figure 4B). OTA treatment in HEK 293 cells enhances the expression of VEGF, a vascular permeability factor (Raghubeer, et al., 2019). Exposure of primary murine keratinocytes to non-cytotoxic doses of OTA regulates cell proliferation by activating EGFR, ERK1/2, p-AKT, and c-Jun (Kumar, et al., 2013). Therefore, VEGF and EGFR are shared targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA. VEGF and EGFR inhibitors have emerged as critical therapies in several tumors and other diseases (Tabernero, 2007; Wang, et al., 2017). We speculate that VEGF and EGFR inhibitors could be beneficial medications for toxin impact. In this study, the key differences in predicted targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA lie in the specific pathways and functions they regulate. The targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 includes genes involved in neurotrophic signaling (BDNF) (Yang, et al., 2023), cell adhesion (DLG4), metabolic regulation (PPARG) (Ahmadian, et al., 2013), and hormone signaling (ESR1) (Gui, et al., 2025). The target of miRNAs by OTA focuses on the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (MAPK3, KRAS, JUN, MAPK1) (Guo, et al., 2020), cell shape and migration (CDC42) (Álvarez-Aznar, et al., 2025), and chromatin remodeling (EP300) (Fasano, et al., 2023). NOTCH1, VEGFA, and EGFR are common miRNA targets that regulate both AFB1 and OTA. These proteins are important in transcription regulation, receptor activation, and oncogenic activity (Koveitypour, et al., 2019; Troy, et al., 2013).\n\n## microRNA biogenesis\nTypically, nascent primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts are converted into microRNAs (miRNAs) through two sequential cleavage events. miRNAs are produced by the miRNA biogenesis pathway, which involves multiple steps and numerous proteins and enzymes. The DGCR8 subunit of the Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessor complex first interacts with Drosha to process pri-miRNAs. Drosha then releases a hairpin-shaped precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), approximately 65 nucleotides long (Denli, et al., 2004; Pong and Gullerova, 2018). Exportin 5 transports the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm, where the RNase Dicer cleaves it to form a mature miRNA (approximately 22 nucleotides). The resulting small RNA duplex is loaded onto an Argonaute protein, where one strand is preferentially retained while the other is degraded. To target mRNAs for translational degradation or inhibition, one strand of mature miRNA is loaded onto complexes containing Argonaute (Macrae, et al., 2006). miRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and responding to environmental stresses such as oxidative stress and DNA damage. They are implicated in many biological processes, including human diseases (Bottai, et al., 2014; Wang, et al., 2010) and drug resistance (Gomes, et al., 2016). In addition, miRNA expression profiles show that miRNAs are expressed in utero in response to various environmental factors, including xenochemicals (e.g., ethanol, bisphenol A, and gold nanoparticles), endogenous factors (e.g., hypoxia or oxidative stress), and certain nutritional states (e.g., high-fat diets) (Kappil and Chen, 2014). miRNAs have been used as diagnostic biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer. Because miRNAs are distinct biomarkers and detectable in the serum, saliva, and urine, they serve as valuable biological indicators for disease detection and prevention. miRNAs regulate gene transcription in eukaryotes and influence gene expression in mammals (Catalanotto, et al., 2016). Therefore, identifying miRNAs that inhibit the transcription and translation of disease-promoting genes is a promising strategy for disease prevention and control. While protein assays are commonly used for the early detection of mycotoxin pathogenicity, miRNA detection is often disregarded. miRNAs are found in tissues and body fluids, making diagnosis possible by identifying differentially expressed miRNAs. Moreover, their high sensitivity and specificity enable the detection of early-stage disorders and prediction of disease progression and drug resistance (Chen et al., 2022). miRNA interference has potential as a method to prevent mycotoxin toxicity. Mycotoxins are among the most prevalent food contaminants, and miRNAs have recently been reported to play a role in the body’s response to mycotoxins (Chen, Yang, Li, Wu, Nepovimova, Long, Wu and Kuca, 2022; Rong, et al., 2019). Therefore, understanding miRNAs may promote the identification of novel biomarkers for determining toxin exposure and disease risk. In this review, we summarize the effects of mycotoxins on miRNA expression in various organs and discuss the potential biological roles and targets of miRNAs regulated by two common toxins, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA). This review highlights miRNA targets associated with mycotoxin exposure, offering insights into mycotoxin-associated pathways and the identification of biomarkers for the detection, prevention, and management of mycotoxin-related diseases. AFB1 and OTA are emphasized because of their high toxicity, widespread occurrence in food and feed sources, and detrimental effects on both health and the economy.\n\n## Mycotoxins in organ systems\nMycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites generated by fungi that contaminate food and pose a global threat to human health and welfare (Milićević, et al., 2016). Several fungi, such as Aspergillus, Claviceps, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Alternaria, produce different mycotoxins (Steyn, 1995). Mycotoxins are found in animal feed and products as well as in food (Balázs and Schepers, 2007) and can affect multiple organs, particularly the digestive tract, including the colon (Gajęcka, et al., 2018), liver (Wang, et al., 2019c), esophagus (Yekeler, et al., 2001), stomach (Craddock, et al., 1987), and kidneys (Rumora, et al., 2007). Short-term exposure to high doses of mycotoxins causes acute toxicity that manifests as rapid-onset diarrhea, borborygmus, and abdominal pain (Liew and Mohd-Redzwan, 2018). Prolonged exposure to a low dose of mycotoxins can damage the immune and nervous systems, and adversely affect organs such as the kidneys, liver and colon (Gajęcka, Waśkiewicz, Zielonka, Goliński, Rykaczewska, Lisieska-Żołnierczyk and Gajęcki, 2018; Wang, Zhai, Xia, Wang, Ruan, Zhou, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Ren and Yang, 2019c). Mycotoxin exposure has also been associated with various illnesses and cancers, including esophageal carcinoma, obesity, and diabetes (Chen and Wu, 2017; Xue, et al., 2019). Several mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, OTA, and fumonisins, induce cellular stress and damage (Gómez-Osorio, et al., 2024), which can alter the expression profiles of miRNAs across various organs (Kappari, et al., 2024). Different mycotoxins target different organs, leading to distinct patterns of miRNA dysregulation. In the liver, AFB1-induced changes in miRNA expression can affect pathways related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, and detoxification (Yang, et al., 2014). In the kidneys, OTA induces nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity by altering miRNA expression (Marin, et al., 2019). Mycotoxins influence miRNA expression through multiple mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of cellular processes and contributing to the etiology of liver and intestinal diseases. The specific miRNAs and molecular pathways affected vary depending on the type of mycotoxin and the target organ (Kappari, Dasireddy, Applegate, Selvaraj and Shanmugasundaram, 2024).\n\n## Mycotoxin-Mediated Effects on miRNA Expression in organs\nThe liver is a major target organ for mycotoxins, where they undergo biotransformation and may cause significant damage (Wang, et al., 2023). Mycotoxins such as OTA and AFB1 are particularly well-studied for their effects on hepatic miRNA expression (Jorud, et al., 2024; Luo, et al., 2025). AFB1 is a potent human carcinogen with well-documented hepatotoxic effects (Long, et al., 2016; Shen and Ong, 1996). Exposure to AFB1 can induce cytotoxicity through the generation of reactive oxygen species and genetic alterations, especially in the p53 gene (Peroxisomes, 1995). AFB1 exposure has been shown to alter hepatic miRNA expression, leading to hepatotoxicity and increased risk of liver cancer (Yang, Lian, Feng, Srinivas, Guo, Zhong, Zhuang and Wang, 2014). For example, miRNA-24, modulated by AFB1, has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Liu, et al., 2014b). Additionally, AFB1 exposure upregulates miRNA-122 and miRNA-429, both of which are associated with liver damage and are considered potential biomarkers of liver injury (Livingstone, et al., 2017). In the kidneys, OTA induces nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity through oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, and autophagy (Khoi, et al., 2021). OTA also alters miRNA expression profiles associated with renal function, leading to nephrotoxicity (Dai, et al., 2014) (Hennemeier, et al., 2014). OTA can decrease the level of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 via miR-132 and miR-200c, resulting in OTA toxicity (Stachurska, et al., 2013). Moreover, OTA-induced upregulation of miRNA-29b enhances collagen expression in human kidney cells (Hennemeier, Humpf, Gekle and Schwerdt, 2014). In the kidneys of OTA-intoxicated animal models, five miRNAs: miRNA-497, miRNA-133a-3p, miRNA-423-3p, miRNA-34a, and miRNA-542-3p, were upregulated. In contrast, three miRNAs (miRNA-421-3p, miRNA-490, and miRNA-9840-3p) were downregulated (Marin, Braicu, Dumitrescu, Pistol, Cojocneanu, Neagoe and Taranu, 2019). Mycotoxins can also affect the lungs, primarily through oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially leading to respiratory disorders (Huang, et al., 2024; Schütze, et al., 2010). Upregulation of miRNA-155 and a decreased BAX/BCL-2 ratio suggest either a tissue-specific response to OTA exposure or inhibition of TP53-dependent apoptosis in lung fibroblasts (Kharboush, et al., 2024). Additionally, miRNA-138-1 is implicated in AFB1-induced malignant transformation of B-2A13 cells by targeting phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (Wang, et al., 2016). In the intestine, mycotoxins, particularly deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisins, are commonly found due to direct exposure from contaminated feed (Pierron, et al., 2016). These toxins can disrupt the intestinal barrier, resulting in inflammation and altered immune responses through changes in miRNA expression (Behrouzi, et al., 2020; Gao, et al., 2020; Gao, et al., 2023).\n\n## miRNA response to mycotoxins in the gut\nThe gut microbiota affects the digestive and immune systems and defends the host against mycotoxicity (Bouhet and Oswald, 2005). Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are exposed to significant doses of food‐associated contaminants, including mycotoxins, depending on their location (Bouhet and Oswald, 2005). IECs respond through the innate local immune response to reduce the threat of infection. Mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins, trichothecenes, ochratoxins, and zearalenone) affect overall host health through gut microbiota modulation (Liew and Mohd-Redzwan, 2018). miRNAs produced by host IECs modulate the microbiota (Liu, et al., 2016).\n\n## Destruxin\nMetarhizium anisopliae, an entomopathogenic fungus, secretes destruxins as secondary metabolites (Wang, et al., 2004). Destruxins exhibit insecticidal activity against a variety of pests, with modes of action including contact toxicity, gut toxicity, antifeedant effects, ovicidal effects, and oviposition-deterrence (Sowjanya Sree, et al., 2008). Destruxins may function both as V-H+-ATPase inhibitors and calcium ionophores (Vázquez, et al., 2005). Additionally, destruxins possess cytotoxic, antiviral, anticancer, and herbicidal properties (Liu and Tzeng, 2012). Wu et al. (2018) showed that combined treatment with destruxin and the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil synergistically suppressed the viability of colon cancer cells and reduced tumorigenesis in 5-fluorouracil-resistant colon cells by increasing miRNA-214 and downregulating β-catenin and the mammalian target of rapamycin (Wu, et al., 2018).\n\n## Alternariol\nFood and feed supplies are frequently contaminated with alternariol (AOH) produced by Alternaria species. AOH is an emerging mycotoxin with documented negative effects and toxicological risk assessment (Gruber-Dorninger, et al., 2017). AOH has the potential for endocrine disruption, genotoxicity, pro-oxidation activity, and immunomodulation (Kollarova, et al., 2018; Kowalska, et al., 2021; Lehmann, et al., 2006; Tiessen, et al., 2013). Moreover, AOH may affect cell membrane characteristics critical to the innate immune response (Del Favero, et al., 2020). Schmutz et al. (2019) showed that AOH regulates interleukin‐1β‐induced inflammatory responses in differentiated Caco‐2 cells, with induction of miRNA‐16 and miRNA‐125b at 40 µM, suggesting that AOH impacts the immune response at the intestinal barrier (Schmutz, et al., 2019).\n\n## AFB1 and aflatoxin M1\nAflatoxins are secondary metabolites generated by fungi such as Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. These toxins are common contaminants of a wide range of crops, including tree nuts and cereals (Kumar, et al., 2021). The most common and dangerous of these toxins is AFB1 (Kumar, et al., 2016). Aflatoxin M1, the primary hydroxylated metabolite of AFB1, is also a major concern because it is found in the milk (hence, designation M) of mammals that consume contaminated feedstuff (Marchese, et al., 2018). AFB1 and aflatoxin M1 reduce cell viability in the NCM460 colon epithelial cell line via miRNA-628-3p- and miRNA-217-5p-mediated regulation of cell surface death receptors, as well as miRNA-11y-mediated regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Gao, et al., 2022).\n\n## Zearalenone and DON\nZearalenone (ZEN) and DON are generated by Fusarium species in food products and feeds. In mice, ZEN causes toxicity in the intestine by suppressing immunity (Liu, et al., 2014a). DON, which is found in grains, is one of the most abundant trichothecenes (Mishra, et al., 2020). DON has been reported to have harmful effects on humans and other animals. Pigs exposed to DON exhibit reduced feed consumption as the initial negative consequence; they also show poor immune function, reproductive health, and growth performance (Pierron, Alassane-Kpembi and Oswald, 2016; Reddy, et al., 2018b). Pigs consuming a DON-contaminated diet experience epithelial lesions in the intestine and stomach, along with intestinal inflammation (Pierron, Alassane-Kpembi and Oswald, 2016; Reddy, et al., 2018a). DON has been associated with gut microbiota disruption through the induction of immunotoxicity (Liao, et al., 2018). On exposure to ZEN, porcine IECs showed altered expression profiles of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs (Wang, et al., 2019a).\n\n## miRNA regulation in response to mycotoxins in the liver\nMycotoxins are metabolized primarily in the liver (Matsuda, et al., 2013; Zöllner, et al., 2002). The liver contributes to detoxification and protection against foreign substances and toxic chemicals (Grant, 1991). When xenobiotics penetrate the body, it produces numerous enzymes that convert them into hydrophilic and polar compounds (Iyanagi, 2007). miRNAs are involved in various liver diseases, such as fibrosis, liver injury, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and HCC (Schueller, et al., 2018). In the liver, miRNA-122 regulates several genes related to hepatic cholesterol and lipid metabolism and is essential for maintaining homeostasis (Wen and Friedman, 2012). Inhibition of miRNA-122 using antisense approaches reduced plasma cholesterol levels in mice (Ma, et al., 2012). Several miRNAs have been found to play a role in liver fibrosis. Serum levels of miRNA-571 and miRNA-122 have been proposed to be potential biomarkers of liver fibrosis (Roderburg, et al., 2012; Waidmann, et al., 2012). Figure 1 summarizes the regulation of miRNAs by mycotoxins in the liver.Figure 1The effect of mycotoxins on miRNA regulation in the liver. The regulation of miRNA by mycotoxin in the liver. Schematic illustration showing the upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue) of miRNAs in liver cells after mycotoxin treatment.Figure 1 The effect of mycotoxins on miRNA regulation in the liver. The regulation of miRNA by mycotoxin in the liver. Schematic illustration showing the upregulation (red) or downregulation (blue) of miRNAs in liver cells after mycotoxin treatment.\n\n## Aflatoxin\nAflatoxins, produced by A. flavus, are potent liver toxins, and their presence in food is a major risk factor for HCC (Lin, et al., 2005). In developing countries, HCC accounts for more than 600,000 deaths (Parkin, 2006). Among aflatoxins, AFB1 is the most toxic aflatoxin and has been shown to induce tumors in the liver and other organs such as the colon and kidneys (Maxwell, 1998). In the nucleus, Drosha, an RNase III enzyme, and its cofactor DGCR8 convert pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs, which are then transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (Han, et al., 2004). Mycotoxins can disrupt these processes, potentially influencing the levels of mature miRNA (Gregory, et al., 2006). Reportedly, miRNA biogenesis-related genes, such as Drosha, Dicer, and DGCR8, are disrupted by AFB1 treatment in HepG2 cells (Yang, Lian, Feng, Srinivas, Guo, Zhong, Zhuang and Wang, 2014). Deep sequencing of rat liver tissue showed AFB1-induced hepatic injury and differentially expressed miRNAs; rno-miRNA-34a-5p was upregulated to assist in p53-mediated repair of DNA damage in the F344 rat liver after AFB1 exposure (Liu, et al., 2015). Several studies have shown differentially expressed miRNAs in AFB1-treated human liver cell lines (Marrone, et al., 2016; Zhu, et al., 2015). Marrone et al. (2016) demonstrated that miRNA-122 is inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to AFB1 treatment in HepaRG cells. AFB1-induced down-regulation of miR-122 was linked to suppression of the liver-enriched transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha and miR-122 regulation pathway. miRNA-33a levels were upregulated in HCC cells treated with AFB1 and treatment at IC50 decreased β-catenin expression, which affected the β-catenin pathway and inhibited cell growth (Fang, et al., 2013). Mycotoxins can influence this process by affecting the activity of transcription factors. For example, AFB1 can alter the expression of genes encoding transcription factors such as p53 that regulate miRNA transcription (Fang, Feng, Wu, Srinivas, Yang, Fan, Yang and Wang, 2013). Zhu et al. (2015) conducted miRNA profiling in HepG2 cells treated with AFB1 and found that miRNA-34a was upregulated. This upregulation occurred through multiple pathways, including activation of the p53 pathway, which directly regulates miR-34a transcription. Additionally, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was downregulated, indicating that AFB1 may upregulate miRNA-34a by modulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.\n\n## Alternariol and altertoxin II\nAlternaria mycotoxins, such as alternariol (AOH) or altertoxin II (ATX II), are produced by Alternaria spp. These mycotoxins are common food and feed pollutants known for their immunomodulatory properties (Groestlinger, et al., 2022; Schmutz, Cenk and Marko, 2019). Combined treatment of AOH and ATX II induced cytotoxicity in the HCC cell line HepG2 (Vejdovszky, et al., 2017). A microarray study of the expression profiles of miRNAs in HepG2 cells showed that miRNA-4654, miRNA-6720-3p, and miRNA-4715-3p were upregulated by AOH, while miRNA-5583-5p was downregulated following ATX II treatment (Vejdovszky, Sack, Jarolim, Aichinger, Somoza and Marko, 2017). In addition, digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that miRNA-29a was significantly upregulated by AOH alone or in combination with ATX II after 24 h (Vejdovszky, Sack, Jarolim, Aichinger, Somoza and Marko, 2017).\n\n## Myrothecine A\nIsolated from endophytic fungi abundant in the traditional Chinese medicine herb Artemisia annua, myrothecine A was produced by extracts of Myrothecium roridum strain IFB-E012 (Shen, et al., 2015). Myrothecine A exerts anti-proliferative effects in the human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 via the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (Song, et al., 2019). In addition, Fu et al. showed that myrothecine A inhibited cell growth by modulating miRNA-221 in SMMC-7721 cells, indicating its potential use as an antitumor drug for HCC. While myrothecin A could override the inhibitory effect of miR-221 on dendritic cell development, miR-221 controlled dendritic cell maturation in the microenvironment of hepatoma cells (Fu, et al., 2019).\n\n## Ochratoxin A\nOTA, the most prevalent mycotoxin among ochratoxins A, B, and C, is a secondary metabolite generated by Aspergillus and Penicillium (van der Merwe, et al., 1965). OTA causes liver inflammation in humans and other animals (Wang, Zhai, Xia, Wang, Ruan, Zhou, Zhu, Zhang, Zhang, Ye, Ren and Yang, 2019c). Lower doses of OTA do not cause noticeable pathological alterations, however, several early hepatotoxicity investigations using relatively high concentrations of OTA have revealed its ability to cause liver lesions (Aydin, et al., 2003; Ferrante, et al., 2006; Qi, et al., 2014; Rached, et al., 2007). Several studies have shown that OTA regulates liver miRNAs, both in vitro and in vivo (Qi, Yang, Chen, He, Dweep, Guo, Cheng, Xu, Luo, Gretz, Dai and Huang, 2014; Zhao, et al., 2017). HepG2 cells exposed to OTA showed upregulated miRNA-122, the most abundant miRNA in the mammalian liver, and HepG2 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Zhu, et al., 2016).\n\n## Fumonisin B1\nFumonisin is found in animal feed, human food products, and cereal grains (Knutsen, et al., 2018). Among fumonisins, fumonisin B1 (FB1), FB2, and FB3 are the most abundant and can regulate sphingolipid biosynthesis (Martinova and Merrill 1995; Reisinger, et al., 2016). FB1 is the most toxic fumonisin and has been implicated in HCC and liver tumors in rodents (Gelderblom, et al., 2008). FB1 affects the expression of cell cycle-related genes, including cyclin E and p21 (Wang et al., 2013). FB1 treatment of HepG2 cells significantly inhibited miRNA-27b expression and upregulated human cytochrome P450, a metabolic activator of many procarcinogens (Chuturgoon, et al., 2014).\n\n## miRNA regulation in response to mycotoxins in the kidneys\nmiRNAs play an essential role in kidney development and function (Zhao, et al., 2020). The levels of Dicer, an endonuclease involved in miRNA processing, increased during OTA toxicity (Marin, Braicu, Dumitrescu, Pistol, Cojocneanu, Neagoe and Taranu, 2019). In patients with diabetes and obstructive nephropathy, Dicer deficiency in the proximal tubules increased inflammation, tubular cell death, and interstitial fibrosis, indicating the crucial role of Dicer and its link to miRNAs in the regulation of extracellular matrix accumulation and renal tubular injury (Ma, et al., 2018). Podocyte-specific deletion of Drosha, the core protein involved in miRNA processing, caused severe glomerulopathy (Zhdanova, et al., 2011). Several miRNAs, including miRNA-204, miRNA-215, miRNA-216, miRNA-192, and miRNA-194, are abundantly expressed in human kidneys (Sun, et al., 2004). miRNA-21 enhances kidney fibrosis by modulating metabolic pathways (Chau, et al., 2012). Therefore, miRNAs are important in kidney function.\n\n## Ochratoxin A\nOTA is the most prevalent mycotoxin and one of the most potent nephrotoxins and renal carcinogens in mammals (Pfohl-Leszkowicz and Manderville, 2007). Numerous studies have shown that OTA-induced nephrotoxicity is mediated by miRNAs. For example, treatment of HEK 293 cells with OTA resulted in toxicity and inhibited the expression of miRNA biogenesis genes, such as Dicer1, DGCR8, and Drosha (Zhao, Qi, Dai, He, Dweep, Guo, Luo, Gretz, Luo, Huang, and Xu, 2017). The levels of Dicer1 and Drosha, but not DGR8, are significantly downregulated in the kidneys after OTA administration, indicating impaired miRNA biogenesis (Dai, Zhao, Qi, Xu, He, Guo, Dweep, Cheng, Luo, Xia, Gretz and Huang, 2014). Similarly,Stachurska et al. showed that OTA treatment of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells regulated miRNA processing by enhancing Lin28 protein, DGCR-8, miRNA-132 and miRNA-200c expression (Stachurska, Ciesla, Kozakowska, Wolffram, Boesch-Saadatmandi, Rimbach, Jozkowicz, Dulak and Loboda, 2013). Furthermore, anti-miRNA-132 and anti-miRNA-200c blocked the OTA-mediated reduction in heme oxygenase-1 and the increase in reactive oxygen species production and TGF-β expression. OTA reportedly promotes collagen formation by downregulating miRNA-29b through reducing miRNA-29b levels in the cytoplasm (Hennemeier, Humpf, Gekle and Schwerdt, 2014). Dai et al. conducted miRNA profiling of OTA toxicity in rat kidneys and found miRNA-129, miRNA-130a, miRNA-218b, miRNA-130b, miRNA-141, and miRNA-3588 to be suppressed in medium-dose OTA-treated rat kidneys but upregulated by high-dose OTA treatments (Dai, Zhao, Qi, Xu, He, Guo, Dweep, Cheng, Luo, Xia, Gretz and Huang, 2014). Marin et al., (2019) conducted miRNA profiling of kidneys from piglets fed different doses of OTA-contaminated feed and found elevated levels of miRNA-497, miRNA-133a-3p, miRNA-423-3p, miRNA-34a, miRNA-542-3p, miRNA-490, and miRNA-9840-3p in the kidneys of OTA-treated piglets compared to those of the controls.\n\n## Citrinin\nCitrinin (CTN), produced by the genera Penicillium, Monascus, and Aspergillus, occurs in vegetable-based foods (de Oliveira Filho, et al., 2017). It is a fungal secondary metabolite and a polyketide nephrotoxic mycotoxin that is found in food and feed worldwide and is most common in stored grains (Čulig, et al., 2017). Modest doses of OTA and CTN, alone or in combination, caused lipid peroxidation and time-dependent apoptosis in rabbit kidneys (Kumar, et al., 2014). Numerous studies have shown that CTN exposure causes toxicity by affecting the immune system (Islam, et al., 2012; Sharma, 1993), liver, and kidneys (Phillips and Hayes, 1978). Combined treatment with OTA and CTN induced oxidative damage in the liver and kidneys (Rašić, et al., 2019). Combined treatment with OTA and CTN induced cytotoxicity in HEK 293 cells due to the accumulation of cells in the S and G2/M phases. A luciferase assay using the pmiR-RB-REPORT™ vector harboring the 3′ UTR of PDCD10 and CyclinG1 was used to examine miRNA-1-3p, hsa-miRNA-122-5p, and their target genes associated with apoptotic signaling and cell cycle proteins, namely programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10) and cyclin G1 (CCNG1) (Gong, et al., 2019). Additionally, western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR confirmed their expression patterns, indicating that miRNA-target interactions may be responsible for mycotoxin-induced cell death (Gong, Zhu, Li, Ming, Duan, Wang and Jiang, 2019).\n\n## Patulin (PAT)\nPatulin is a secondary metabolite produced by more than 60 different fungi, including Penicillium and Aspergillus (Wright, 2015). It is commonly found in moldy vegetables and fruits such as apples (Mahato, et al., 2021). Several studies have reported that patulin causes significant renal toxicity (Lu, et al., 2017; Speijers, et al., 1988). Recently, patulin was shown to decrease miRNA-144 expression by activating the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 pathway in HEK 293 cells (Pillay, et al., 2021). In patulin-exposed HEK 293 cells, miRNA-27b inhibited with cytotoxicity (Pillay, et al., 2022).\n\n## miRNA regulation in response to mycotoxins in testes\nMycotoxicity in rat testes occurs following exposure to the nonsteroidal estrogenic mycotoxin ZEA (Cheraghi, et al., 2015). Histopathology of ZEA-treated mice shows that injured germ cells, particularly spermatogonia and spermatocytes, gradually undergo apoptosis after treatment. OTA treatment induces cytotoxicity and enhanced Dicer and miRNA-122 expression in GC-2 cells, a spermatocyte-like cell line, while a miRNA-122 inhibitor suppressed apoptosis (Chen, et al., 2015). Zheng et al. demonstrated that ZEN stimulated the proliferation of mouse TM3 cells (Leydig cells), and miRNA deep sequencing analysis showed that miRNAs from ZEN-treated TM3 cells were differentially expressed and that the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway was targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs (Zheng, et al., 2019). Wang et al. also showed that the exposure of TM3 cells to ZEN significantly increased miRNA-467e-3p, miRNA-19a-3p miRNA-96-5p, and miRNA-221-5p expression, whereas decreased miRNA-146b-3p, miRNA-301a-5p, miRNA-210-5p, miRNA-3098-5p, miRNA-185-5p, miRNA-467e-3p, miRNA-441-5p, miRNA-410-3p, miRNA-195a-3p, miRNA-326-3p, miRNA-615-3p, and miRNA-96-3p expression (Wang, et al., 2019b). The target genes of miRNAs altered after ZEN exposure are involved in the PI3K-AKT, Ras, Ras-associated protein 1 (Rap1), and forkhead box (FoxO) signaling pathways (Wang, Wu, Li, He, Huang, Chen, Chen, Long, Yang and Li, 2019b). Xu et al. reported that ZEN decreases TM3 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and increases miRNA-96-5p levels. ZEN-induced loss of viability in TM3 cells can be recovered by blocking miRNA-96-5p, suggesting that miRNA-96-5p may be a useful biomarker of male infertility (Xu, et al., 2021).\n\n## miRNA regulation in response to mycotoxins in the placenta and uterus\nThe functions of miRNAs in placental development have been documented (Awamleh, et al., 2019; Fu, et al., 2013). The placentas of patients with preeclampsia show lower levels of DICER, and DICER knockdown in trophoblasts inhibits the processing of miRNAs (Tang, et al., 2020). Cytotrophoblast proliferation is regulated by Dicer-dependent miRNAs (Forbes, et al., 2012). DROSHA expression increased significantly in the ovariectomized mouse uterus after progesterone therapy and caused stromal decidualization in a stromal cell culture model (Zhang, et al., 2016). ZEN and its metabolites can bind to estrogen receptors and are considered mycoestrogens (Ali and Degen, 2018). Placental miRNAs are differentially expressed when exposed to xenobiotics such as environmental pollutants (Li, et al., 2015). Andersen et al. showed that miRNAs such as mmu-miRNA-133b-5p and mmu-miRNA-7028-5p were differentially expressed in the placentas of mice treated with ZEN (Andersen, et al., 2020).\n\n## miRNA regulation in response to mycotoxins in lungs\nSeveral studies have shown that mycotoxins cause pulmonary epithelial cell damage with lung inflammation. Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1) may be associated with lung carcinogenesis; it increases oxidative DNA damage in alveolar epithelial cells and generates inflammation through increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression (Shao, et al., 2019). OTA has also been reported to induce heart and lung damage in rats (Okutan, et al., 2004). Based on miRNA microarray analyses, Wang et al. demonstrated that miRNA expression was altered at passage 50 (P50) in B-2A13 cells (immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells stably expressing CYP2A13) treated with AFB1. MiRNA-138-1-3p contributes to AFB-induced malignant transformation of B-2A13 cells by inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, and migration of P50 B-2A13 cells (Wang, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Ji, Xu, Wang, Sun, Gao and Wang, 2016).\n\n## miRNA regulation in response to mycotoxins in hearts\nCTN administration alters cardiac morphology and causes pericardial edema and heart malformation in zebrafish (Wu, et al., 2013). CTN treatment in zebrafish downregulated miRNA-138 and increased the expression of cardiac-related genes aldh1a2 and cspg2, the targets of miRNA-138. CTN-induced cardiac abnormalities were reversed by overexpression of miRNA-138, implying that CTN exposure harms heart development by altering heart morphogenesis through miRNA-138 dysregulation (Wu, Yang, Yu and Liu, 2013).\n\n## Predicted biological roles of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA\nAFB1 and OTA are the most potent mycotoxins affecting the liver and kidney, respectively. To identify signaling pathways associated with miRNAs regulated by AFB1 in the liver and OTA in the kidney, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was conducted using ShinyGO v0.76 (http: http://bioinformatics. sdstate. edu) (Ge, et al., 2020). A false discovery rate of 0.05 and an edge cut-off value of 0.3 were applied. In the resulting network visualization, node size denotes the number of genes associated with a specific function, whereas the color intensity represents the relevance of the relationship. Of the human miRNAs regulated by AFB1, hsa-miRNA-34a, hsa-miRNA-33a, hsa-miRNA-122, and hsa-miRNA-224 were selected on to determine the potential mechanism of aflatoxin in the liver. Using Shiny GO 0.76 (http://bioinformatics. sdstate. ed) (Ge, Jung and Yao, 2020), GO enrichment analyses of the targets of the aforementioned four miRNAs were used to identify the effect of miRNAs on cell differentiation, neurogenesis, generation of neurons, locomotion, cell development, and other processes (Figure 2). Aflatoxin affects the nervous system. Administration of AFB1 to rats causes neurotoxicity by degenerating the central and peripheral nervous systems (Ikegwuonu, 1983), as well as sciatic nerve degeneration in the myelin sheath (Makhlouf, 2020). AFB1 also alters locomotion and neurotoxic markers in zebrafish embryos and larvae (Wu, et al., 2019).Figure 2Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224 altered by aflatoxin B1 in the liver. GO enrichment analyses of targets of four miRNAs (miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224) were conducted using Shiny GO 0.76 (http:bioinformatics.sdstate.edu). Each node is an enriched GO term. Lines connect related GO terms. The percentage of overlapping genes is represented by the thickness of the line. The number of genes is represented by the size of the green circle.Figure 2 Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-33a, miRNA-34a, miRNA-122, and miRNA-224 altered by aflatoxin B1 in the liver.

Each node is an enriched GO term. Lines connect related GO terms. The percentage of overlapping genes is represented by the thickness of the line. The number of genes is represented by the size of the green circle. To determine the effect of OTA in the kidney, GO enrichment analyses of the targets of three miRNAs (miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, miRNA-200c) regulated in response to OTA were performed using Shiny GO 0.76 (http:bioinformatics.sdstate.edu). The analyses suggest that OTA regulates processes including neurogenesis, generation of neurons, neuron development, cell development, axon development, and regulation of cell differentiation (Figure 3). OTA induces neurotoxicity in human astrocytes by inhibiting proliferation (Park, et al., 2019). Furthermore, OTA induces apoptosis in neuronal cells, such as the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, and HT-22 cells (mouse hippocampal cell line) via oxidative stress (Yoon, et al., 2009). Therefore, AFB1 and OTA are associated with neurogenesis. Future studies should explore the relationship between mycotoxins and neurotoxicity.Figure 3Gene ontology (GO) network of predicted targets of miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, and miRNA-200c altered by ochratoxin A in the kidney.

The number of genes is represented by the size of the green circle.\n\n## Predicted targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA\nHub genes of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA have been identified using Cytoscape 3.7.2 and its plug-in CytoHubba (Chin, et al., 2014). This illustration depicts the importance of hubs using a color scale ranging from red (most important) to yellow (least significant) (p-value cut-off of 0.05). Ten hub genes from the targets of four miRNAs (hsa-miRNA-34a, hsa-miRNA-122, hsa-miRNA-33a, and hsa-miRNA-224) regulated by AFB1 were identified based on their degree of closeness (Figure 4A). The top 10 hub genes were notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), SRC proto-oncogene (SRC), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), disc large MAGUK scaffold protein 4 (DLG4), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG), SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3), and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1). AFB1 induces immunotoxicity via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway (Zhou, et al., 2019). AFB1 regulates lung cancer cell migration by inducing Src phosphorylation (Cui, et al., 2015). AFB1 toxicity dysregulates PPARG and BCL expression in the liver of chickens (Liu, et al., 2020).Figure 4Predicted targets of microRNAs regulated by aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A.

(B) Ten hub genes targeted by three miRNAs (miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, and miRNA-200c) altered by ochratoxin A (OTA), as determined by the degree of closeness using Cytoscape and its plug-in cytoHubba.

Ten hub genes from the targets of three miRNAs (miRNA-29b, miRNA-132, miRNA-200c) regulated by OTA were identified according to the degree of closeness using Cytoscape and its plug-in CytoHubba (Figure 4B). The top 10 hub genes were mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAPK3), KRAS proto-oncogene (KRAS), jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (JUN), EGFR, MAPK1, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), NOTCH1, E1A binding protein P300 (EP300), and VEGFA (Figure 4B). OTA treatment in HEK 293 cells enhances the expression of VEGF, a vascular permeability factor (Raghubeer, et al., 2019). Exposure of primary murine keratinocytes to non-cytotoxic doses of OTA regulates cell proliferation by activating EGFR, ERK1/2, p-AKT, and c-Jun (Kumar, et al., 2013). Therefore, VEGF and EGFR are shared targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA. VEGF and EGFR inhibitors have emerged as critical therapies in several tumors and other diseases (Tabernero, 2007; Wang, et al., 2017). We speculate that VEGF and EGFR inhibitors could be beneficial medications for toxin impact. In this study, the key differences in predicted targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA lie in the specific pathways and functions they regulate. The targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 includes genes involved in neurotrophic signaling (BDNF) (Yang, et al., 2023), cell adhesion (DLG4), metabolic regulation (PPARG) (Ahmadian, et al., 2013), and hormone signaling (ESR1) (Gui, et al., 2025). The target of miRNAs by OTA focuses on the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (MAPK3, KRAS, JUN, MAPK1) (Guo, et al., 2020), cell shape and migration (CDC42) (Álvarez-Aznar, et al., 2025), and chromatin remodeling (EP300) (Fasano, et al., 2023). NOTCH1, VEGFA, and EGFR are common miRNA targets that regulate both AFB1 and OTA. These proteins are important in transcription regulation, receptor activation, and oncogenic activity (Koveitypour, et al., 2019; Troy, et al., 2013).\n\n## Conclusion\nIn this review, we summarized the role of miRNAs regulated in response to mycotoxins in several important organs, as well as the potential functions of miRNAs affected by AFB1 and OTA. The predicted biological roles of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA are strongly associated with neurotoxic effects. In addition, the potential co-targets of miRNAs regulated by AFB1 and OTA include VEGFA, EGFR, and NOTCH1. miRNAs are valuable for disease identification and prevention due to their role as distinctive biomarkers measurable in serum, saliva, and urine (Condrat, et al., 2020). Moreover, miRNA expression profiles can change in response to disease, providing a specific signature that can distinguish between healthy and diseased states. Despite this potential, a number of obstacles prevent miRNAs from being widely used in clinical settings as diagnostic biomarkers. One major obstacle is the standardization of pre-analytical and analytical procedures. Another challenge is the need for robust and validated detection methods (de Gonzalo-Calvo, et al., 2022). Although several methods, such as next-generation sequencing, microarray analysis, and quantitative real-time PCR are available, each method has limitations in terms of cost, sensitivity, specificity, and usability in a clinical context (Condrat, Thompson, Barbu, Bugnar, Boboc, Cretoiu, Suciu, Cretoiu and Voinea, 2020). Currently, while research continues to advance, miRNAs are not yet widely used as routine diagnostic markers in clinical practice. However, several miRNA-based diagnostic tests are currently under development or in clinical trials for specific diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders (Chakraborty, et al., 2021; Kim and Croce, 2023). Due to the widespread health hazards and economic burdens associated with mycotoxin exposure in both humans and animals, novel prognostic tools or strategies are crucial for the detection, prevention, and control of mycotoxin-associated problems. Therefore, this review serves as a resource for researchers and scientists working on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying mycotoxin toxicity and developing targeted interventions to prevent and control mycotoxin-related diseases.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\nEun Jung Sohn: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.
