  "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurological disease worldwide, with increases outpacing aging and occurring most rapidly in recently industrialized areas, suggesting a role of environmental factors. Epidemiological, post-mortem, and mechanistic studies suggest that persistent organic pollutants, including the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin, increase PD risk. In mice, developmental dieldrin exposure causes male-specific exacerbation of neuronal susceptibility to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and synucleinopathy. Specifically, in the α-synuclein (α-syn) pre-formed fibril (PFF) model, exposure leads to increased deficits in striatal dopamine (DA) turnover and motor deficits on the challenging beam. Here, we hypothesized that alterations in DA handling contribute to the observed changes and assessed vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) function and DA release in this dieldrin/PFF 2-hit model. Female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.3 mg/kg dieldrin or vehicle every 3 days by feeding, starting at 8 weeks of age and continuing throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation. Male offspring from independent litters underwent unilateral, intrastriatal injections of α-syn PFFs at 12 weeks of age, and vesicular  3 H-DA uptake assays and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry were performed 4 months post-PFF injection. Dieldrin-induced an increase in DA release in striatal slices in PFF-injected animals, but no change in VMAT2 activity. These results suggest that developmental dieldrin exposure increases a compensatory response to synucleinopathy-triggered striatal DA loss. These findings are consistent with silent neurotoxicity, where developmental exposure to dieldrin primes the nigrostriatal striatal system to have an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy in the absence of observable changes in typical markers of nigrostriatal dysfunction and degeneration.",

      "text": "Male (11 weeks old) and female (7 weeks old) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). Animal husbandry and colony maintenance was completed as previously described ( Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University.\n\nDosing was carried out as previously described ( Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). Adult C57BL/6 (8-week-old) female animals were treated throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation ( Figure 1A ). Mice were administered 0.3 mg/kg dieldrin (ChemService, CAS No. 60-57-1) dissolved in corn oil vehicle and mixed with peanut butter pellets every 3 days ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Gonzales  et al. , 2014 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). This dose was chosen based on a previous dose response study and our results in the 2-hit dieldrin/PFF model ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). Mice were exposed through oral ingestion by the dam because the most likely route of exposure to dieldrin in humans was through ingestion of contaminated foods and ingestion of the resulting contaminated breast milk ( ATSDR, 2022 ). Control mice received an equivalent amount of corn oil vehicle in peanut butter. Four weeks into female exposure, unexposed C57BL/6 males (8–12 weeks old) were introduced for breeding. Offspring were weaned at 3 weeks of age and separated by litter and by sex, with 2–4 animals per cage ( Figure 1B ). At 12 weeks of age, male offspring from independent litters were selected for PFF or monomer injection. This time point was chosen based on previous results demonstrating increased neuronal susceptibility to this age ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). This developmental dieldrin dosing paradigm has been previously used in our lab to study the role of epigenetics and the effects on synucleinopathy-induced toxicity ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ).\n\nExperimental design including dosing schedule, weaning strategy, cage, and group assignments. A, Timeline of dieldrin-PFF 2-hit model: At 8 weeks of age, female C57BL/6 mice dieldrin exposure began via oral administration of 0.3 mg/kg dissolved in corn oil and injected into peanut butter pellets. At 12 weeks of age, mating began, and exposure continued through weaning of pups. F1 pups were weaned 3 weeks after birth and separated by litter and sex (2–4 animals per cage). At 3 months of age, male pups underwent intrastriatal injections of PFFs and were individually housed after surgery. B, Cage, group assignments, and group numbers: Male F1 offspring (F1) that underwent intrastriatal PFF-injections were assigned to endpoints such that every animal for each endpoint came from an independent litter. The Fourth F1 litter is an example of a litter excluded from endpoint assignments due to individual housing.\n\nRecombinant mouse α-syn monomers and PFFs were provided by the Luk lab, stored at −80°C, and prepared as previously described ( Luk  et al. , 2012a ;  Patterson  et al. , 2019 ). Over 500 fibrils were measured to determine the average fibril length of 45.06 ± 14.7 nm ( Figure 2 ). Fibril length was assessed before and after surgeries to ensure that fibrils did not reaggregate over the duration of the surgeries. All measurements were performed with ImageJ ( Schneider  et al. , 2012 ).\n\nVerification of α-syn PFF size. A, PFF length distribution determined via TEM. Each point represents a measured fibril length, the error bars denote standard deviation. B, Representative TEM image of sonicated fibrils. C, Frequency distribution of PFF lengths post-sonication.\n\nAt 12 weeks of age, animals received unilateral intrastriatal PFF injections according to their cage and group assignment ( Figure 1B ). Surgeries were performed as previously described ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ). Mice received a total of 5 µg of PFFs (2.5 µl injection of 2 µg/µl PFFs) and received a single intrastriatal injection (anterior-posterior (AP) +0.2, medial-lateral (ML) +2.0, dorsal-ventral (DV) −2.6) with a flow rate of 0.5 μl/ml. Post-surgery, mice received 1 mg/kg of sustained release buprenorphine by subcutaneous injection and were monitored closely until they recovered from anesthesia. In the 3 days following recovery, animals were monitored daily for adverse outcomes. A small subset of animals ( n  = 2 for FSCV and  n  = 4 for uptake) received α-syn monomer injections as a negative control to ensure that there were no effects of surgery itself. Animals were singly housed following surgeries for the duration of the experiment, consistent with our previous study ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nAnimals were killed by cervical dislocation and hemisected. Half of the brain from each group was homogenized for each statistical n, and vesicular DA uptake was performed as previously described ( Bernstein  et al. , 2012 ;  Caudle  et al. , 2007 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Staal  et al. , 2000 ). Data were normalized to protein level determined by BCA assay and expressed as pmol DA/mg protein/minute.\n\nAnimals were killed by cervical dislocation and brains were sectioned in oxygenated, 4°C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 300 µm thick using a vibratome (Campden Instruments 5100mz-Plus) ( Ferris  et al. , 2014 ). FSCV was carried out in the lateral, dorsal striatal sections as previously described ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Ferris  et al. , 2014 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Ramsson, 2016 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ;  Yorgason  et al. , 2011 ).\n\nCarbon fiber glass microelectrodes were constructed using a vacuum to pull carbon fiber through a glass capillary tube, pulled using a horizontal electrode puller, broken, and sealed with paraffin ( Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ). Microelectrodes were cycled for at least 15 min prior to recording at a frequency of 60 Hz, then cycled at 10 Hz until stable ( Davis  et al. , 2020 ;  Ramsson, 2016 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ;  Takmakov  et al. , 2010 ). Carbon fiber microelectrodes were calibrated using a pipette-based calibration system by adding a dilute stock DA solution to a buffer and measuring the oxidation and/or reduction ( Ramsson, 2016 ). All cycling and recordings occurred with a triangle waveform (−0.4 to 1.3 V to −0.4 V; 400 V/s 10 Hz) ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Kang  et al. , 2021 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ). Dopamine release was elicited with a bipolar twisted electrode (PlasticsOne) and a 350 µA, 4 ms monophasic optically isolated stimulus pulse (Neurolog NL800). Data was collected and analyzed using Demon Voltammetry and Analysis Software (Wake Forest Innovations) ( Yorgason  et al. , 2011 ). A 5-recording survey of 2 different dorsal striatal release sites per hemisphere in 2 different slices was taken for each animal with a 5-min rest interval between each stimulation ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ). Peak Dopamine, upward velocity (DA release), downward velocity (uptake; a V max  estimate for DAT uptake), and tau (uptake; a K m  estimate for DAT uptake) were calculated for each recording ( Figure 4A ) ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ). Ipsilateral values were normalized to contralateral values to account for animal-to-animal variability.\n\nThe rostral remainder of the brains used for FSCV were immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and placed into 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for immunohistochemistry. Fixed brains were frozen on a sliding microtome and sliced at 40 μm coronally. Free-floating sections were stored in cryoprotectant (30% sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol, 0.05 M PBS) at −20°C. A 1:6 series of the entire rostral portion of the brain was used for staining and 2 nigral sections per animal were selected for imaging and quantification. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and sections were then incubated overnight in appropriate primary antibodies in TBS with 1% NGS/0.25% Triton X-100 followed by appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 hours ( Table 1 ). Slides were cover-slipped with VECTASHIELD Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (VectaLabs) with DAPI and imaged on a Zeiss AxioScan 7 Digital Slide Scanning Microscope. Analysis of pSyn counts for immunohistochemistry was completed using the object colocalization module in the HALO Image Analysis Platform (Indica Labs). The SNpc was manually traced as the region of interest based on TH staining and pSyn positive objects within this region were identified on 2 sections per animal from the same level.\n\nAntibodies used for immunohistochemistry\n\nStatistical analysis and graphing were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Vehicle-exposed animals injected with PFFs (Vehicle/PFF) and dieldrin-exposed animals injected with PFFs (Dieldrin/PFF) were compared with 2-tailed, unpaired- t -tests. All data are shown as mean ± SD and cutoff for statistical significance was  p  < .05. Monomer injected animals (Vehicle/Monomer, Dieldrin/Monomer) were used as controls to ensure there were not effects of surgery on its own, but these were not included in the statistical analysis, consistent with our preregistration and power analysis ( Bernstein and Boyd, 2022 )."

Peak Dopamine, upward velocity (DA release), downward velocity (uptake; a V max  estimate for DAT uptake), and tau (uptake; a K m  estimate for DAT uptake) were calculated for each recording ( Figure 4A ) ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ). Ipsilateral values were normalized to contralateral values to account for animal-to-animal variability.\n\nThe rostral remainder of the brains used for FSCV were immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and placed into 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for immunohistochemistry.

Adult C57BL/6 (8-week-old) female animals were treated throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation ( Figure 1A ). Mice were administered 0.3 mg/kg dieldrin (ChemService, CAS No. 60-57-1) dissolved in corn oil vehicle and mixed with peanut butter pellets every 3 days ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Gonzales  et al. , 2014 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). This dose was chosen based on a previous dose response study and our results in the 2-hit dieldrin/PFF model ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). Mice were exposed through oral ingestion by the dam because the most likely route of exposure to dieldrin in humans was through ingestion of contaminated foods and ingestion of the resulting contaminated breast milk ( ATSDR, 2022 ). Control mice received an equivalent amount of corn oil vehicle in peanut butter. Four weeks into female exposure, unexposed C57BL/6 males (8–12 weeks old) were introduced for breeding. Offspring were weaned at 3 weeks of age and separated by litter and by sex, with 2–4 animals per cage ( Figure 1B ). At 12 weeks of age, male offspring from independent litters were selected for PFF or monomer injection. This time point was chosen based on previous results demonstrating increased neuronal susceptibility to this age ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). This developmental dieldrin dosing paradigm has been previously used in our lab to study the role of epigenetics and the effects on synucleinopathy-induced toxicity ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ).\n\nExperimental design including dosing schedule, weaning strategy, cage, and group assignments. A, Timeline of dieldrin-PFF 2-hit model: At 8 weeks of age, female C57BL/6 mice dieldrin exposure began via oral administration of 0.3 mg/kg dissolved in corn oil and injected into peanut butter pellets. At 12 weeks of age, mating began, and exposure continued through weaning of pups. F1 pups were weaned 3 weeks after birth and separated by litter and sex (2–4 animals per cage). At 3 months of age, male pups underwent intrastriatal injections of PFFs and were individually housed after surgery. B, Cage, group assignments, and group numbers: Male F1 offspring (F1) that underwent intrastriatal PFF-injections were assigned to endpoints such that every animal for each endpoint came from an independent litter. The Fourth F1 litter is an example of a litter excluded from endpoint assignments due to individual housing."

      "text": "Based on the results reported here, we expand our model for how developmental dieldrin exposure leads to increased susceptibility to synucleinopathy-induced deficits in motor behavior ( Figures 6  and  7 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). In this model, exposure to dieldrin occurs during prenatal and postnatal development. The half-life of dieldrin in mouse brain is less than a week, so no detectable dieldrin remains in the brain of F1 offspring by a few weeks after weaning ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  World Health Organization & International Programme on Chemical Safety, 1989 ). When dieldrin is present in the developing brain, it is thought to act on developing DA neurons by inhibiting GABA A  receptor-mediated chloride flux, resulting in increased neuronal activity ( Lauder  et al. , 1998 ;  Liu  et al. , 1997 ;  Narahashi, 1996 ;  Narahashi  et al. , 1995 ;  Okada  et al. , 2004 ;  Paladini and Tepper, 1999 ). Based on previous results, we propose that this net increase in neuronal activity modifies the dopamine system through persistent sex-specific changes in epigenetic mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of genes important for dopamine neuron development and maintenance in the substantia nigra and for the neuroinflammatory system in the striatum ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). These changes alter the response of the nigrostriatal system to future insults via persistent alterations in striatal dopamine synapses that manifest as an early increase in compensatory mechanisms triggered by synucleinopathy-induced striatal DA loss in adult male mice ( Figure 6 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nOverview of developmental dieldrin/PFF 2-hit model.\n\nSummary of observed changes in the dieldrin PFF 2-hit model. Timelines show representative changes synuclein pathology, microglial activation, striatal loss, and nigral degeneration in the PFF model based on published literature, shown as the percent change in these markers compared to a saline/monomer injected mouse. Grey boxes indicate previous results from our lab in the dieldrin PFF 2-hit model. White boxes indicate FSCV and uptake results reported here at 4 months post-PFF injection. Light grey and dark grey squares represent results from vehicle: PFF and dieldrin: PFF animals, respectively.\n\nOur results are also consistent with the idea of silent neurotoxicity, where the effects of early life exposures are unmasked by challenges later in life, the cumulative effects of exposures over the lifespan, or the effects of aging ( Cory-Slechta  et al. , 2005 ;  Kraft  et al. , 2016 ). In such a paradigm, developmental exposure to dieldrin primes the nigrostriatal striatal system in male offspring to have an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy induced by α-syn PFFs in the absence of observable changes in typical markers of nigrostriatal dysfunction and degeneration. In support of this, our previous studies identified persistent epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in genes related to DAergic differentiation and maintenance in the midbrain and altered expression of neuroinflammatory genes in the striatum at 12 weeks of age following developmental dieldrin exposure ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). In a parallel study, we are also tracking the longitudinal patterns of dieldrin-induced epigenetic changes across the timeline of this entire 2-hit model from birth to 9 months of age to determine if dieldrin alters the trajectory of epigenetic changes across the lifespan.\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that exploring dieldrin-induced changes that produce this high susceptibility state are critical to advancing our understanding of how exposures contribute to increased risk of PD and underscore the need to study PD-related exposures across the lifespan, particularly during sensitive periods of neurodevelopment.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that developmental dieldrin exposure alters response to synucleinopathy and enhances DA release in PFF-injected male animals 4 months after PFF-injection ( Figure 4 ). These results are consistent with our previous observation of an exacerbated increasein DA turnover at 6 months, summarized in 7 ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). If more DA is released at this 4 months, but DAT and VMAT2 uptake velocities are unchanged, this could lead to the increased DA turnover observed at 6 month post-PFF injection ( Alter  et al. , 2013 ). Importantly, our current data were collected 4 months post-PFF injection while our previous data showed increase striatal DA turnover at 6 months, suggesting that this enhanced DA release precedes effects on DA turnover and motor behavior ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). Of note, in our previous study, we reported that pSyn aggregation at 1 and 2 months, the loss of total striatal DA and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, at 2 and 6 months post-PFF injection and loss of nigral DA neurons at 6 months were not affected by dieldrin exposure ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ) ( Figure 7 ). Taken together, despite similar levels of synucleinopathy-induced pathology and total tissue DA levels in dieldrin and vehicle exposed animals, dieldrin exposed animals display an increase in evoked DA release at 4 months post-PFF injection.\n\nWhile FSCV has been utilized in α-syn knockout and α-syn overexpressing models, to our knowledge, this is the first study to perform FSCV in either the dieldrin or α-syn PFF mouse model with intrastriatal injection ( Somayaji  et al. , 2020 ;  Threlfell  et al. , 2021 ;  Yavich  et al. , 2004 ). A previous paper performed FSCV in the mouse α-syn PFF model via intranigral injections at 2- and 5 months of age and reported decreased DA release in older animals only at 1- and 2 months post-injection (Sun  et al. , 2021). These and other studies in different α-syn models indicate a critical role for a-syn in DA release, synaptic vesicle fusion, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of synaptic vesicle pool size ( Abeliovich  et al. , 2000 ;  Bellani  et al. , 2010 ;  Cheng  et al. , 2011 ;  Dagra  et al. , 2021 ;  Ingelsson, 2016 ;  Murphy  et al. , 2000 ;  Volles  et al. , 2001 ;  Xilouri  et al. , 2013 ). Given that we did not observe any effect of dieldrin or PFF alone on DA release, dieldrin exposure appears to cause changes in the synaptic terminal that prime the nigrostriatal system for an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy and striatal DA loss, resulting in early enhanced DA release and an eventual increase DA turnover ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). Early nigrostriatal compensatory changes are well-documented in human PD, multiple animal models of DA deficits, and more recently in a model of other monoaminergic (norepinephrine) loss ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1994 ,  1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1998 ,  1989 ). Together, this suggests that dieldrin induces changes in the synaptic terminal that increase the compensatory response to early synucleinopathy-induced striatal DA loss that contributes to greater long-term increases in DA turnover due to increases in cytosolic DA, the resulting oxidative stress, and acceleration of the toxic interplay between dysregulated α-syn and DA ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1989 ,  1998 ). Such a relationship between DA and α-syn is well-established and interfering with either can lead to a cycle of neurotoxicity where DA and α-syn interact and exacerbate the toxic effects of one another ( Nemani  et al. , 2010 ;  Roy, 2017 ;  Peng  et al. , 2005 ;  Perez  et al. , 2002 ;  Tehranian  et al. , 2006 ;  Venda  et al. , 2010 ;  Yavich  et al. , 2004 ).\n\nWe expected to see a relative increase in DAT function compared to VMAT2 function 4 months after PFF injection that was greater in animals developmentally exposed to dieldrin that would lead to increased cytosolic DA and DA turnover and explain the dieldrin-induced exacerbation of synucleinopathy-induced changes in DA turnover ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). However, we did not observe any dieldrin related effect on VMAT2 uptake in PFF-injected animals ( Figure 5 ). It is possible that there is an effect on VMAT2 uptake velocity in the intact system that was not observed here due to methodology. Specifically, isolating synaptic vesicles for this assay removes them from their biological context and measures persistent changes in function ( Caudle  et al. , 2007 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ,  2015 ,  2016 ). In addition, this assay involves homogenizing the entire hemisphere of the brain, so effects may be diluted by DAergic vesicles from areas of the brain not affected in our PFF model, including unaffected terminals within the striatum. Thus, this assay may not have the sensitivity to detect a small change in this small subpopulation of terminals. Unfortunately, technical limitations preclude us from performing this assay on unilateral striata from mouse brain.\n\nIt is also possible to increase the relative levels of DAT to VMAT2 function by affecting DAT function without alerting VMAT2 function. Multiple prior studies show that both dieldrin and PFFs can impact DAT expression and function ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  Sossi  et al. , 2022 ). Specifically, developmental dieldrin exposure was previously reported to lead to increases in striatal DAT levels at 12 weeks of age and changes in the DAT/VMAT2 ratio, but we did not observe the same effect in our previous study ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). In the mouse PFF model, striatal DAT protein expression at 6 months post-PFF injection in C57BL/6 mice was observed, but not at 1- and 3 months ( Luk  et al. , 2012a ). Thus, it is possible that dieldrin-induced increases in striatal DAT function lead to a less severe loss of DAT following PFF-induced synucleinopathy and a relative increase of DAT to VMAT2 function. However, we observed no change in DAT uptake in this study as measured by Tau and downward velocity, measures of DAT K m  and V max , from FSCV data ( Figure 4 ). Thus, it is possible that if more DA is released, but neither DAT- nor VMAT2-mediated uptake velocity is changed, the observed increase in turnover is due to both intracellular breakdown and extracellular metabolism of DA. Despite these caveats regarding VMAT2 and DAT uptake, this new data is consistent with our previous results in this 2-hit model showing no increase in α-syn pathology but an enhanced response to synucleinopathy in dieldrin exposed F1 male offspring ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nContrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe a synucleinopathy-induced decrease in DA release despite approximately 45% loss of total striatal DA levels 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ). This discrepancy is likely due to methodological differences and the underlying biology of DA neurons. HPLC measures total tissue DA levels from tissue punches, while FSCV measures extracellular DA only from the area immediately surrounding the electrode. Biologically, while there is a significant loss of total tissue DA at 2 months post-PFF injection, reductions in DA release at these synapses may be delayed relative to this loss. Most striatal DA synapses are silent, and the majority of synaptic vesicles are located within the reserve pool rather than the readily releasable pool ( Goldstein, 2012 ,  2013 ,  2021 ;  Sulzer  et al. , 2016 ;  Trudeau  et al. , 2014 ). Additionally, within the striatum of PFF-injected animals, we expect only a third to a half of terminals to be affected. Together, this leaves a pool of both surviving neurons and vesicles within affected neurons to maintain DA release. Consistent with this, we previously observed only mild PFF-associated effects on motor behavior at 4 months post-PFF injection, suggesting that DA release is maintained even with 45% loss of total striatal DA at 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). In line with this, it is generally accepted that DA-related symptoms in human PD do not present until at least 30% of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway are lost, suggesting that remaining neurons release sufficient quantities of DA despite loss of total DA ( Cheng  et al. , 2010 )."

In this model, exposure to dieldrin occurs during prenatal and postnatal development. The half-life of dieldrin in mouse brain is less than a week, so no detectable dieldrin remains in the brain of F1 offspring by a few weeks after weaning ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  World Health Organization & International Programme on Chemical Safety, 1989 ). When dieldrin is present in the developing brain, it is thought to act on developing DA neurons by inhibiting GABA A  receptor-mediated chloride flux, resulting in increased neuronal activity ( Lauder  et al. , 1998 ;  Liu  et al. , 1997 ;  Narahashi, 1996 ;  Narahashi  et al. , 1995 ;  Okada  et al. , 2004 ;  Paladini and Tepper, 1999 ).

These results are consistent with our previous observation of an exacerbated increasein DA turnover at 6 months, summarized in 7 ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).

A previous paper performed FSCV in the mouse α-syn PFF model via intranigral injections at 2- and 5 months of age and reported decreased DA release in older animals only at 1- and 2 months post-injection (Sun  et al. , 2021). These and other studies in different α-syn models indicate a critical role for a-syn in DA release, synaptic vesicle fusion, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of synaptic vesicle pool size ( Abeliovich  et al. , 2000 ;  Bellani  et al. , 2010 ;  Cheng  et al. , 2011 ;  Dagra  et al. , 2021 ;  Ingelsson, 2016 ;  Murphy  et al. , 2000 ;  Volles  et al. , 2001 ;  Xilouri  et al. , 2013 ).

A previous paper performed FSCV in the mouse α-syn PFF model via intranigral injections at 2- and 5 months of age and reported decreased DA release in older animals only at 1- and 2 months post-injection (Sun  et al. , 2021). These and other studies in different α-syn models indicate a critical role for a-syn in DA release, synaptic vesicle fusion, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of synaptic vesicle pool size ( Abeliovich  et al. , 2000 ;  Bellani  et al. , 2010 ;  Cheng  et al. , 2011 ;  Dagra  et al. , 2021 ;  Ingelsson, 2016 ;  Murphy  et al. , 2000 ;  Volles  et al. , 2001 ;  Xilouri  et al. , 2013 ). Given that we did not observe any effect of dieldrin or PFF alone on DA release, dieldrin exposure appears to cause changes in the synaptic terminal that prime the nigrostriatal system for an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy and striatal DA loss, resulting in early enhanced DA release and an eventual increase DA turnover ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). Early nigrostriatal compensatory changes are well-documented in human PD, multiple animal models of DA deficits, and more recently in a model of other monoaminergic (norepinephrine) loss ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1994 ,  1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1998 ,  1989 ). Together, this suggests that dieldrin induces changes in the synaptic terminal that increase the compensatory response to early synucleinopathy-induced striatal DA loss that contributes to greater long-term increases in DA turnover due to increases in cytosolic DA, the resulting oxidative stress, and acceleration of the toxic interplay between dysregulated α-syn and DA ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1989 ,  1998 ). Such a relationship between DA and α-syn is well-established and interfering with either can lead to a cycle of neurotoxicity where DA and α-syn interact and exacerbate the toxic effects of one another ( Nemani  et al. , 2010 ;  Roy, 2017 ;  Peng  et al. , 2005 ;  Perez  et al. , 2002 ;  Tehranian  et al. , 2006 ;  Venda  et al. , 2010 ;  Yavich  et al. , 2004 )."

      "title": "Developmental dieldrin exposure does not affect DAT- or VMAT2-mediated uptake in PFF-injected animals",
      "text": "We expected to see a relative increase in DAT function compared to VMAT2 function 4 months after PFF injection that was greater in animals developmentally exposed to dieldrin that would lead to increased cytosolic DA and DA turnover and explain the dieldrin-induced exacerbation of synucleinopathy-induced changes in DA turnover ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). However, we did not observe any dieldrin related effect on VMAT2 uptake in PFF-injected animals ( Figure 5 ). It is possible that there is an effect on VMAT2 uptake velocity in the intact system that was not observed here due to methodology. Specifically, isolating synaptic vesicles for this assay removes them from their biological context and measures persistent changes in function ( Caudle  et al. , 2007 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ,  2015 ,  2016 ). In addition, this assay involves homogenizing the entire hemisphere of the brain, so effects may be diluted by DAergic vesicles from areas of the brain not affected in our PFF model, including unaffected terminals within the striatum. Thus, this assay may not have the sensitivity to detect a small change in this small subpopulation of terminals. Unfortunately, technical limitations preclude us from performing this assay on unilateral striata from mouse brain.\n\nIt is also possible to increase the relative levels of DAT to VMAT2 function by affecting DAT function without alerting VMAT2 function. Multiple prior studies show that both dieldrin and PFFs can impact DAT expression and function ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  Sossi  et al. , 2022 ). Specifically, developmental dieldrin exposure was previously reported to lead to increases in striatal DAT levels at 12 weeks of age and changes in the DAT/VMAT2 ratio, but we did not observe the same effect in our previous study ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). In the mouse PFF model, striatal DAT protein expression at 6 months post-PFF injection in C57BL/6 mice was observed, but not at 1- and 3 months ( Luk  et al. , 2012a ). Thus, it is possible that dieldrin-induced increases in striatal DAT function lead to a less severe loss of DAT following PFF-induced synucleinopathy and a relative increase of DAT to VMAT2 function. However, we observed no change in DAT uptake in this study as measured by Tau and downward velocity, measures of DAT K m  and V max , from FSCV data ( Figure 4 ). Thus, it is possible that if more DA is released, but neither DAT- nor VMAT2-mediated uptake velocity is changed, the observed increase in turnover is due to both intracellular breakdown and extracellular metabolism of DA. Despite these caveats regarding VMAT2 and DAT uptake, this new data is consistent with our previous results in this 2-hit model showing no increase in α-syn pathology but an enhanced response to synucleinopathy in dieldrin exposed F1 male offspring ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 )."

      "title": "Synucleinopathy alone does not affect DA release 4 months after PFF injection",
      "text": "Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe a synucleinopathy-induced decrease in DA release despite approximately 45% loss of total striatal DA levels 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ). This discrepancy is likely due to methodological differences and the underlying biology of DA neurons. HPLC measures total tissue DA levels from tissue punches, while FSCV measures extracellular DA only from the area immediately surrounding the electrode. Biologically, while there is a significant loss of total tissue DA at 2 months post-PFF injection, reductions in DA release at these synapses may be delayed relative to this loss. Most striatal DA synapses are silent, and the majority of synaptic vesicles are located within the reserve pool rather than the readily releasable pool ( Goldstein, 2012 ,  2013 ,  2021 ;  Sulzer  et al. , 2016 ;  Trudeau  et al. , 2014 ). Additionally, within the striatum of PFF-injected animals, we expect only a third to a half of terminals to be affected. Together, this leaves a pool of both surviving neurons and vesicles within affected neurons to maintain DA release. Consistent with this, we previously observed only mild PFF-associated effects on motor behavior at 4 months post-PFF injection, suggesting that DA release is maintained even with 45% loss of total striatal DA at 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). In line with this, it is generally accepted that DA-related symptoms in human PD do not present until at least 30% of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway are lost, suggesting that remaining neurons release sufficient quantities of DA despite loss of total DA ( Cheng  et al. , 2010 )."

  "full_text": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurological disease worldwide, with increases outpacing aging and occurring most rapidly in recently industrialized areas, suggesting a role of environmental factors. Epidemiological, post-mortem, and mechanistic studies suggest that persistent organic pollutants, including the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin, increase PD risk. In mice, developmental dieldrin exposure causes male-specific exacerbation of neuronal susceptibility to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and synucleinopathy. Specifically, in the α-synuclein (α-syn) pre-formed fibril (PFF) model, exposure leads to increased deficits in striatal dopamine (DA) turnover and motor deficits on the challenging beam. Here, we hypothesized that alterations in DA handling contribute to the observed changes and assessed vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) function and DA release in this dieldrin/PFF 2-hit model. Female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.3 mg/kg dieldrin or vehicle every 3 days by feeding, starting at 8 weeks of age and continuing throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation. Male offspring from independent litters underwent unilateral, intrastriatal injections of α-syn PFFs at 12 weeks of age, and vesicular  3 H-DA uptake assays and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry were performed 4 months post-PFF injection. Dieldrin-induced an increase in DA release in striatal slices in PFF-injected animals, but no change in VMAT2 activity. These results suggest that developmental dieldrin exposure increases a compensatory response to synucleinopathy-triggered striatal DA loss. These findings are consistent with silent neurotoxicity, where developmental exposure to dieldrin primes the nigrostriatal striatal system to have an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy in the absence of observable changes in typical markers of nigrostriatal dysfunction and degeneration.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nMale (11 weeks old) and female (7 weeks old) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). Animal husbandry and colony maintenance was completed as previously described ( Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University.\n\nDosing was carried out as previously described ( Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). Adult C57BL/6 (8-week-old) female animals were treated throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation ( Figure 1A ). Mice were administered 0.3 mg/kg dieldrin (ChemService, CAS No. 60-57-1) dissolved in corn oil vehicle and mixed with peanut butter pellets every 3 days ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Gonzales  et al. , 2014 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). This dose was chosen based on a previous dose response study and our results in the 2-hit dieldrin/PFF model ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). Mice were exposed through oral ingestion by the dam because the most likely route of exposure to dieldrin in humans was through ingestion of contaminated foods and ingestion of the resulting contaminated breast milk ( ATSDR, 2022 ). Control mice received an equivalent amount of corn oil vehicle in peanut butter. Four weeks into female exposure, unexposed C57BL/6 males (8–12 weeks old) were introduced for breeding. Offspring were weaned at 3 weeks of age and separated by litter and by sex, with 2–4 animals per cage ( Figure 1B ). At 12 weeks of age, male offspring from independent litters were selected for PFF or monomer injection. This time point was chosen based on previous results demonstrating increased neuronal susceptibility to this age ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). This developmental dieldrin dosing paradigm has been previously used in our lab to study the role of epigenetics and the effects on synucleinopathy-induced toxicity ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ).\n\nExperimental design including dosing schedule, weaning strategy, cage, and group assignments. A, Timeline of dieldrin-PFF 2-hit model: At 8 weeks of age, female C57BL/6 mice dieldrin exposure began via oral administration of 0.3 mg/kg dissolved in corn oil and injected into peanut butter pellets. At 12 weeks of age, mating began, and exposure continued through weaning of pups. F1 pups were weaned 3 weeks after birth and separated by litter and sex (2–4 animals per cage). At 3 months of age, male pups underwent intrastriatal injections of PFFs and were individually housed after surgery. B, Cage, group assignments, and group numbers: Male F1 offspring (F1) that underwent intrastriatal PFF-injections were assigned to endpoints such that every animal for each endpoint came from an independent litter. The Fourth F1 litter is an example of a litter excluded from endpoint assignments due to individual housing.\n\nRecombinant mouse α-syn monomers and PFFs were provided by the Luk lab, stored at −80°C, and prepared as previously described ( Luk  et al. , 2012a ;  Patterson  et al. , 2019 ). Over 500 fibrils were measured to determine the average fibril length of 45.06 ± 14.7 nm ( Figure 2 ). Fibril length was assessed before and after surgeries to ensure that fibrils did not reaggregate over the duration of the surgeries. All measurements were performed with ImageJ ( Schneider  et al. , 2012 ).\n\nVerification of α-syn PFF size. A, PFF length distribution determined via TEM. Each point represents a measured fibril length, the error bars denote standard deviation. B, Representative TEM image of sonicated fibrils. C, Frequency distribution of PFF lengths post-sonication.\n\nAt 12 weeks of age, animals received unilateral intrastriatal PFF injections according to their cage and group assignment ( Figure 1B ). Surgeries were performed as previously described ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ). Mice received a total of 5 µg of PFFs (2.5 µl injection of 2 µg/µl PFFs) and received a single intrastriatal injection (anterior-posterior (AP) +0.2, medial-lateral (ML) +2.0, dorsal-ventral (DV) −2.6) with a flow rate of 0.5 μl/ml. Post-surgery, mice received 1 mg/kg of sustained release buprenorphine by subcutaneous injection and were monitored closely until they recovered from anesthesia. In the 3 days following recovery, animals were monitored daily for adverse outcomes. A small subset of animals ( n  = 2 for FSCV and  n  = 4 for uptake) received α-syn monomer injections as a negative control to ensure that there were no effects of surgery itself. Animals were singly housed following surgeries for the duration of the experiment, consistent with our previous study ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nAnimals were killed by cervical dislocation and hemisected. Half of the brain from each group was homogenized for each statistical n, and vesicular DA uptake was performed as previously described ( Bernstein  et al. , 2012 ;  Caudle  et al. , 2007 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Staal  et al. , 2000 ). Data were normalized to protein level determined by BCA assay and expressed as pmol DA/mg protein/minute.\n\nAnimals were killed by cervical dislocation and brains were sectioned in oxygenated, 4°C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 300 µm thick using a vibratome (Campden Instruments 5100mz-Plus) ( Ferris  et al. , 2014 ). FSCV was carried out in the lateral, dorsal striatal sections as previously described ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Ferris  et al. , 2014 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Ramsson, 2016 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ;  Yorgason  et al. , 2011 ).\n\nCarbon fiber glass microelectrodes were constructed using a vacuum to pull carbon fiber through a glass capillary tube, pulled using a horizontal electrode puller, broken, and sealed with paraffin ( Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ). Microelectrodes were cycled for at least 15 min prior to recording at a frequency of 60 Hz, then cycled at 10 Hz until stable ( Davis  et al. , 2020 ;  Ramsson, 2016 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ;  Takmakov  et al. , 2010 ). Carbon fiber microelectrodes were calibrated using a pipette-based calibration system by adding a dilute stock DA solution to a buffer and measuring the oxidation and/or reduction ( Ramsson, 2016 ). All cycling and recordings occurred with a triangle waveform (−0.4 to 1.3 V to −0.4 V; 400 V/s 10 Hz) ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Kang  et al. , 2021 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ). Dopamine release was elicited with a bipolar twisted electrode (PlasticsOne) and a 350 µA, 4 ms monophasic optically isolated stimulus pulse (Neurolog NL800). Data was collected and analyzed using Demon Voltammetry and Analysis Software (Wake Forest Innovations) ( Yorgason  et al. , 2011 ). A 5-recording survey of 2 different dorsal striatal release sites per hemisphere in 2 different slices was taken for each animal with a 5-min rest interval between each stimulation ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ). Peak Dopamine, upward velocity (DA release), downward velocity (uptake; a V max  estimate for DAT uptake), and tau (uptake; a K m  estimate for DAT uptake) were calculated for each recording ( Figure 4A ) ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ). Ipsilateral values were normalized to contralateral values to account for animal-to-animal variability.\n\nThe rostral remainder of the brains used for FSCV were immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and placed into 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for immunohistochemistry. Fixed brains were frozen on a sliding microtome and sliced at 40 μm coronally. Free-floating sections were stored in cryoprotectant (30% sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol, 0.05 M PBS) at −20°C. A 1:6 series of the entire rostral portion of the brain was used for staining and 2 nigral sections per animal were selected for imaging and quantification. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and sections were then incubated overnight in appropriate primary antibodies in TBS with 1% NGS/0.25% Triton X-100 followed by appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 hours ( Table 1 ). Slides were cover-slipped with VECTASHIELD Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (VectaLabs) with DAPI and imaged on a Zeiss AxioScan 7 Digital Slide Scanning Microscope. Analysis of pSyn counts for immunohistochemistry was completed using the object colocalization module in the HALO Image Analysis Platform (Indica Labs). The SNpc was manually traced as the region of interest based on TH staining and pSyn positive objects within this region were identified on 2 sections per animal from the same level.\n\nAntibodies used for immunohistochemistry\n\nStatistical analysis and graphing were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Vehicle-exposed animals injected with PFFs (Vehicle/PFF) and dieldrin-exposed animals injected with PFFs (Dieldrin/PFF) were compared with 2-tailed, unpaired- t -tests. All data are shown as mean ± SD and cutoff for statistical significance was  p  < .05. Monomer injected animals (Vehicle/Monomer, Dieldrin/Monomer) were used as controls to ensure there were not effects of surgery on its own, but these were not included in the statistical analysis, consistent with our preregistration and power analysis ( Bernstein and Boyd, 2022 ).\n\n## \n\nMale (11 weeks old) and female (7 weeks old) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine).

Monomer injected animals (Vehicle/Monomer, Dieldrin/Monomer) were used as controls to ensure there were not effects of surgery on its own, but these were not included in the statistical analysis, consistent with our preregistration and power analysis ( Bernstein and Boyd, 2022 ).\n\n## \n\nMale (11 weeks old) and female (7 weeks old) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). Animal husbandry and colony maintenance was completed as previously described ( Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University.\n\nDosing was carried out as previously described ( Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). Adult C57BL/6 (8-week-old) female animals were treated throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation ( Figure 1A ). Mice were administered 0.3 mg/kg dieldrin (ChemService, CAS No. 60-57-1) dissolved in corn oil vehicle and mixed with peanut butter pellets every 3 days ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Gonzales  et al. , 2014 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). This dose was chosen based on a previous dose response study and our results in the 2-hit dieldrin/PFF model ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). Mice were exposed through oral ingestion by the dam because the most likely route of exposure to dieldrin in humans was through ingestion of contaminated foods and ingestion of the resulting contaminated breast milk ( ATSDR, 2022 ). Control mice received an equivalent amount of corn oil vehicle in peanut butter. Four weeks into female exposure, unexposed C57BL/6 males (8–12 weeks old) were introduced for breeding. Offspring were weaned at 3 weeks of age and separated by litter and by sex, with 2–4 animals per cage ( Figure 1B ). At 12 weeks of age, male offspring from independent litters were selected for PFF or monomer injection. This time point was chosen based on previous results demonstrating increased neuronal susceptibility to this age ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). This developmental dieldrin dosing paradigm has been previously used in our lab to study the role of epigenetics and the effects on synucleinopathy-induced toxicity ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ).\n\nExperimental design including dosing schedule, weaning strategy, cage, and group assignments. A, Timeline of dieldrin-PFF 2-hit model: At 8 weeks of age, female C57BL/6 mice dieldrin exposure began via oral administration of 0.3 mg/kg dissolved in corn oil and injected into peanut butter pellets. At 12 weeks of age, mating began, and exposure continued through weaning of pups. F1 pups were weaned 3 weeks after birth and separated by litter and sex (2–4 animals per cage). At 3 months of age, male pups underwent intrastriatal injections of PFFs and were individually housed after surgery. B, Cage, group assignments, and group numbers: Male F1 offspring (F1) that underwent intrastriatal PFF-injections were assigned to endpoints such that every animal for each endpoint came from an independent litter. The Fourth F1 litter is an example of a litter excluded from endpoint assignments due to individual housing.\n\nRecombinant mouse α-syn monomers and PFFs were provided by the Luk lab, stored at −80°C, and prepared as previously described ( Luk  et al. , 2012a ;  Patterson  et al. , 2019 ). Over 500 fibrils were measured to determine the average fibril length of 45.06 ± 14.7 nm ( Figure 2 ). Fibril length was assessed before and after surgeries to ensure that fibrils did not reaggregate over the duration of the surgeries. All measurements were performed with ImageJ ( Schneider  et al. , 2012 ).\n\nVerification of α-syn PFF size. A, PFF length distribution determined via TEM. Each point represents a measured fibril length, the error bars denote standard deviation. B, Representative TEM image of sonicated fibrils. C, Frequency distribution of PFF lengths post-sonication.\n\nAt 12 weeks of age, animals received unilateral intrastriatal PFF injections according to their cage and group assignment ( Figure 1B ). Surgeries were performed as previously described ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ). Mice received a total of 5 µg of PFFs (2.5 µl injection of 2 µg/µl PFFs) and received a single intrastriatal injection (anterior-posterior (AP) +0.2, medial-lateral (ML) +2.0, dorsal-ventral (DV) −2.6) with a flow rate of 0.5 μl/ml. Post-surgery, mice received 1 mg/kg of sustained release buprenorphine by subcutaneous injection and were monitored closely until they recovered from anesthesia. In the 3 days following recovery, animals were monitored daily for adverse outcomes. A small subset of animals ( n  = 2 for FSCV and  n  = 4 for uptake) received α-syn monomer injections as a negative control to ensure that there were no effects of surgery itself. Animals were singly housed following surgeries for the duration of the experiment, consistent with our previous study ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nAnimals were killed by cervical dislocation and hemisected. Half of the brain from each group was homogenized for each statistical n, and vesicular DA uptake was performed as previously described ( Bernstein  et al. , 2012 ;  Caudle  et al. , 2007 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Staal  et al. , 2000 ). Data were normalized to protein level determined by BCA assay and expressed as pmol DA/mg protein/minute.\n\nAnimals were killed by cervical dislocation and brains were sectioned in oxygenated, 4°C artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at 300 µm thick using a vibratome (Campden Instruments 5100mz-Plus) ( Ferris  et al. , 2014 ). FSCV was carried out in the lateral, dorsal striatal sections as previously described ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Ferris  et al. , 2014 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Ramsson, 2016 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ;  Yorgason  et al. , 2011 ).\n\nCarbon fiber glass microelectrodes were constructed using a vacuum to pull carbon fiber through a glass capillary tube, pulled using a horizontal electrode puller, broken, and sealed with paraffin ( Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ). Microelectrodes were cycled for at least 15 min prior to recording at a frequency of 60 Hz, then cycled at 10 Hz until stable ( Davis  et al. , 2020 ;  Ramsson, 2016 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ;  Takmakov  et al. , 2010 ). Carbon fiber microelectrodes were calibrated using a pipette-based calibration system by adding a dilute stock DA solution to a buffer and measuring the oxidation and/or reduction ( Ramsson, 2016 ). All cycling and recordings occurred with a triangle waveform (−0.4 to 1.3 V to −0.4 V; 400 V/s 10 Hz) ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Kang  et al. , 2021 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ;  Ramsson  et al. , 2015 ). Dopamine release was elicited with a bipolar twisted electrode (PlasticsOne) and a 350 µA, 4 ms monophasic optically isolated stimulus pulse (Neurolog NL800). Data was collected and analyzed using Demon Voltammetry and Analysis Software (Wake Forest Innovations) ( Yorgason  et al. , 2011 ). A 5-recording survey of 2 different dorsal striatal release sites per hemisphere in 2 different slices was taken for each animal with a 5-min rest interval between each stimulation ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ). Peak Dopamine, upward velocity (DA release), downward velocity (uptake; a V max  estimate for DAT uptake), and tau (uptake; a K m  estimate for DAT uptake) were calculated for each recording ( Figure 4A ) ( Everett  et al. , 2022 ). Ipsilateral values were normalized to contralateral values to account for animal-to-animal variability.\n\nThe rostral remainder of the brains used for FSCV were immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and placed into 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C for immunohistochemistry. Fixed brains were frozen on a sliding microtome and sliced at 40 μm coronally. Free-floating sections were stored in cryoprotectant (30% sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol, 0.05 M PBS) at −20°C. A 1:6 series of the entire rostral portion of the brain was used for staining and 2 nigral sections per animal were selected for imaging and quantification. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 10% normal goat serum, and sections were then incubated overnight in appropriate primary antibodies in TBS with 1% NGS/0.25% Triton X-100 followed by appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 hours ( Table 1 ). Slides were cover-slipped with VECTASHIELD Vibrance Antifade Mounting Medium (VectaLabs) with DAPI and imaged on a Zeiss AxioScan 7 Digital Slide Scanning Microscope. Analysis of pSyn counts for immunohistochemistry was completed using the object colocalization module in the HALO Image Analysis Platform (Indica Labs). The SNpc was manually traced as the region of interest based on TH staining and pSyn positive objects within this region were identified on 2 sections per animal from the same level.\n\nAntibodies used for immunohistochemistry\n\nStatistical analysis and graphing were performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Vehicle-exposed animals injected with PFFs (Vehicle/PFF) and dieldrin-exposed animals injected with PFFs (Dieldrin/PFF) were compared with 2-tailed, unpaired- t -tests. All data are shown as mean ± SD and cutoff for statistical significance was  p  < .05. Monomer injected animals (Vehicle/Monomer, Dieldrin/Monomer) were used as controls to ensure there were not effects of surgery on its own, but these were not included in the statistical analysis, consistent with our preregistration and power analysis ( Bernstein and Boyd, 2022 ).\n\n## Animals\n\nMale (11 weeks old) and female (7 weeks old) C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine).

All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University.\n\n## Dieldrin exposure paradigm\n\nDosing was carried out as previously described ( Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). Adult C57BL/6 (8-week-old) female animals were treated throughout breeding, gestation, and lactation ( Figure 1A ).

We were unable to confirm seeding in animals used for uptake since the entire brain was used for that assay. We confirmed seeding in all animals used for FSCV and counted the number of pSyn-positive objects. At 4 months post-injection, as expected, we observed pSyn positive inclusions ipsilateral, but not contralateral, SN, in both dieldrin and vehicle/PFF groups ( Figs. 3A and 3B ). Consistent with previous results, dieldrin did not affect the number of pSyn-positive inclusions ( Figure 3C ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nConfirmation of PFF-induced seeding in FSCV animals. A, Representative images from nigral tissue sections stained with TH (top panels) and pSyn (middle panels) from a vehicle/PFF (A) and dieldrin/PFF (B) animals 4 months post-PFF injection. C, pSyn counts in the SNpc show no effect of dieldrin on pSyn-positive objects in the SNpc ipsilateral to the PFF injection ( p  = .2441). D, As expected, there were no pSyn-positive objects contralateral to the injection in either group of animals. All data are shown as mean ± SD.\n\nFSCV was performed in striatal slices to determine if developmental dieldrin exposure affects evoked DA release or uptake in PFF-injected animals 4 months after PFF injection ( Figs. 4A–D ). There was a significant increase in both peak DA concentration and upward velocity, a measure of DA release, in the dieldrin/PFF group compared to the vehicle/PFF group ( p =  .0394 and  p =  .0434, respectively) ( Figs. 4E and 4F ). However, there was no significant difference in DAT uptake as measure by tau or downward velocity, which are measures of DAT K m  and V max  ( p =  .6435 and .5303, respectively) ( Figs. 4G and 4H ). Calculated values are shown in  Table 2 . We verified that there was no difference in any metric on the contralateral side to confirm that dieldrin alone had no effect on DA release or uptake ( Supplementary Figs. 1A–D ). We also compared ipsilateral to contralateral metrics in the vehicle/PFF group to and observed no significant effect of PFFs alone ( Supplementary Figs 1E and 1H ). Monomer injected animals in both the vehicle and dieldrin exposed groups showed similar outcomes on all FSCV metrics.\n\nDieldrin/PFFs increase peak dopamine and upward velocity in striatal tissues measured using FSCV. Four months post-PFF injection, animals were killed and FSCV was performed in dorsal striatum. A, Example dopamine versus time graph showing each quantified metric.

A color version of this figure appears in the online version of this article.\n\nFSCV values (ipsilateral/contralateral) for vehicle/PFF and dieldrin/PFF groups (mean ± standard deviation)\n\nTo determine if dieldrin exposure alters VMAT2 function in PFF-injected animals, uptake assays were performed at 4 months post-PFF injection. Somewhat surprisingly, there was no difference in VMAT2-mediated uptake velocity between the vehicle/PFF and the dieldrin/PFF groups ipsilateral to injection site ( Figure 5 ). As expected, there was no difference in uptake contralateral to the injection site, showing that dieldrin alone had no effect on uptake velocity ( Supplementary Figure 2A ). In addition, uptake was equivalent between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides within the vehicle/PFF group, demonstrating no significant effect of PFFs alone ( Supplementary Figure 2B ). Observed uptake velocity was consistent with previously published values for VMAT2 uptake velocity in WT C57BL/6 mice ( Lohr  et al. , 2014 ). Vehicle and dieldrin exposed animals injected with monomer showed similar VMAT2 uptake velocity in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the injection (vehicle/monomer: 7.020 ± 2.224 pmol/mg/min,  n  = 4; dieldrin/monomer: 5.460 ± 1.678 pmol/mg/min,  n  = 4).\n\nDieldrin does not affect VMAT2 uptake velocity in PFF-injected male F1 offspring.

All data shown as mean ± SD.\n\n## Confirmation of PFF-induced seeding of pSyn-positive aggregates\n\nTo confirm PFF-induced seeding, nigral slices were stained for TH and phosphorylated-synuclein (pSyn) from the remaining tissue of brains used for FSCV. We were unable to confirm seeding in animals used for uptake since the entire brain was used for that assay. We confirmed seeding in all animals used for FSCV and counted the number of pSyn-positive objects. At 4 months post-injection, as expected, we observed pSyn positive inclusions ipsilateral, but not contralateral, SN, in both dieldrin and vehicle/PFF groups ( Figs. 3A and 3B ). Consistent with previous results, dieldrin did not affect the number of pSyn-positive inclusions ( Figure 3C ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nConfirmation of PFF-induced seeding in FSCV animals.

D, As expected, there were no pSyn-positive objects contralateral to the injection in either group of animals. All data are shown as mean ± SD.\n\n## Developmental dieldrin exposure increases DA release in PFF-injected animals\n\nFSCV was performed in striatal slices to determine if developmental dieldrin exposure affects evoked DA release or uptake in PFF-injected animals 4 months after PFF injection ( Figs. 4A–D ). There was a significant increase in both peak DA concentration and upward velocity, a measure of DA release, in the dieldrin/PFF group compared to the vehicle/PFF group ( p =  .0394 and  p =  .0434, respectively) ( Figs. 4E and 4F ). However, there was no significant difference in DAT uptake as measure by tau or downward velocity, which are measures of DAT K m  and V max  ( p =  .6435 and .5303, respectively) ( Figs. 4G and 4H ). Calculated values are shown in  Table 2 . We verified that there was no difference in any metric on the contralateral side to confirm that dieldrin alone had no effect on DA release or uptake ( Supplementary Figs. 1A–D ). We also compared ipsilateral to contralateral metrics in the vehicle/PFF group to and observed no significant effect of PFFs alone ( Supplementary Figs 1E and 1H ). Monomer injected animals in both the vehicle and dieldrin exposed groups showed similar outcomes on all FSCV metrics.\n\nDieldrin/PFFs increase peak dopamine and upward velocity in striatal tissues measured using FSCV. Four months post-PFF injection, animals were killed and FSCV was performed in dorsal striatum. A, Example dopamine versus time graph showing each quantified metric.

Somewhat surprisingly, there was no difference in VMAT2-mediated uptake velocity between the vehicle/PFF and the dieldrin/PFF groups ipsilateral to injection site ( Figure 5 ). As expected, there was no difference in uptake contralateral to the injection site, showing that dieldrin alone had no effect on uptake velocity ( Supplementary Figure 2A ). In addition, uptake was equivalent between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides within the vehicle/PFF group, demonstrating no significant effect of PFFs alone ( Supplementary Figure 2B ). Observed uptake velocity was consistent with previously published values for VMAT2 uptake velocity in WT C57BL/6 mice ( Lohr  et al. , 2014 ). Vehicle and dieldrin exposed animals injected with monomer showed similar VMAT2 uptake velocity in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the injection (vehicle/monomer: 7.020 ± 2.224 pmol/mg/min,  n  = 4; dieldrin/monomer: 5.460 ± 1.678 pmol/mg/min,  n  = 4).\n\nDieldrin does not affect VMAT2 uptake velocity in PFF-injected male F1 offspring. There was no difference in uptake velocity ipsilateral to injection site 4 months post-PFF injection ( p  = .4524). All data shown as mean ± SD.\n\n## Discussion\n\nBased on the results reported here, we expand our model for how developmental dieldrin exposure leads to increased susceptibility to synucleinopathy-induced deficits in motor behavior ( Figures 6  and  7 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). In this model, exposure to dieldrin occurs during prenatal and postnatal development. The half-life of dieldrin in mouse brain is less than a week, so no detectable dieldrin remains in the brain of F1 offspring by a few weeks after weaning ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  World Health Organization & International Programme on Chemical Safety, 1989 ). When dieldrin is present in the developing brain, it is thought to act on developing DA neurons by inhibiting GABA A  receptor-mediated chloride flux, resulting in increased neuronal activity ( Lauder  et al. , 1998 ;  Liu  et al. , 1997 ;  Narahashi, 1996 ;  Narahashi  et al. , 1995 ;  Okada  et al. , 2004 ;  Paladini and Tepper, 1999 ). Based on previous results, we propose that this net increase in neuronal activity modifies the dopamine system through persistent sex-specific changes in epigenetic mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of genes important for dopamine neuron development and maintenance in the substantia nigra and for the neuroinflammatory system in the striatum ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). These changes alter the response of the nigrostriatal system to future insults via persistent alterations in striatal dopamine synapses that manifest as an early increase in compensatory mechanisms triggered by synucleinopathy-induced striatal DA loss in adult male mice ( Figure 6 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nOverview of developmental dieldrin/PFF 2-hit model.\n\nSummary of observed changes in the dieldrin PFF 2-hit model. Timelines show representative changes synuclein pathology, microglial activation, striatal loss, and nigral degeneration in the PFF model based on published literature, shown as the percent change in these markers compared to a saline/monomer injected mouse. Grey boxes indicate previous results from our lab in the dieldrin PFF 2-hit model. White boxes indicate FSCV and uptake results reported here at 4 months post-PFF injection. Light grey and dark grey squares represent results from vehicle: PFF and dieldrin: PFF animals, respectively.\n\nOur results are also consistent with the idea of silent neurotoxicity, where the effects of early life exposures are unmasked by challenges later in life, the cumulative effects of exposures over the lifespan, or the effects of aging ( Cory-Slechta  et al. , 2005 ;  Kraft  et al. , 2016 ). In such a paradigm, developmental exposure to dieldrin primes the nigrostriatal striatal system in male offspring to have an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy induced by α-syn PFFs in the absence of observable changes in typical markers of nigrostriatal dysfunction and degeneration. In support of this, our previous studies identified persistent epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in genes related to DAergic differentiation and maintenance in the midbrain and altered expression of neuroinflammatory genes in the striatum at 12 weeks of age following developmental dieldrin exposure ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). In a parallel study, we are also tracking the longitudinal patterns of dieldrin-induced epigenetic changes across the timeline of this entire 2-hit model from birth to 9 months of age to determine if dieldrin alters the trajectory of epigenetic changes across the lifespan.\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that exploring dieldrin-induced changes that produce this high susceptibility state are critical to advancing our understanding of how exposures contribute to increased risk of PD and underscore the need to study PD-related exposures across the lifespan, particularly during sensitive periods of neurodevelopment.\n\nHere, we demonstrate that developmental dieldrin exposure alters response to synucleinopathy and enhances DA release in PFF-injected male animals 4 months after PFF-injection ( Figure 4 ). These results are consistent with our previous observation of an exacerbated increasein DA turnover at 6 months, summarized in 7 ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). If more DA is released at this 4 months, but DAT and VMAT2 uptake velocities are unchanged, this could lead to the increased DA turnover observed at 6 month post-PFF injection ( Alter  et al. , 2013 ). Importantly, our current data were collected 4 months post-PFF injection while our previous data showed increase striatal DA turnover at 6 months, suggesting that this enhanced DA release precedes effects on DA turnover and motor behavior ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). Of note, in our previous study, we reported that pSyn aggregation at 1 and 2 months, the loss of total striatal DA and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, at 2 and 6 months post-PFF injection and loss of nigral DA neurons at 6 months were not affected by dieldrin exposure ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ) ( Figure 7 ). Taken together, despite similar levels of synucleinopathy-induced pathology and total tissue DA levels in dieldrin and vehicle exposed animals, dieldrin exposed animals display an increase in evoked DA release at 4 months post-PFF injection.\n\nWhile FSCV has been utilized in α-syn knockout and α-syn overexpressing models, to our knowledge, this is the first study to perform FSCV in either the dieldrin or α-syn PFF mouse model with intrastriatal injection ( Somayaji  et al. , 2020 ;  Threlfell  et al. , 2021 ;  Yavich  et al. , 2004 ). A previous paper performed FSCV in the mouse α-syn PFF model via intranigral injections at 2- and 5 months of age and reported decreased DA release in older animals only at 1- and 2 months post-injection (Sun  et al. , 2021). These and other studies in different α-syn models indicate a critical role for a-syn in DA release, synaptic vesicle fusion, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of synaptic vesicle pool size ( Abeliovich  et al. , 2000 ;  Bellani  et al. , 2010 ;  Cheng  et al. , 2011 ;  Dagra  et al. , 2021 ;  Ingelsson, 2016 ;  Murphy  et al. , 2000 ;  Volles  et al. , 2001 ;  Xilouri  et al. , 2013 ). Given that we did not observe any effect of dieldrin or PFF alone on DA release, dieldrin exposure appears to cause changes in the synaptic terminal that prime the nigrostriatal system for an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy and striatal DA loss, resulting in early enhanced DA release and an eventual increase DA turnover ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). Early nigrostriatal compensatory changes are well-documented in human PD, multiple animal models of DA deficits, and more recently in a model of other monoaminergic (norepinephrine) loss ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1994 ,  1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1998 ,  1989 ). Together, this suggests that dieldrin induces changes in the synaptic terminal that increase the compensatory response to early synucleinopathy-induced striatal DA loss that contributes to greater long-term increases in DA turnover due to increases in cytosolic DA, the resulting oxidative stress, and acceleration of the toxic interplay between dysregulated α-syn and DA ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1989 ,  1998 ). Such a relationship between DA and α-syn is well-established and interfering with either can lead to a cycle of neurotoxicity where DA and α-syn interact and exacerbate the toxic effects of one another ( Nemani  et al. , 2010 ;  Roy, 2017 ;  Peng  et al. , 2005 ;  Perez  et al. , 2002 ;  Tehranian  et al. , 2006 ;  Venda  et al. , 2010 ;  Yavich  et al. , 2004 ).\n\nWe expected to see a relative increase in DAT function compared to VMAT2 function 4 months after PFF injection that was greater in animals developmentally exposed to dieldrin that would lead to increased cytosolic DA and DA turnover and explain the dieldrin-induced exacerbation of synucleinopathy-induced changes in DA turnover ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). However, we did not observe any dieldrin related effect on VMAT2 uptake in PFF-injected animals ( Figure 5 ). It is possible that there is an effect on VMAT2 uptake velocity in the intact system that was not observed here due to methodology. Specifically, isolating synaptic vesicles for this assay removes them from their biological context and measures persistent changes in function ( Caudle  et al. , 2007 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ,  2015 ,  2016 ). In addition, this assay involves homogenizing the entire hemisphere of the brain, so effects may be diluted by DAergic vesicles from areas of the brain not affected in our PFF model, including unaffected terminals within the striatum. Thus, this assay may not have the sensitivity to detect a small change in this small subpopulation of terminals. Unfortunately, technical limitations preclude us from performing this assay on unilateral striata from mouse brain.\n\nIt is also possible to increase the relative levels of DAT to VMAT2 function by affecting DAT function without alerting VMAT2 function. Multiple prior studies show that both dieldrin and PFFs can impact DAT expression and function ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  Sossi  et al. , 2022 ). Specifically, developmental dieldrin exposure was previously reported to lead to increases in striatal DAT levels at 12 weeks of age and changes in the DAT/VMAT2 ratio, but we did not observe the same effect in our previous study ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). In the mouse PFF model, striatal DAT protein expression at 6 months post-PFF injection in C57BL/6 mice was observed, but not at 1- and 3 months ( Luk  et al. , 2012a ). Thus, it is possible that dieldrin-induced increases in striatal DAT function lead to a less severe loss of DAT following PFF-induced synucleinopathy and a relative increase of DAT to VMAT2 function. However, we observed no change in DAT uptake in this study as measured by Tau and downward velocity, measures of DAT K m  and V max , from FSCV data ( Figure 4 ). Thus, it is possible that if more DA is released, but neither DAT- nor VMAT2-mediated uptake velocity is changed, the observed increase in turnover is due to both intracellular breakdown and extracellular metabolism of DA. Despite these caveats regarding VMAT2 and DAT uptake, this new data is consistent with our previous results in this 2-hit model showing no increase in α-syn pathology but an enhanced response to synucleinopathy in dieldrin exposed F1 male offspring ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nContrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe a synucleinopathy-induced decrease in DA release despite approximately 45% loss of total striatal DA levels 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ). This discrepancy is likely due to methodological differences and the underlying biology of DA neurons. HPLC measures total tissue DA levels from tissue punches, while FSCV measures extracellular DA only from the area immediately surrounding the electrode. Biologically, while there is a significant loss of total tissue DA at 2 months post-PFF injection, reductions in DA release at these synapses may be delayed relative to this loss. Most striatal DA synapses are silent, and the majority of synaptic vesicles are located within the reserve pool rather than the readily releasable pool ( Goldstein, 2012 ,  2013 ,  2021 ;  Sulzer  et al. , 2016 ;  Trudeau  et al. , 2014 ). Additionally, within the striatum of PFF-injected animals, we expect only a third to a half of terminals to be affected. Together, this leaves a pool of both surviving neurons and vesicles within affected neurons to maintain DA release. Consistent with this, we previously observed only mild PFF-associated effects on motor behavior at 4 months post-PFF injection, suggesting that DA release is maintained even with 45% loss of total striatal DA at 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). In line with this, it is generally accepted that DA-related symptoms in human PD do not present until at least 30% of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway are lost, suggesting that remaining neurons release sufficient quantities of DA despite loss of total DA ( Cheng  et al. , 2010 ).\n\n## \n\nBased on the results reported here, we expand our model for how developmental dieldrin exposure leads to increased susceptibility to synucleinopathy-induced deficits in motor behavior ( Figures 6  and  7 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). In this model, exposure to dieldrin occurs during prenatal and postnatal development. The half-life of dieldrin in mouse brain is less than a week, so no detectable dieldrin remains in the brain of F1 offspring by a few weeks after weaning ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  World Health Organization & International Programme on Chemical Safety, 1989 ).

Early nigrostriatal compensatory changes are well-documented in human PD, multiple animal models of DA deficits, and more recently in a model of other monoaminergic (norepinephrine) loss ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1994 ,  1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1998 ,  1989 ).

Additionally, within the striatum of PFF-injected animals, we expect only a third to a half of terminals to be affected. Together, this leaves a pool of both surviving neurons and vesicles within affected neurons to maintain DA release. Consistent with this, we previously observed only mild PFF-associated effects on motor behavior at 4 months post-PFF injection, suggesting that DA release is maintained even with 45% loss of total striatal DA at 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). In line with this, it is generally accepted that DA-related symptoms in human PD do not present until at least 30% of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway are lost, suggesting that remaining neurons release sufficient quantities of DA despite loss of total DA ( Cheng  et al. , 2010 ).\n\n## A model of environmental risk and silent neurotoxicity in PD\n\nBased on the results reported here, we expand our model for how developmental dieldrin exposure leads to increased susceptibility to synucleinopathy-induced deficits in motor behavior ( Figures 6  and  7 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). In this model, exposure to dieldrin occurs during prenatal and postnatal development. The half-life of dieldrin in mouse brain is less than a week, so no detectable dieldrin remains in the brain of F1 offspring by a few weeks after weaning ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  World Health Organization & International Programme on Chemical Safety, 1989 ). When dieldrin is present in the developing brain, it is thought to act on developing DA neurons by inhibiting GABA A  receptor-mediated chloride flux, resulting in increased neuronal activity ( Lauder  et al. , 1998 ;  Liu  et al. , 1997 ;  Narahashi, 1996 ;  Narahashi  et al. , 1995 ;  Okada  et al. , 2004 ;  Paladini and Tepper, 1999 ). Based on previous results, we propose that this net increase in neuronal activity modifies the dopamine system through persistent sex-specific changes in epigenetic mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of genes important for dopamine neuron development and maintenance in the substantia nigra and for the neuroinflammatory system in the striatum ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). These changes alter the response of the nigrostriatal system to future insults via persistent alterations in striatal dopamine synapses that manifest as an early increase in compensatory mechanisms triggered by synucleinopathy-induced striatal DA loss in adult male mice ( Figure 6 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\nOverview of developmental dieldrin/PFF 2-hit model.\n\nSummary of observed changes in the dieldrin PFF 2-hit model. Timelines show representative changes synuclein pathology, microglial activation, striatal loss, and nigral degeneration in the PFF model based on published literature, shown as the percent change in these markers compared to a saline/monomer injected mouse. Grey boxes indicate previous results from our lab in the dieldrin PFF 2-hit model. White boxes indicate FSCV and uptake results reported here at 4 months post-PFF injection. Light grey and dark grey squares represent results from vehicle: PFF and dieldrin: PFF animals, respectively.\n\nOur results are also consistent with the idea of silent neurotoxicity, where the effects of early life exposures are unmasked by challenges later in life, the cumulative effects of exposures over the lifespan, or the effects of aging ( Cory-Slechta  et al. , 2005 ;  Kraft  et al. , 2016 ). In such a paradigm, developmental exposure to dieldrin primes the nigrostriatal striatal system in male offspring to have an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy induced by α-syn PFFs in the absence of observable changes in typical markers of nigrostriatal dysfunction and degeneration. In support of this, our previous studies identified persistent epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in genes related to DAergic differentiation and maintenance in the midbrain and altered expression of neuroinflammatory genes in the striatum at 12 weeks of age following developmental dieldrin exposure ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). In a parallel study, we are also tracking the longitudinal patterns of dieldrin-induced epigenetic changes across the timeline of this entire 2-hit model from birth to 9 months of age to determine if dieldrin alters the trajectory of epigenetic changes across the lifespan.\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that exploring dieldrin-induced changes that produce this high susceptibility state are critical to advancing our understanding of how exposures contribute to increased risk of PD and underscore the need to study PD-related exposures across the lifespan, particularly during sensitive periods of neurodevelopment.\n\n## Developmental dieldrin exposure alters the dopaminergic response to synucleinopathy-triggered dopamine deficits\n\nHere, we demonstrate that developmental dieldrin exposure alters response to synucleinopathy and enhances DA release in PFF-injected male animals 4 months after PFF-injection ( Figure 4 ). These results are consistent with our previous observation of an exacerbated increasein DA turnover at 6 months, summarized in 7 ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). If more DA is released at this 4 months, but DAT and VMAT2 uptake velocities are unchanged, this could lead to the increased DA turnover observed at 6 month post-PFF injection ( Alter  et al. , 2013 ). Importantly, our current data were collected 4 months post-PFF injection while our previous data showed increase striatal DA turnover at 6 months, suggesting that this enhanced DA release precedes effects on DA turnover and motor behavior ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). Of note, in our previous study, we reported that pSyn aggregation at 1 and 2 months, the loss of total striatal DA and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, at 2 and 6 months post-PFF injection and loss of nigral DA neurons at 6 months were not affected by dieldrin exposure ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ) ( Figure 7 ). Taken together, despite similar levels of synucleinopathy-induced pathology and total tissue DA levels in dieldrin and vehicle exposed animals, dieldrin exposed animals display an increase in evoked DA release at 4 months post-PFF injection.\n\nWhile FSCV has been utilized in α-syn knockout and α-syn overexpressing models, to our knowledge, this is the first study to perform FSCV in either the dieldrin or α-syn PFF mouse model with intrastriatal injection ( Somayaji  et al. , 2020 ;  Threlfell  et al. , 2021 ;  Yavich  et al. , 2004 ). A previous paper performed FSCV in the mouse α-syn PFF model via intranigral injections at 2- and 5 months of age and reported decreased DA release in older animals only at 1- and 2 months post-injection (Sun  et al. , 2021). These and other studies in different α-syn models indicate a critical role for a-syn in DA release, synaptic vesicle fusion, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of synaptic vesicle pool size ( Abeliovich  et al. , 2000 ;  Bellani  et al. , 2010 ;  Cheng  et al. , 2011 ;  Dagra  et al. , 2021 ;  Ingelsson, 2016 ;  Murphy  et al. , 2000 ;  Volles  et al. , 2001 ;  Xilouri  et al. , 2013 ). Given that we did not observe any effect of dieldrin or PFF alone on DA release, dieldrin exposure appears to cause changes in the synaptic terminal that prime the nigrostriatal system for an exacerbated response to synucleinopathy and striatal DA loss, resulting in early enhanced DA release and an eventual increase DA turnover ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Kochmanski  et al. , 2019 ). Early nigrostriatal compensatory changes are well-documented in human PD, multiple animal models of DA deficits, and more recently in a model of other monoaminergic (norepinephrine) loss ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1994 ,  1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1998 ,  1989 ). Together, this suggests that dieldrin induces changes in the synaptic terminal that increase the compensatory response to early synucleinopathy-induced striatal DA loss that contributes to greater long-term increases in DA turnover due to increases in cytosolic DA, the resulting oxidative stress, and acceleration of the toxic interplay between dysregulated α-syn and DA ( Bezard and Gross, 1998 ;  Iannitelli  et al. , 2023 ;  Molina-Mateo  et al. , 2017 ;  Onn  et al. , 1986 ;  Snyder  et al. , 1990 ;  Zhang  et al. , 1988 ;  Zigmond, 1997 ;  Zigmond  et al. , 1984 ,  1989 ,  1998 ). Such a relationship between DA and α-syn is well-established and interfering with either can lead to a cycle of neurotoxicity where DA and α-syn interact and exacerbate the toxic effects of one another ( Nemani  et al. , 2010 ;  Roy, 2017 ;  Peng  et al. , 2005 ;  Perez  et al. , 2002 ;  Tehranian  et al. , 2006 ;  Venda  et al. , 2010 ;  Yavich  et al. , 2004 ).\n\n## Developmental dieldrin exposure does not affect DAT- or VMAT2-mediated uptake in PFF-injected animals\n\nWe expected to see a relative increase in DAT function compared to VMAT2 function 4 months after PFF injection that was greater in animals developmentally exposed to dieldrin that would lead to increased cytosolic DA and DA turnover and explain the dieldrin-induced exacerbation of synucleinopathy-induced changes in DA turnover ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). However, we did not observe any dieldrin related effect on VMAT2 uptake in PFF-injected animals ( Figure 5 ). It is possible that there is an effect on VMAT2 uptake velocity in the intact system that was not observed here due to methodology. Specifically, isolating synaptic vesicles for this assay removes them from their biological context and measures persistent changes in function ( Caudle  et al. , 2007 ;  Lohr  et al. , 2014 ,  2015 ,  2016 ). In addition, this assay involves homogenizing the entire hemisphere of the brain, so effects may be diluted by DAergic vesicles from areas of the brain not affected in our PFF model, including unaffected terminals within the striatum. Thus, this assay may not have the sensitivity to detect a small change in this small subpopulation of terminals. Unfortunately, technical limitations preclude us from performing this assay on unilateral striata from mouse brain.\n\nIt is also possible to increase the relative levels of DAT to VMAT2 function by affecting DAT function without alerting VMAT2 function. Multiple prior studies show that both dieldrin and PFFs can impact DAT expression and function ( Hatcher  et al. , 2007 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ;  Sossi  et al. , 2022 ). Specifically, developmental dieldrin exposure was previously reported to lead to increases in striatal DAT levels at 12 weeks of age and changes in the DAT/VMAT2 ratio, but we did not observe the same effect in our previous study ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Richardson  et al. , 2006 ). In the mouse PFF model, striatal DAT protein expression at 6 months post-PFF injection in C57BL/6 mice was observed, but not at 1- and 3 months ( Luk  et al. , 2012a ). Thus, it is possible that dieldrin-induced increases in striatal DAT function lead to a less severe loss of DAT following PFF-induced synucleinopathy and a relative increase of DAT to VMAT2 function. However, we observed no change in DAT uptake in this study as measured by Tau and downward velocity, measures of DAT K m  and V max , from FSCV data ( Figure 4 ). Thus, it is possible that if more DA is released, but neither DAT- nor VMAT2-mediated uptake velocity is changed, the observed increase in turnover is due to both intracellular breakdown and extracellular metabolism of DA. Despite these caveats regarding VMAT2 and DAT uptake, this new data is consistent with our previous results in this 2-hit model showing no increase in α-syn pathology but an enhanced response to synucleinopathy in dieldrin exposed F1 male offspring ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ).\n\n## Synucleinopathy alone does not affect DA release 4 months after PFF injection\n\nContrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe a synucleinopathy-induced decrease in DA release despite approximately 45% loss of total striatal DA levels 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ;  Luk  et al. , 2012a ). This discrepancy is likely due to methodological differences and the underlying biology of DA neurons. HPLC measures total tissue DA levels from tissue punches, while FSCV measures extracellular DA only from the area immediately surrounding the electrode. Biologically, while there is a significant loss of total tissue DA at 2 months post-PFF injection, reductions in DA release at these synapses may be delayed relative to this loss. Most striatal DA synapses are silent, and the majority of synaptic vesicles are located within the reserve pool rather than the readily releasable pool ( Goldstein, 2012 ,  2013 ,  2021 ;  Sulzer  et al. , 2016 ;  Trudeau  et al. , 2014 ). Additionally, within the striatum of PFF-injected animals, we expect only a third to a half of terminals to be affected. Together, this leaves a pool of both surviving neurons and vesicles within affected neurons to maintain DA release. Consistent with this, we previously observed only mild PFF-associated effects on motor behavior at 4 months post-PFF injection, suggesting that DA release is maintained even with 45% loss of total striatal DA at 2 months post-PFF ( Gezer  et al. , 2020 ). In line with this, it is generally accepted that DA-related symptoms in human PD do not present until at least 30% of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway are lost, suggesting that remaining neurons release sufficient quantities of DA despite loss of total DA ( Cheng  et al. , 2010 ).\n\n## Supplementary data\n\nSupplementary data  are available at  Toxicological Sciences  online.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nClick here for additional data file.",
