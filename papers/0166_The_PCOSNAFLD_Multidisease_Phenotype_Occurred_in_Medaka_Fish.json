      "text": "Since the middle of the\n20th century, there has been substantial\ngrowth in the development and production of industrial chemicals.\nBPA is one of the most widely manufactured chemicals and an environmental\ncontaminant worldwide. BPA can induce epigenetic alteration in germline\nstem cells and gametes. 1 − 3  Aside from causing adverse reproductive and nonreproductive\nhealth outcomes in the directly exposed generations, BPA can also\ncontribute to transgenerational health outcomes in several subsequent\ngenerations. 4 , 5  Various BPA-induced transgenerational\nhealth effects have been reported in animal models, such as diminished\nfertilization rate 6 , 7  and osmoregulatory gene expression, 8  cardiac disorders, 9 , 10  social recognition\nand behavioral variations, 11  and reproductive\nand metabolic diseases. 5 , 12  Because of its widespread health\neffects, BPA has been banned in North America and the European Union\nin certain consumer goods. 13 − 15  Although BPA is currently banned,\nthe current ban may not completely protect future generations’\nreproductive and metabolic health because ancestral BPA exposure-induced\nepigenetic changes in germ cells can be passed on to somatic cells\nof future generations, leading to impaired metabolic and reproductive\nhealth. 4 , 5  We have previously demonstrated that ancestral\nBPA exposure could cause transgenerational nonalcoholic fatty liver\ndisease (NAFLD), which can persist for five generations in medaka. 16  In fish, the liver plays an intrinsic role in\nfemale reproduction by providing the major egg yolk precursor protein,\ni.e., vitellogenin, that supports embryo development and larvae by\nsupplementing protein and lipid-rich nutrients.\n\nTypically, ovarian\nfunction depends largely on the hypothalamus–pituitary–ovary\n(HPO) axis activated by GnRH pulsatility followed by releases of pituitary-derived\ngonadotropins such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing\nhormone (LH), and sex steroids (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone)\nsecreted by gonads. 17 , 18  As the most common female reproductive\ndisease, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by an\nimbalance between FSH and LH, inhibited follicle maturation, formation\nof multiple small cysts due to degeneration of follicles, and an increase\nin free testosterone. 19 , 20  Up to 75% of women of reproductive\nage suffer from PCOS due to hormonal imbalance, making it the most\nprevalent endocrine disease among premenopausal women. 21  As an acute endocrine disruptor, BPA dysregulates\nFSH and LH levels followed by abnormal folliculogenesis, 22  hinders embryo implantation, 23  alters estrous cyclicity, 24  and\nupregulates AMH, causing an increase in the number of preovulatory\nfollicles. 25  BPA is presumed to be an epigenetically\ntoxic compound. 26  Aside from causing adverse\nhealth outcomes in the exposed generation, BPA can also contribute\nto transgenerational health outcomes through abnormal epigenetic changes\nin germ cells via germline transmission. 27 , 28  In a previous study, polycystic ovarian syndrome was positively\ncorrelated with metabolic diseases such as NAFLD 29  and deregulation of estrogen signaling, 30 − 32  suggesting\ncross talk between the hepato-ovarian axis. A positive correlation\nhas been found between PCOS and biopsy-confirmed NAFLD 33 − 35  at an intragenerational level; however, whether this relationship\nis heritable at the transgenerational level is not currently understood.\nThe proposed study further investigates this issue by incorporating\nphenotypic and omics approaches.\n\nA multidisease phenotype can\ndevelop in organisms due to direct\nexposure to environmental chemicals; however, the mechanisms underlying\nsuch compounded adverse health outcomes are not clearly understood.\nNeither is it clearly understood whether such phenotypes persist in\norganisms in subsequent generations after the remediation of the environmental\ncontamination. Using a multi-omics (integrated transcriptomics and\nmetabolomics) approach, the present study examined heritable NAFLD–PCOS,\na multidisease phenotype, in medaka fish whose ancestors were exposed\nto BPA during their first 15 days of life and never thereafter. Fish,\nsuch as medaka and zebrafish, serve as biomedical animal models to\nstudy human diseases, including NAFLD and PCOS. 36 − 40  Because of the conserved mechanism for processing\nepigenetic information in post-fertilization stage embryos and primordial\ngerm cells with mice and humans, medaka becomes an ideal animal model\nto study the environmentally induced epigenetic inheritance of transgenerational\ndisease phenotype. 39 , 41"

Adult medaka fish were maintained\nin 20 L glass aquaria on a light–dark cycle of 14:10 h with\na recirculatory water system with an exchange of 25% water every 4\nh at 26 ± 1 °C and fed three times a day with Otohime granular\nfood and newly hatched brine shrimp ( Artemia  nauplii).\nEmbryos were incubated in glass Petri dishes and larvae in 1 L tanks\nuntil they could feed and swim independently. The larvae at above\n25 dpf stage were transferred to 5 gal glass tanks for rearing until\nend point measurement. For this study, 4 month old adult medaka females\nwere used.\n\nBisphenol A exposure\ncan affect metabolic and reproductive health at various concentrations. 43 − 47  The present study is the downstream analytical part of a bigger\ntransgenerational study. The concentration of BPA was selected after\ntesting a dose–response curve, and the concentration of BPA\nselected was 10 μg/L, which is realistic with regard to the\nenvironmental concentration in many regions of the world. 48 , 49  The measured concentration of BPA was within <10% of the calculated\nconcentration throughout the exposure period, and uptake was measured\nto be 20 pg/mg egg/day as previously described. 48 , 49  BPA exposure was initiated 8 h post fertilization stage (hpf) and\ncontinued until day 15 after fertilization (dpf) with a renewal of\nexposure once daily. BPA exposure was designed to include epigenetic\nreprogramming events in germ cells and to avoid epigenetic reprogramming\nof embryos that takes place between fertilization and blastula stages\n(8 hpf). After the BPA exposure was complete, the F0 generation (exposed\nindividuals) and subsequent generations (offspring) were raised in\nclean water without exposure to BPA. The exposure window thus included\na critical developmental window for sex determination and liver differentiation. 50  The use of initial BPA exposure (10 μg/L)\nat F0 generation was previously reported to cause NAFLD, fertilization\ndefects, and increased embryo mortality in subsequent unexposed generations\nof medaka. 8 , 16 , 48\n\nGeneration of the BPA-exposed transgenerational\nlines of medaka was previously described. 51  Briefly, following BPA exposure for 15 days, larvae were raised\nin clean water until they became adults, designated as F0 adults (intragenerational\ndue to direct exposure to BPA). At 120 days postfertilization, all\nexperimental medaka reached sexual maturity and spawned. 52  A total of six pairs of fish from the F0 generation\nwere bred at 120 days postfertilization to produce F1 (intergenerational).\nThe same mating methodology was used to produce subsequent generations\nup to F4 (the fifth generation, transgenerational).\n\nThe fish from BPA-exposed and control lineages\nwere bred in glass tanks at a ratio of three females and two males\nfor 7 days. Each morning, eggs laid by females were collected and\nexamined under a microscope to determine fecundity and fertilization\nstatus. Fecundity was calculated as the average number of eggs laid\nper female per day. Eggs were examined under a stereoscope to confirm\nfertilization according to the methods previously described. 53  A two-tailed  t  test was performed\nbetween the F4 generation of BPA lineage and the control group to\ndetermine statistical significance.\n\nTo examine\nwhether the BPA lineage fish develop PCOS-like syndrome in adulthood\n(120 dpf), 15 females from each group (BPA lineage and control lineage)\nwere euthanized with MS-222 (250 mg/L). The ovary and liver of both\ngroups were dissected, weighed, and divided into two halves. For RNA/DNA\nextraction, half of the ovary and liver were fixed in RNA/DNA shield\nsolution (Zymo Research, CA) and the other half in Bouin’s\nsolution for histopathological analysis. Hepatosomatic index (HSI),\ngonadosomatic index (GSI), and body mass index (BMI) were calculated\nas liver weight (g) × 100/body weight (g), ovary weight (g) ×\n100/body weight (g), 54  and [body weight\n(g) – ovary weight (g)]/body length (cm 2 ), respectively.\nVisceral fat was collected to quantify adipose tissue (see  Supporting Information ). For histological examination,\nsamples were embedded in low-temperature paraffin, sectioned at 5\nμm thickness in a microtome, and stained with hematoxylin following\noptimized histological protocol. 16  To determine\nfat accumulation, liver samples from the control and BPA lineages\nwere fixed in the Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound, sectioned\nin a cryotome at 15 μm thickness, and used for Oil Red O staining.\n\nOn the basis of\nfollicular development, the ovary of the medaka was categorized into\nfive developmental stages according to the literature previously published. 55  Stage I contained primary follicles with intense\nbasophilic cytoplasm with a peripherally located nucleus. Stage II\ncontained cortical alveolar stage oocytes. Stage III contained yolk\nin vitellogenic oocytes with conspicuous zona radiata. Stage IV contained\nabundant yolk granules in late vitellogenic oocytes with peripheral\nmigration of the germinal vesicle. Stage V contained mature stage\noocytes without germinal vesicles, according to the published literature. 56  Developmental stages of the ovary were measured\nin both groups (BPA lineage and control), and the two-way analysis\nof variance was used to evaluate the significance of differences in\ndifferent stages of folliculogenesis.\n\nHyperplasia of granulosa\ncells; thinning, invasion, and breakdown of the zona radiata; disintegration\nof the basal membrane; and absorption of vitellus are the characteristics\nof atretic follicles. 57  The ImageJ software\nwas used to measure the follicular area. The atretic follicles from\ncontrol and BPA-lineage fish were analyzed by measuring the follicular\narea using the ImageJ software. The reference value was taken from\nthe mean area of the atretic follicles (1p 2 ) in the control\novaries. Atretic follicles with a diameter greater than 1p 2  were considered as big atretic follicles. Blind tests were conducted\nby two different lab members to characterize different stages of folliculogenesis\nand atretic follicles. The results were consistent among all testers.\n\nThe ovaries of control and BPA lineage female\nfish (15 individuals from each lineage) were used for total RNA extraction\nby using a Quick RNA/DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (#D-7003, Zymo Research,\nCA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol as previously\ndescribed. 58  RNA quality was tested by\nbleach gel electrophoresis, 59  and the quantity\nwas determined by Nanodrop 2000 and Qubit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,\nMA). The RNA of the ovary from three females was pooled as one biological\nreplicate per group. Transcriptome libraries were prepared using a\nNEBNext Ultra II RNA Kit and the manufacturer’s protocol. The\nlibraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X (Novogene Corporation,\nCA, USA) using a 150 bp paired-end sequencing strategy (short reads),\nproducing 20–40 million reads per biological replicate.\n\nThe reads were first preprocessed with fastp 0.23.2, 60  an ultrafast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor, which performs\nquality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality\npruning, and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ\ndata. The processed reads were then mapped to the medaka genome (Oryzias_latipes.ASM223467v1)\nusing STAR 2.7.7a. 61  Finally, DESeq2 v1.34.0\nwas used to do the differential expression analysis. 62  GSEA analysis was done using the GSEA Preranked tool (GSEA\nv4.1). 63 , 64  For GSEA analysis, only genes showing twofold\nup- or downregulation were considered. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments\nwere obtained using “C5: ontology gene sets” of the\nMSigDB collection. 65\n\nA predefined\nset of PCOS specific DEGs was obtained from public human patient data\nsets: GSE34526125, GSE10946126, and ArrayExpress accession number\nE-MEXP-3641127. 66 − 68  The DEGs (FDR 0.05 and Log2FC > 0.5) from the\nmedaka\novary RNA-seq were compared with the PCOS patient data set. 66  Overlapping DEGs between BPA lineage and PCOS\npatient group were selected and illustrated by using VENNY ( http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html ). The PCOS-specific DEGs represented in the ovary of the BPA lineage\ngroup were used, and predicted pathways were constructed using ShinyGO\n0.76.3. 69\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from\nthe ovary and liver of the F4 generation fish using a Quick RNA/DNA\nMiniprep Plus Kit (#D-7003, Zymo Research, CA, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer’s protocol involving  Dnase I  treatment\nof RNA as previously described. 58  The RNA\nwas reconstituted in 20 μL of nuclease-free water (Zymo Research,\nCA, USA) followed by testing RNA integrity by bleach gel electrophoresis 59  and quantified by Qubit and Nanodrop 2000 (A260/280\nbetween 1.8 and 2). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA\nwas performed on each sample using a high-capacity reverse transcription\nkit (Applied Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions\nas previously described. 53 , 70  RT-qPCR was performed\nin a QuantStudio 3 Real-time PCR equipment (Applied Biosystems) using\ngene-specific primers ( Table S1 ) and the\n2 –ΔΔCt  method. The  rpl7  gene was selected as a stable housekeeping gene after testing the\nexpression pattern of several housekeeping genes. Primers were designed\nusing Primer3web 71  from exon–exon\njunctions to avoid genomic DNA amplification ( Table S1 ).\n\nCanonical pathways were determined by using the IPA software (V01-07;\nQiagen), and molecular and cellular function were determined using\nthe specific Ingenuity Knowledge Database (using default parameters\nfor all tissues and cell lines, with relaxed filters), which provides\na repository of biological interactions and functional annotations.\nDysregulated genes (FDR 0.05 and Log2FC > 0.5) in the ovary of\nF4\ngeneration fish were converted to the corresponding human orthologous\nusing the g-profiler website. 72  Fisher’s\nexact test was applied to calculate the significance of each network.\n\nThe ovaries\nof F4 females from control and BPA lineage were pooled respectively\nand used to extract ovarian metabolites. According to a published\nprotocol, 73  ovary samples (20 mg) were\nhomogenized in an ultrasonically extracted solution consisting of\nmethanol/acetonitrile/water (2:2:1, v/v), vortex mixed, and ultrasonically\nextracted twice at a low temperature for 30 min. After incubation\nat −20 °C for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000\nrpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was lyophilized and stored\nat −80 °C. Before use, the lyophilized sample was dissolved\nin acetonitrile water (1:1, v/v), vortex-mixed, and centrifuged at\n14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was injected into the HPLC–MS/MS\nsystem for metabolomic analysis. To ensure the system’s stability,\neight quality control (QC) samples, including whole adductor muscle\ntissues, were inserted throughout the experiment. Mass spectrometry\nwas performed on a Q Exactive plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,\nMA, USA) equipped with electrospray ionization. The mass spectrometry\noperational protocol was previously published. 74  Both negative and positive ion modes were applied with\na capillary voltage setting of ±5.5 kV during instrument operations.\nThe product ion scan  m / z  range was\n25–1200 Da with a scan accumulation time of 0.03 s/spectrum.\nThe collision energy was set to 30 eV.\n\nMass spectrometric\ndata were analyzed, aligned, and filtered with the MZmine 2.2 software\n( http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/ ) using the procedure previously reported elsewhere. 74  Quantile normalization, cube root transformation, and mean\ncentering were used to process the filtered peaks from 4232 peaks\nin the positive mode and 3569 peaks in the negative mode. The resulting\nfeatures were used to explore the total pathway hit by the Mummichog\nalgorithm installed in Metaboanalyst 5.0. 75  Metabolites associated with pathways were further used for PCA to\nreveal intrinsic feature clusters and detect outliers. To examine\nthe relationship between group and spectral data with variance (R2Y)\nand predictive ability (Q2 parameter), a PLS-DA model was used. The\nresonance of metabolites was putatively annotated bioinformatically\nby using the HMDB database 76  ( http://www.hmdb.ca ) and metlin 77  ( http://metlin.scripps.edu ). To visualize the variations of metabolites between the control\nand BPA lineage group, the significantly altered metabolites in the\nBPA lineage compared with the control lineage were identified based\non the following criteria:  P  < 0.05 and fold change\n≥ ±1. VIP > 1 was used for hierarchical clustering\n(Ward\nclustering, Euclidean distance), univariate analysis  t  test, and pathway analysis using Metaboanalyst 5.0 as previously\ndescribed. 78  To determine metabolomic biomarkers\nof PCOS, the classical univariate ROC curve analysis was performed. 79  The area under the curve (AUC) was generally\nbetween 0.5 and 1.0. When AUC > 0.5 and closer to 1, the model\nperforms\nbetter. 80  However, biomarkers were selected\nbased on strict criteria:  P  < 0.05 and AUC = 1\nfrom the ovary of the BPA lineage. BPA lineage ovary metabolites were\ncompared with the PCOS patient metabolite data set. 81  The abundance of amino acids in the BPA lineage ovary was\nplotted in metabolic pathways associated with polycystic ovary syndrome\n(PCOS). 82\n\nThe GraphPad\nPrism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) software was used for statistical\nanalysis and plotting the results. Comparison of data between BPA\nlineage and control lineage, Student’s  t  test,\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post hoc multiple comparison\ntests (Tukey HSD) were used to determine significant differences.\nDifferences with  P  < 0.05 were considered significant\nand have been marked with asterisks (* P  < 0.05;\n** P  < 0.01; *** P  < 0.001)."

However, the GSI ( Figure  1 D) was significantly decreased, suggesting\nthat the F4 fish from the BPA lineage had a reproductive impairment.\n\nAncestral\nBPA exposure caused increased basal metabolic index (BMI),\nvisceral fat accumulation, and hepatosomatic index and reduced gonadosomatic\nindex in BPA lineage females.

(K) Atretic follicle\nwith damaged chorion found in the ovary of BPA lineage (magnification\n×40) and follicular area.\n\nTo determine whether the females had\nreproductive defects, fecundity was measured, which accounts for the\nproduction of eggs per female in the BPA and control lineage. The\nmean total production of eggs per tank (fecundity) and the number\nof fertilized eggs were significantly decreased ( P  < 0.05) in the BPA lineage group compared to the control group\n( Figure 1 E,F). A 40%\ndecrease in ovary size was observed in the BPA lineage fish ( Figure  1 G) compared to the\ncontrol lineage. The number of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic follicles\nwas significantly decreased in the BPA lineage ( Figure  4 A,B) except for stage II ( Figure  1 H). Overall, a 90% decrease\nin the number of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic follicles was observed.\nMorphometric analysis of the follicular stages showed a significantly\nhigher number of stage I oocytes in the ovary of the BPA lineage fish,\nwhich decreased across stages III through stage V ( Figure  1 J). This indicated that follicular\nprogression was disrupted in the BPA lineage fish. Furthermore, the\nBPA lineage group showed damage in the chorion ( Figure  1 J) and an increased mean area of atretic\nfollicles (3.067 ± 0.6190 p 2 ,  Figure  1 J). Additionally, increased numbers of the\natretic follicles, irregular folding of the surface epithelium, degenerated\nfollicles with abnormal tissue deposition ( Figure  1 K), and hyperplasia of the granulosa cells\nwere found in the ovary, indicating a loss of follicular architecture\nin BPA lineage fish.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was able\nto separate 74.5% of biological replicates of both the BPA lineage\nand control lineage group into two clusters ( Figure  2 A), indicating that they are different from\neach other. The expression profiles were consistent across all three\nbiological replicates, indicating that sequencing libraries were of\nexcellent quality. In total, 2546 differentially expressed genes (DEGs),\nincluding 2094 upregulated and 452 downregulated genes, were identified\nin the BPA lineage group ( Figure  2 B), as exhibited in the volcano plot ( Figure  2 C). Global alterations in gene\nexpression in BPA lineage ovary are illustrated in a heatmap ( Figure S1 ). The GO analysis was performed to\nevaluate the functional properties of DEGs. GO results showed the\ntop 20 molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components\n( Figure S2 ). Among all biological processes,\ncellular morphogenesis, differentiation, and protein localization\nwere highly enriched by DEGs from the BPA lineage. Cellular components\nand molecular function had DEGs involved in microtubule organization,\ncellular adhesion, and cellular transport mechanism via the Golgi\napparatus. Additionally, using stricter selection criteria (fold change\n≥ 2,  p -adj ≤ 0.01), the top 10 up-\nand downregulated DEGs (biomarker) were selected from the BPA lineage\ngroup ( Figure  2 D).\nMost upregulated genes were enriched in insulin signaling pathway\n( Figure  2 E,  Figure S3 ), MAPK signaling ( Figure  2 E,  Figure S4 ), AMPK signaling pathway ( Figure  2 E,  Figure S5 ),\nand autophagy pathway ( Figure  2 E). Alternatively, downregulated genes were enriched in Rap1\n( Figure  2 F,  Figure S6 ), cAMP ( Figure  2 F,  Figure S7 ),\nand AGE-RAGE signaling pathway ( Figure  2 F,  Figure S7 ).\n\nGlobal transcriptional\nalterations in the ovary.

Downregulated DEGs were uniquely enriched with the cell signaling\npart of the biological pathway ( Figure S8D ). Additionally, DEGs were enriched with the cell cycle ( Figure S9A ), catabolic process (Figure S9FB),\nplasma membrane component ( Figure S9C ),\nmitochondria metabolic pathway ( Figure S9D ), apoptosis ( Figure S9E ), and p53 pathway\n( Figure S9F ).\n\nExpression patterns of the\ngenes that are associated with ovarian steroidogenic functions, including  amh ,  hsd17b1 ,  cyp19a1 ,  cyp11a1 ,  3 β -HSD ,\nand  cyp17 , were examined. RNA-seq results showed\na significant upregulation of  Cyp11a1 ,  amh ,  hsd17b1 ,  3 β -HSD ,  Cyp19a1  and a significant downregulation of  cyp17  in the BPA lineage group ( Figure  3 A). The expression of  igf1r  and  igfbp3  was downregulated, whereas  igf2b  expression was significantly upregulated, suggesting abnormal insulin\nsignaling in the ovary ( Figure  3 B). The expression of genes encoding collagen proteins, mainly  col1a1b ,  col1a2 , and  col12a1 , was significantly upregulated ( Figure  3 C). This suggests abnormal tissue deposition\nin the ovary of the BPA linage. In the BPA lineage, specific genes\nencoding kinases, including  mapk1 ,  mapk9 ,  mtor ,  pik3r , and  eif2ak3 , and cytokines, including  il17rd ,  il12rb1 , and  fam118b , were significantly upregulated. However,\nthe expressions of  il22ra2 ,  fam219ab , and  edn3  were significantly downregulated ( Figure  3 D,E). Abnormal expression\nof gene-encoding kinase and cytokine indicates molecular pathogenicity.\nThe expressions of genes involved in malignancy such as  myc ,  akt1 ,  apc ,  mtor ,  bcl2l1 ,  daxx , and  jun  were significantly upregulated, and only  smad4  and  src  genes were downregulated in the ovary of the BPA lineage\ngroup ( Figure  3 F).\nAdditionally, essential transcription factors, such as  esr1 ,  foxp3 ,  smad 2 ,  ar , nfkb1, nothch1, klf9, and stat5 involved in the disease pathway\nwere also identified ( Figure  3 G).\n\nAbnormality in the expression of genes encoding (A) steroidogenic\nmetabolism, (B) insulin signaling, (C) collagen synthesis, (D) kinase,\n(E) cytokine, and (F) cancerous genes.

Transcriptional\nalterations in gonadotrophin receptor genes in the ovaries of the\nBPA lineage fish. A significant increase in (H)  lhr  and (I)  3 β -hsd  transcripts\nwas observed in the BPA lineage ovaries. A significant decrease in\n(J)  fshr  and (K)  vtgr  transcript\nlevels was found in the BPA lineage. A significantly abundant transcript\nof (L)  caspase 3  was measured in the BPA lineage\novaries. Asterisk indicates statistical significance at the level\nof * P  < 0.05,  t  test compared\nagainst control lineage.\n\nThe mRNA levels of  lhr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 H) and  3 β -hsd  ( P  < 0.01,  Figure  3 I) were significantly increased in the ovary\nof the BPA lineage. However, mRNAs of  fshr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 J) and  vtgr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 K) were significantly\ndecreased in the ovary of the BPA lineage group. This indicated transgenerational\ndysregulation of steroidogenesis and reproduction-related pathways\nin the BPA lineage fish. Additionally, the levels of  caspase3  mRNAs were significantly increased ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 L) in the ovary of\nthe BPA lineage, suggesting increased apoptosis-mediated cell death\nin the ovary of the BPA lineage fish.\n\nDEGs of BPA lineage\nPCOS fish were compared with publicly available human PCOS patient\nDEGs to identify end-point specific (PCOS) DEGs associated with ancestrally\ninduced PCOS (end point) in the F4 generation. 66  In total, 292 common DEGs were found from the total of\n1374 DEGs found in the human PCOS patient data set ( Figure  4 A). Additionally, 82 DEGs were mutually upregulated in both\nBPA lineage and PCOS patients. Among the total shared DEGs in BPA\nand PCOS patient groups, 37 DEGs were mutually downregulated. However,\n173 shared DEGs showed exclusive expression patterns in the BPA lineage\n( Figure  4 A). From the\ntotal shared DEGs, the top 15 mutually upregulated (Log2FC > 2),\ndownregulated\n(Log2FC < −1), and exclusive BPA-specific DEGs are illustrated\n( Figure  4 B–D).\nHeatmaps show shared common total DEGs between BPA lineage and PCOS\npatients ( Figure S10A–D ). The comparative\nanalysis revealed that the BPA lineage ovaries have similar gene expression\npatterns to human PCOS patients. KEGG pathway analysis on 292 DEGs\nshowed significant enrichment in TNF signaling, IL signaling, growth\nhormone synthesis, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure  4 E). The transcriptome\ndatabase has been submitted to NCBI as  GSE226322  (token # qtqrqoycjtqfxqb).\n\nComparison\nof DEGs found in the PCOS patient data set with those\nin the ovaries of BPA lineage fish.

(D) Top 15 mutual BPA-specific\nDEGs and (E) KEGG pathway enrichment on common DEGs.\n\nTo further understand the biological pathway involved in diseased\nphenotype induced by ancestral BPA exposure, the RNA-seq data were\nannotated into human IDs for core functional analysis using IPA. Canonical\npathways enriched in the molecular mechanism of cancer ( P  value 2.15E-09), autophagy ( P  value 2.95E-08),\nHOTAIR regulatory pathway ( P  value 3.00E-07), cellular\nstress and injury, cell cycle and transcriptional regulation, apoptosis,\ncytokine signaling, and immune response were determined ( Figure  5 A). DEGs were involved\nin the molecular mechanism of cancer ( Figure S11 ), autophagy ( Figure S12 ), and HOTAIR\n( Figure S13 ). Additionally, the gene-disease\nnetwork analysis showed that  akt1  and  tnf  are master regulators of various disease pathways, such as HOTAIR\nregulatory pathways, AMPK signaling, growth failure, and autophagy,\nwhich are all indicative of severe ovarian disease due to ancestral\nBPA exposure ( Figure S14 ). Using the upstream\nregulator analysis (URA) tool, IPA can identify potential upstream\nregulators by analyzing linkage to DEGs via coordinated expression. 83  A total of 94 transcription regulators were\nidentified, and the top 15 transcription regulators were determined\n( Figure S15 ). e sr1  (estrogen\nreceptor1) and  tgfb1  (transforming growth factor\nbeta 1) were the most significant upstream regulators interacting\nwith several genes such as  jun ,  myc ,  foxo3 ,  smad3 , and  e2f1  ( Figure  5 B,C).\n\nIPA analysis\non the DEGs in the BPA lineage ovaries. (A) Canonical\npathway. Upstream regulator gene networks within the DEGs determined\nby IPA. (B) ESR1 and (C) TGFB1 with interactive networks with downstream\ngenes in the development of ovary pathogenesis.\n\nMetabolomic analysis was conducted to address\nthe alterations in ovarian metabolic profiles due to ancestral BPA\nexposure effect in the BPA-exposed control lineage group. An orthogonal\npartial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed\nto elucidate the differences between the BPA and the control lineage\ngroup. According to the score plot, there was a difference among the\ngroups ( Figure S16 ). In this OPLS-DA model,\nR2X = 0.29, R2Y = 0.91, Q2 = 0.5. Metabolites with VIP > 1 are\nshown\nin  Figure S17  with  m / z , retention time, and HMDB class and IDs. The clustered\nheatmap showed the top 50 significant metabolites and their relative\nabundance ( Figure  6 A), providing useful insights into the relationship between unique\nmetabolites of the BPA lineage and control lineage. The metabolites\nbelonged to amino acids, purine and pyrimidine derivatives, organic\nacids, lipid molecules, sugars, and some other class of molecules.\nLipid molecules such as glucosylceramide; PS (16:0/16:0); amino acids\nmainly  l -histidine, allysine,  l -tryptophan, and  l -valine; and purine derivatives mainly guanosine, xanthine,\nhypoxanthine, and guanine were found in higher abundance in BPA lineage\ngroup. 4,6-Dihydroxyquinoline, vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide, uracil, phosphocreatine,\ncytosine, and  l -aspartic acid were detected but in low abundance.\nDifferential abundance of amino acids from the ovary of the BPA lineage\nfish was mapped in metabolic pathways associated with PCOS ( Figure  6 B). Biomarkers of\nPCOS were found in the ovary metabolite data. With  P  < 0.05 and AUC = 1, a total of 17 biomarkers were found in the\novary of the BPA lineage ( Figure  6 C). Those were inosine, guanosine, phosphocreatine,\n2-methylcitric acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene,  l -palmitoylcarnitine, xanthine, niacinamide, asymmetric dimethylarginine,\nall- trans -retinoic acid, hypoxanthine, nicotinic\nacid, ornithine, 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1D-myo-inositol, glucosylceramide,\nand allysine ( Figure S17 ). The top 25 highly\nenriched metabolic pathways were identified. Metabolically important\npathways such as arginine biosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis,\nhistidine metabolism, proline metabolism, and glutathione metabolism\nwere highly enriched in the BPA lineage ovary ( Figure S18 ).\n\nGlobal metabolic alterations in the ovary of BPA lineage\nfish.\n(A) Heatmap showing a differential abundance of the top 50 significant\nmetabolites. (B) The abundance profile of amino acids in the PCOS\nmetabolic pathway. (C) Table of biomarkers and the list of ovarian\nmetabolites.\n\nTo investigate potential metabolites linked to transgenerational\nPCOS, the metabolites of F4 ovary from BPA lineage were compared with\nthe PCOS patient metabolite data. 81  A total\nof 16 metabolites were found to be common between BPA lineage and\nPCOS patients ( Figure  7 A). Among the 16 metabolites, 8 common metabolites showed a mutual\npattern of abundance, and 7 of them showed an exclusive abundance\npattern in the ovary of BPA lineage. Pregnenolone, eicosapentaenoic\nacid, phytosphingosine, azelaic acid, sphinganine, phenylpyruvic acid,\nornithine, and inosine showed similar abundance patterns in the ovary\nof BPA lineage and PCOS patient data set ( Figure  6 A). However, creatinine, taurine, uridine,\nand taurine exhibited an exclusive pattern of abundance under common\nmetabolites ( Figure  6 A). KEGG pathway analysis was conducted on common metabolites found\nin the ovary of BPA lineage and human patients. These pathways included\nsphingolipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine\nand tryptophan metabolism, taurine metabolism, and hypotaurine metabolism\n( Figure S18 ).\n\nComparison of metabolites\nbetween the PCOS patient data set and\nthe ovary of BPA lineage fish. (A) A Venn diagram showing overlapped\nmetabolites in both the PCOS patient data set and the ovary of BPA\nlineage fish. (B) Joint pathway analysis of transcriptome and metabolomes\nwith list of the pathways with total hits,  P  value,\nand FDR.\n\nSignificantly altered metabolites and genes\nwere submitted to joint pathway analysis in Metaboanalyst. 84  Out of the 324 biological processes identified,\n74 pathways had  P  value < 0.05 and FDR < 25%.\nThe top three pathways based on the calculation of  P  value were the ABC transporter, carbon metabolism in cancer, and\narginine biosynthesis ( Figure  7 B). The gene–metabolite interaction network and metabolite–metabolite\ninteraction network are shown in  Figure S19 . Metabolites found in carbon metabolism for triggering cancer were\nmapped in  Figure S20 . The insulin signaling,\nendocytosis, and cancer-related pathways that were found prominent\nin both omics were also significantly enriched in the integrative\nanalysis.\n\nThe liver in the BPA lineage\nfemales had more vacuolated hepatocytes than in the control lineage\nfish ( Figure  8 A). The\nhepatic cells were arranged in sheets separated by sinusoidal meshes.\nTo determine if ancestral BPA exposure caused lipid accumulation in\nthe liver, which is also a symptom of NAFLD, Oil Red O was used to\nstain hepatic neutral lipids. Consistent with their higher hepatosomatic\nindex (HSI), cryosections of the livers of the BPA lineage females\nshowed a proportional accumulation of neutral lipids ( Figure  8 B), indicating the liver of\nBPA lineage developing NAFLD.\n\nAncestral BPA exposure resulted in liver steatosis\nin females of\nthe F4 generation.

Asterisks indicate statistical\nsignificances at the level of * P  < 0.05 and *** P  < 0.001 compared to control lineage by  t  test.\n\nTo examine whether ancestral\nBPA exposure altered the expression of vitellogenic genes in the F4\ngeneration liver, expression profiles of the vitellogenic genes were\ndetermined by qPCR. The mRNA levels of the sex hormone binding globulin\n( shbg ) gene, a PCOS marker, 85  were significantly decreased in the BPA lineage livers ( Figure  8 C). Furthermore,\nthe expression of genes involved in vitellogenin synthesis pathway\nin the liver was significantly altered. Mainly, the expression of\napolipoprotein ba ( apoba ) was significantly downregulated\n( Figure  8 D), and both\nestrogen receptor 1 ( esr1 ) and vitellogenin 3 ( vtg3 ) were significantly upregulated ( Figure  8 E,F) in the BPA lineage."

      "text": "To determine whether the females had\nreproductive defects, fecundity was measured, which accounts for the\nproduction of eggs per female in the BPA and control lineage. The\nmean total production of eggs per tank (fecundity) and the number\nof fertilized eggs were significantly decreased ( P  < 0.05) in the BPA lineage group compared to the control group\n( Figure 1 E,F). A 40%\ndecrease in ovary size was observed in the BPA lineage fish ( Figure  1 G) compared to the\ncontrol lineage. The number of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic follicles\nwas significantly decreased in the BPA lineage ( Figure  4 A,B) except for stage II ( Figure  1 H). Overall, a 90% decrease\nin the number of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic follicles was observed.\nMorphometric analysis of the follicular stages showed a significantly\nhigher number of stage I oocytes in the ovary of the BPA lineage fish,\nwhich decreased across stages III through stage V ( Figure  1 J). This indicated that follicular\nprogression was disrupted in the BPA lineage fish. Furthermore, the\nBPA lineage group showed damage in the chorion ( Figure  1 J) and an increased mean area of atretic\nfollicles (3.067 ± 0.6190 p 2 ,  Figure  1 J). Additionally, increased numbers of the\natretic follicles, irregular folding of the surface epithelium, degenerated\nfollicles with abnormal tissue deposition ( Figure  1 K), and hyperplasia of the granulosa cells\nwere found in the ovary, indicating a loss of follicular architecture\nin BPA lineage fish."

Environmental chemical exposures\nduring germ cell reprogramming can leave chemical-specific epigenetic\nmarks on germ cells, which result in phenotypic abnormalities that\npersist through several generations. 89 − 91  When directly exposed\nto BPA, females develop metabolic disorders or PCOS in the immediate\ngeneration (F0). 92 − 95  However, it is not clearly understood whether future-generation\nfemales can still suffer metabolic and reproductive diseases even\nafter the withdrawal of BPA from consumer products and the environment.\nThis study demonstrates for the first time using medaka fish as an\nanimal model that embryonic exposure to BPA during germ cell reprogramming\nin a grandparental generation leads to multidisease transgenerational\nphenotypes, PCOS, and NAFLD in the fifth generation who did not experience\nBPA exposure. The hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad (HPG)\naxis in fish resembles that in mammals, suggesting a great potential\nto study human PCOS as an alternative nonmammalian model. 36 , 37 , 40  Medaka and zebrafish utilize\nsimilar pathways of sex hormonal regulation of steroidogenesis but\nprocess epigenome in their embryo and germline cells differently. 39  Unlike other fish species, medaka processes\nepigenetic information in postfertilization embryos and primordial\ngerm cells similar to humans and mice, making them excellent transgenerational\nmodels. 38 , 39  This suggests that the mechanistic molecular\ninformation obtained from medaka could be valuable for understanding\nancestral epigenetic effects of BPA in the development of PCOS in\nthe subsequent generation of other higher vertebrates, including humans.\n\nIn the present study, F4 females of the BPA lineage group displayed\nabnormal metabolic traits, such as increased BMI and visceral fat\naccumulation. The ability of BPA to induce fat accumulation has been\ndemonstrated in a direct exposure model. BPA caused insulin resistance\nand disrupted lipid homeostasis in primary human preadipocytes, resulting\nin abnormal fat accumulation  in vitro , 96 − 100  suggesting BPA’s ability to modulate fat deposition due to\nchronic exposure. However, how visceral fat deposition occurs in unexposed\ngenerations due to ancestral exposure is unclear. In addition to transgenerational\nfat deposition in the BPA lineage group, significant upregulation\nof the expression of  il6  and genes encoding several\ncytokines and downregulation of  igf1  were found in\nthe ovary of the BPA lineage, indicating a potential state of insulin\nresistance mediated by visceral fat accumulation. Congruent with a\nprevious study, an altered expression pattern, particularly the upregulation\nof  il6  and activation of  tnf- α,\na master regulator, was found in the ovary of BPA lineage, indicating\nvisceral fat mediation due to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines\n( TNF- α,  IL-6 ) and tissue macrophages,\ncritical drivers of PCOS-obesity multifactorial disease. 101 , 102  The downregulation of  igf1  in the ovary of the\nBPA lineage could also have contributed to impaired follicular growth,\nas reflected histologically. The literature shows decreased levels\nof IGF-I and IGF-II proteins in the follicular fluid of PCOS women\nas well as reduced expression of IGF-1 receptor in human granulosa\ncells, 103 , 104  suggesting the role of IGF protein in PCOS\ndevelopment. The present observations provide an additional line of\ninformation that environmentally induced transgenerational fat deposition\ncould have activated cytokines and decreased follicular maturation\nin females of the BPA lineage, leading to PCOS phenotype.\n\nThe\ngonadotropins play a vital role in PCOS pathogenesis, and in\nthe teleost, they regulate the vitellogenesis and final oocyte maturation/ovulation. 105 , 106  In the present study, lower levels of  fshr  mRNA\nand higher levels of  lhr  mRNA were detected in the\novary of BPA lineage fish than in the control. In teleost, gonadotropin\nreceptor expression positively correlates with plasma hormone levels. 107  The present results indicated lower levels\nof mRNAs for FSH and higher levels of LH in the ovary of BPA lineage\nfish, suggesting transgenerational hormonal imbalance. A high LH/FSH\nratio is a characteristic of PCOS patients. Similar patterns of gonadotropin\nreceptor gene expression suggest a similar trend. 108  Increased levels of plasma FSH and ovarian follicle-stimulating\nhormone receptor ( FSHr ) mRNA levels are required\nfor the transition of oocytes from the previtellogenic stage (stage\nII) to vitellogenic stages (stage III) during ovarian maturation. 106 , 109 , 110  In the present study, abnormal\nfollicular development in stage II (previtellogenic oocyte) was found,\nalong with the downregulation of  fshr  in the ovary\nof BPA lineage. Ovarian follicles are arrested at the primary growth-previtellogenic\ntransition in zebrafish mutant for  fshr. ( 111 ) The restricted maturation of follicles observed\nin the ovary of BPA lineage medaka that leads to anovulation could\nbe due to deficiency of  fshr , which is a primary\nphenotype for PCOS. 112  Consistent with\nour present histopathological findings in medaka, similar histological\nphenotypes were found in the rat model of PCOS, suggesting that the\nBPA lineage group had developed PCOS phenotype in the ovary. 113  Direct exposure to BPA has been linked to follicular\narrest and atresia leading to anovulation, 114 − 116  suggesting that transgenerational PCOS could be driven by mechanisms\nsimilar to those reported from direct exposure studies. The critical\nyet undiscovered information is delineating heritable molecular determinants\nof PCOS and developing strategies to block pathways to disease, as\nenvironmental BPA exposure (past and present) might already have left\nsuch molecular memories in the germline of the existing population.\n\nThe development of PCOS is intrinsically linked to steroidogenic\ndysregulation. The upregulation of androgenic genes such as  3 β -hsd ,  hsd17b1 ,\nand  cyp11a  in the ovary of BPA lineage medaka could\nhave potentially enhanced testosterone biosynthesis in ovarian theca\ncells. This can be validated by a human study in which a positive\nassociation of increased free testosterone (hyperandrogenemia) was\nfound with increased visceral fat deposits in women with PCOS. 117  This clearly suggests that transgenerational\ndeposition of visceral fat could be due to the biosynthesis of testosterone\nin BPA lineage females. In contrast, the expression of C yp19a1a , the gene encoding estrogen-synthesizing enzyme aromatase, was increased\nin the ovary of the BPA lineage females. The fold change of androgenic\ngenes was more significant than that of estrogen-synthesizing genes,\nindicating an increase in the hypothetical ratio of androgen/estrogen,\na characteristic of PCOS. 118  An  in vitro  study found that hyperactivation of  lhr  increases adenylate cyclase, which triggers the synthesis of  3 β -hsd. 119 , 120  Increased levels of LH boost the synthesis of androgen from theca\ncells of the ovary leading to ovarian dysfunction. 121 , 122  Congruent with our observation, the upregulation of  lhr  expression could have induced the upregulation of  3 β -hsd , enhancing androgen synthesis in the\novary. As a result, dysregulation of the steroidogenic pathway could\nhave contributed to potential reproductive impairment related to the\nPCOS phenotype in the F4 BPA lineage fish.\n\nPCOS-specific DEGs\nactivated in the ovary of BPA lineage fish were\ncompared with the PCOS patient transcriptome data set. In total, 292\ncommon significant DEGs were determined, potentially contributing\nto pathogenesis, including genes associated with activating the TNF\nsignaling pathway, endocrine resistance, and cancer pathway. Consistent\nwith GSEA analysis, IPA revealed canonical pathways such as autophagic\nmechanism, cell cycle regulation, cellular stress and injury, and\ncancer pathway with the activation of AKT1 and TNF. Interestingly,\ngenes associated with activating the cancerous pathway, i.e.,  myc ,  akt1 ,  apc , and  mtor , were upregulated in the ovary of the BPA lineage group.\nAlternatively, the ovary of the BPA lineage group showed decreased\nexpression of  foxo1  and tumor suppressor gene ( smad 4 ) genes. Upregulation of c-MYC, enhanced AKT activity,\nactivated protein C (APC), and reduced FOXO3a activity were observed\nin epithelial ovarian carcinoma. 123 − 126  In line with a previous study\nconducted by Bornstein  et al.  showing that a loss\nin SMAD4 increases genomic instability associated with the TGF-β\nsignaling in ovarian cancer, increased expression of  tgf- β in the ovary of BPA lineage was detected, suggesting an advanced\nstage of ovarian disease. 127  Among the\ntop 10 upregulated genes, three genes, namely,  selenop ,  RNA-nf1 , and  olfml3 , were associated\nwith sex-hormone modulation 128  and found\nin PCOS follicular fluid, 129  controlling\ncell cycle progression associated with ovarian teratoma. 130  In the top 10 downregulated genes,  fabp6  and  arl6  (ADP ribosylation factor\nlike GTPase6) were involved in ovarian disease 131  and modulating membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal function. 132  As transcriptional dysregulation and diseases\nare influenced by chromatin organization, 133  we were interested in deciphering epigenetic gene expression controlling\nthe transcriptional output of the cell. Among the 91 DEGs found to\nbe involved in chromatin organization,  kdm2b ,  ehmt1 ,  hdac4 ,  kmt2d ,  jmjd6 ,  ctcf ,  setd5 ,  suz12 ,  btaf1 , and  bahd1  were all upregulated, whereas  dnmt3ba  and  dnmt3b  were downregulated, indicating transgenerational\nalteration of epigenetic genes associated with PCOS phenotype in the\novary of BPA lineage. Previous studies showed that upregulation of\nKDM2B and HDAC and dysregulation of EHMT1/2 are linked to DNA damage\nand dysregulation of the cell cycle, and overexpression of  HDAC  is linked to ovarian cancer. 134 , 135  Together with the published literature, differential expression\nof PCOS-specific genes and epigenetic genes linked to histone modifications\nand DNA methylation indicates a role of epigenetic genes associated\nwith PCOS phenotype in the ovary of BPA lineage fish.\n\nIn the\novary of the BPA lineage fish, several transforming growth\nfactors (TGFs) were differentially expressed, indicating activation\nof several downstream genes such as fibrotic genes such as  col1a1b ,  cola2 ,  col2a1a ,  jun ,  foxo3 ,  sp1 , and  olfml3  and extracellular matrix protein genes.\nIn addition, the expressions of  hspa5  and  eif2ak3  (unfolded protein response (UPR) genes) were upregulated\nin the BPA lineage ovary compared to control, indicating that ER stress\nresponse could have potentially activated the TGF β pathway. 136  The ovary of the BPA lineage fish showed significant\nupregulation of several transforming growth factors, including upstream\nregulators  tgfb1  and  tgfb3 , indicating\nthe activation of several downstream fibrotic genes such as  col1a1b ,  cola2 ,  col2a1a ,  jun ,  foxo3 , and  sp1 . The ovary of the BPA lineage fish also showed extracellular tissue\ndeposition in accordance with the activation of fibrotic genes and\nextracellular matrix protein gene  olfml3 . Expression\nof genes related to ER stress, UPR, and TGF-1 was upregulated in granulosa\ncells of the ovary and was linked to tissue fibrosis. 137 − 140  Extracellular matrix accumulation in the form of collagen deposition\nin the ovarian capsule of the BPA lineage is linked to PCOS pathogenesis. 141  Using GSEA analysis, 94 DEGS were identified\nas associated with autophagy, including upregulated  atg3 ,  becn2 , and  casp3  and downregulated\nfoxo1 genes, suggesting aberrant autophagic mechanism activated in\nthe ovary of the BPA lineage. The literature suggests that ATG3 and\nFoxo1 levels are downregulated in PCOS patients and that decreased\nlevels of autophagy markers (ATG7 and BECN1) directly inhibit oocyte\nmaturation. 142 , 143  Moreover, an elevated  caspase3  expression in the ovary, which is a biomarker for\nPCOS, can trigger aberrant apoptosis resulting in the development\nof cysts resulting from degenerated follicles found in the ovary of\nthe BPA lineage. 144  Direct exposure to\nBPA has been found to activate proinflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNFα\nthat are involved in fibrosis. 145  However,\nin transgenerational PCOS ovaries, activation of the TGF signaling\npathway and ER stress response was synergistically involved in fibrosis\ninduced by ancestral BPA exposure.\n\nCompared with the previous\nmetabolomic studies on follicular fluid\nfrom PCOS patients, the changes in several metabolites in the ovary\nof BPA lineage were consistent with PCOS patients. 81  Mutual metabolites were significantly enriched in sphingolipid\nmetabolism, glutathione metabolism, taurine, hypotaurine metabolism,\nand phenylalanine metabolism. An abnormal expression of sphingolipids\nsuch as lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines was\nfound to be associated with PCOS. 82  Physiological\ndeviations in amino acid concentrations may lead to pathogenic conditions,\nsuch as oxidative stress and ovarian disease, as well as metabolic\ndisturbances, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. 146 − 148  A high abundance of valine, histidine, tryptophan, and creatinine\nwas found in the BPA lineage group. In agreement with our finding,\nan analysis performed by Zhao  et al.  found that the\nlevels of alanine, valine, serine, threonine, ornithine, phenylalanine,\ntyrosine, and tryptophan are generally increased and the levels of\nglycine and proline are reduced in plasma samples of PCOS patients. 82  In the present study, PCOS-specific pathways,\nincluding arginine biosynthesis, 149 , 150  aminoacyl-tRNA\nbiosynthesis, 151 , 152  beta-alanine metabolism, 150  proline and arginine metabolism, 153 , 154  taurine metabolism, 155  and phenylalanine\nmetabolism, 150  were activated in the ovary\nof the BPA lineage group, suggesting that metabolic alterations were\npromoted by ancestral BPA exposure effect.\n\nThe present results\nfrom a human–fish comparative metabolomics–transcriptome\nanalysis show distinctly altered ABC transporter, central carbon metabolism\nin cancer, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, protein digestion, and absorption\npathways, indicating that BPA has a potential role in the development\nof PCOS in fish and humans. Changes in the ATP binding cassette transporter\n1 (ABC1) gene, which encodes the protein regulating entry and exit\nfrom the cell membrane, may contribute to dyslipidemia in patients\nwith PCOS. 156 , 157  In addition, the top five significantly\nenriched KEGG pathways for PCOS vs premature ovarian follicle (POF)\ngroup metabolites included protein digestion and absorption pathways,\nABC transporter-dependent pathways, central carbon metabolism pathways\nin cancer, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway, and prostate cancer\npathways found in human studies. 158  Additionally,\narginine proline metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, and lysosomal\npathways were found to be involved in ancestral BPA exposure-induced\nPCOS. A KEGG pathway analysis indicated that insulin signaling, MAPK\nsignaling, AMPK signaling pathway, and autophagic pathway were enriched\nby total upregulated genes, whereas Rap1, cAMP, and AGE-RAGE signaling\npathways were enriched by total downregulated genes, indicating PCOS-specific\npathways in the ovary of the BPA lineage. Activation of the Rap1 signaling\npathway is found in cancer, and AGE-RAGE signaling is involved in\nthe pathogenesis of diabetes. 159 , 160  Several studies have\nshown that PCOS is associated with impaired insulin signaling, aberrant\nMAPK signaling, and abnormal AMPK signaling in ovarian cumulus and\ngranulosa cells. 66 , 161 , 162  The present results, together with the published literature on PCOS\ndevelopment and progression, show that ancestral BPA exposure seems\nto have activated deleterious signaling pathways in the ovary of the\nBPA lineage leading to advanced-stage ovarian disease. The PCOS phenotype\nwas observed in females that developed severe NALFD.\n\nThe presence\nof low  apoB  transcript in the liver\nof BPA lineage females was accompanied by significant fat accumulation,\nsuggesting that a lack of fat molecules released by the liver may\nhave contributed to abnormal fat accumulation, as indicated by the\noil and red stain in the liver. Downregulation of  apoB  isoforms may result in low levels of TGs and cholesterol in the\ncirculation as well as an extensive accumulation of lipid droplets\nin hepatocytes, indicating the development of NAFLD phenotype. 163  In BPA lineage females, the levels of  shbg  mRNAs were significantly decreased in the liver, suggesting\nanother possible link between transgenerational PCOS and NAFLD. The\nPCOS biomarker SHBG protein is a circulating homodimeric glycoprotein\nsynthesized by hepatocytes with a stronger affinity for testosterone\nthan estrogen. 164  The expression of  shbg  was decreased in the liver of the BPA lineage females.\nSuch a decrease in expression has been found to positively correlate\nwith the bioavailability of free testosterone, 165  hyperandrogenism, 166  fatty liver\ndisease, hyperinsulinemia, and PCOS. These observations reflect a\ncross talk between the hepato-ovarian axis in BPA lineage fish. Additionally,\nthe F4 generation of the BPA lineage group showed highly upregulated  esr1  and  vtg3  transcripts in the liver,\nindicating estrogen-mediated induction of vitellogenin synthesis that\nenhances fat body synthesis in the liver. 167  However, the uptake of vitellogenin via the vitellogenin receptor\nin the ovary is highly important for the maturation of oocytes in\nteleost to maintain a steady state of follicular balance. 168  In the BPA lineage fish, vitellogenin receptor\n( vtgr ) expression was significantly reduced, suggesting\na perturbed vitellogenin uptake that could have prevented the transition\nfrom previtellogenic to vitellogenic oocytes and promoted the immature\nfollicular state related to the PCOS phenotype in the BPA lineage\nfish.\n\nThe present results demonstrate a multidisease phenotype\nof NAFLD–PCOS\nin females four generations after direct embryonic BPA exposure at\nF0 generation. At this time of embryonic development, the liver and\ngonadal germline cells are differentiating from their progenitor cells.\nResults suggest that BPA exposure not only causes PCOS in an immediate\ngeneration but also can cause multidisease phenotype in offspring\nafter several generations, via germline transmission. Integration\nof both transcriptomic and metabolomic results revealed the presence\nof affected metabolic routes in the ovary of the BPA lineage, suggesting\na potential mechanism underlying transgenerational reproductive impairment.\nTogether with the transgenerational inheritance concept of the published\nliterature, the present study suggests that ancestral BPA exposure-induced\nmolecular memories, not yet discovered, may be promoting these multidisease\nphenotypes. Environmentally established molecular memories are transferred\nfrom the germline to the somatic cells (e.g., liver and ovary). 7  To demonstrate causative relationships between\ngermline epigenome and observed transgenerational phenotypic traits\nin the ovary and liver, it is imperative to screen the ancestral germline\nepimutations induced by BPA and correlate them with epigenomes of\nliver and ovary of subsequent generations and their manipulation by\nCRISPR-mediated epigenome editing to understand their role in the\ndevelopment of multidisease phenotypes."

  "full_text": "As a heterogeneous reproductive disorder, polycystic\novary syndrome\n(PCOS) can be caused by genetic, diet, and environmental factors.\nBisphenol A (BPA) can induce PCOS and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\n(NAFLD) due to direct exposure; however, whether these phenotypes\npersist in future unexposed generations is not currently understood.\nIn a previous study, we observed that transgenerational NAFLD persisted\nin female medaka for five generations (F4) after exposure to an environmentally\nrelevant concentration (10 μg/L) of BPA. Here, we demonstrate\nPCOS in the same F4 generation female medaka that developed NAFLD.\nThe ovaries contained immature follicles, restricted follicular progression,\nand degenerated follicles, which are characteristics of PCOS. Untargeted\nmetabolomic analysis revealed 17 biomarkers in the ovary of BPA lineage\nfish, whereas transcriptomic analysis revealed 292 genes abnormally\nexpressed, which were similar to human patients with PCOS. Metabolomic–transcriptomic\njoint pathway analysis revealed activation of the cancerous pathway,\narginine–proline metabolism, insulin signaling, AMPK, and HOTAIR\nregulatory pathways, as well as upstream regulators  esr1  and  tgf  signaling in the ovary. The present results\nsuggest that ancestral BPA exposure can lead to PCOS phenotypes in\nthe subsequent unexposed generations and warrant further investigations\ninto potential health risks in future generations caused by initial\nexposure to EDCs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nSince the middle of the\n20th century, there has been substantial\ngrowth in the development and production of industrial chemicals.\nBPA is one of the most widely manufactured chemicals and an environmental\ncontaminant worldwide. BPA can induce epigenetic alteration in germline\nstem cells and gametes. 1 − 3  Aside from causing adverse reproductive and nonreproductive\nhealth outcomes in the directly exposed generations, BPA can also\ncontribute to transgenerational health outcomes in several subsequent\ngenerations. 4 , 5  Various BPA-induced transgenerational\nhealth effects have been reported in animal models, such as diminished\nfertilization rate 6 , 7  and osmoregulatory gene expression, 8  cardiac disorders, 9 , 10  social recognition\nand behavioral variations, 11  and reproductive\nand metabolic diseases. 5 , 12  Because of its widespread health\neffects, BPA has been banned in North America and the European Union\nin certain consumer goods. 13 − 15  Although BPA is currently banned,\nthe current ban may not completely protect future generations’\nreproductive and metabolic health because ancestral BPA exposure-induced\nepigenetic changes in germ cells can be passed on to somatic cells\nof future generations, leading to impaired metabolic and reproductive\nhealth. 4 , 5  We have previously demonstrated that ancestral\nBPA exposure could cause transgenerational nonalcoholic fatty liver\ndisease (NAFLD), which can persist for five generations in medaka. 16  In fish, the liver plays an intrinsic role in\nfemale reproduction by providing the major egg yolk precursor protein,\ni.e., vitellogenin, that supports embryo development and larvae by\nsupplementing protein and lipid-rich nutrients.\n\nTypically, ovarian\nfunction depends largely on the hypothalamus–pituitary–ovary\n(HPO) axis activated by GnRH pulsatility followed by releases of pituitary-derived\ngonadotropins such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing\nhormone (LH), and sex steroids (estrogen, progesterone, testosterone)\nsecreted by gonads. 17 , 18  As the most common female reproductive\ndisease, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by an\nimbalance between FSH and LH, inhibited follicle maturation, formation\nof multiple small cysts due to degeneration of follicles, and an increase\nin free testosterone. 19 , 20  Up to 75% of women of reproductive\nage suffer from PCOS due to hormonal imbalance, making it the most\nprevalent endocrine disease among premenopausal women. 21  As an acute endocrine disruptor, BPA dysregulates\nFSH and LH levels followed by abnormal folliculogenesis, 22  hinders embryo implantation, 23  alters estrous cyclicity, 24  and\nupregulates AMH, causing an increase in the number of preovulatory\nfollicles. 25  BPA is presumed to be an epigenetically\ntoxic compound. 26  Aside from causing adverse\nhealth outcomes in the exposed generation, BPA can also contribute\nto transgenerational health outcomes through abnormal epigenetic changes\nin germ cells via germline transmission. 27 , 28  In a previous study, polycystic ovarian syndrome was positively\ncorrelated with metabolic diseases such as NAFLD 29  and deregulation of estrogen signaling, 30 − 32  suggesting\ncross talk between the hepato-ovarian axis. A positive correlation\nhas been found between PCOS and biopsy-confirmed NAFLD 33 − 35  at an intragenerational level; however, whether this relationship\nis heritable at the transgenerational level is not currently understood.\nThe proposed study further investigates this issue by incorporating\nphenotypic and omics approaches.\n\nA multidisease phenotype can\ndevelop in organisms due to direct\nexposure to environmental chemicals; however, the mechanisms underlying\nsuch compounded adverse health outcomes are not clearly understood.\nNeither is it clearly understood whether such phenotypes persist in\norganisms in subsequent generations after the remediation of the environmental\ncontamination. Using a multi-omics (integrated transcriptomics and\nmetabolomics) approach, the present study examined heritable NAFLD–PCOS,\na multidisease phenotype, in medaka fish whose ancestors were exposed\nto BPA during their first 15 days of life and never thereafter. Fish,\nsuch as medaka and zebrafish, serve as biomedical animal models to\nstudy human diseases, including NAFLD and PCOS. 36 − 40  Because of the conserved mechanism for processing\nepigenetic information in post-fertilization stage embryos and primordial\ngerm cells with mice and humans, medaka becomes an ideal animal model\nto study the environmentally induced epigenetic inheritance of transgenerational\ndisease phenotype. 39 , 41\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\nThe Hd-rR\nstrain of medaka was used. 42  The exposure\nand procedure for handling fish and euthanization were approved by\nthe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University\nof North Carolina Greensboro (#20-002). Adult medaka fish were maintained\nin 20 L glass aquaria on a light–dark cycle of 14:10 h with\na recirculatory water system with an exchange of 25% water every 4\nh at 26 ± 1 °C and fed three times a day with Otohime granular\nfood and newly hatched brine shrimp ( Artemia  nauplii).\nEmbryos were incubated in glass Petri dishes and larvae in 1 L tanks\nuntil they could feed and swim independently. The larvae at above\n25 dpf stage were transferred to 5 gal glass tanks for rearing until\nend point measurement. For this study, 4 month old adult medaka females\nwere used.\n\nBisphenol A exposure\ncan affect metabolic and reproductive health at various concentrations. 43 − 47  The present study is the downstream analytical part of a bigger\ntransgenerational study. The concentration of BPA was selected after\ntesting a dose–response curve, and the concentration of BPA\nselected was 10 μg/L, which is realistic with regard to the\nenvironmental concentration in many regions of the world. 48 , 49  The measured concentration of BPA was within <10% of the calculated\nconcentration throughout the exposure period, and uptake was measured\nto be 20 pg/mg egg/day as previously described. 48 , 49  BPA exposure was initiated 8 h post fertilization stage (hpf) and\ncontinued until day 15 after fertilization (dpf) with a renewal of\nexposure once daily. BPA exposure was designed to include epigenetic\nreprogramming events in germ cells and to avoid epigenetic reprogramming\nof embryos that takes place between fertilization and blastula stages\n(8 hpf). After the BPA exposure was complete, the F0 generation (exposed\nindividuals) and subsequent generations (offspring) were raised in\nclean water without exposure to BPA. The exposure window thus included\na critical developmental window for sex determination and liver differentiation. 50  The use of initial BPA exposure (10 μg/L)\nat F0 generation was previously reported to cause NAFLD, fertilization\ndefects, and increased embryo mortality in subsequent unexposed generations\nof medaka. 8 , 16 , 48\n\nGeneration of the BPA-exposed transgenerational\nlines of medaka was previously described. 51  Briefly, following BPA exposure for 15 days, larvae were raised\nin clean water until they became adults, designated as F0 adults (intragenerational\ndue to direct exposure to BPA). At 120 days postfertilization, all\nexperimental medaka reached sexual maturity and spawned. 52  A total of six pairs of fish from the F0 generation\nwere bred at 120 days postfertilization to produce F1 (intergenerational).\nThe same mating methodology was used to produce subsequent generations\nup to F4 (the fifth generation, transgenerational).\n\nThe fish from BPA-exposed and control lineages\nwere bred in glass tanks at a ratio of three females and two males\nfor 7 days. Each morning, eggs laid by females were collected and\nexamined under a microscope to determine fecundity and fertilization\nstatus. Fecundity was calculated as the average number of eggs laid\nper female per day. Eggs were examined under a stereoscope to confirm\nfertilization according to the methods previously described. 53  A two-tailed  t  test was performed\nbetween the F4 generation of BPA lineage and the control group to\ndetermine statistical significance.\n\nTo examine\nwhether the BPA lineage fish develop PCOS-like syndrome in adulthood\n(120 dpf), 15 females from each group (BPA lineage and control lineage)\nwere euthanized with MS-222 (250 mg/L). The ovary and liver of both\ngroups were dissected, weighed, and divided into two halves. For RNA/DNA\nextraction, half of the ovary and liver were fixed in RNA/DNA shield\nsolution (Zymo Research, CA) and the other half in Bouin’s\nsolution for histopathological analysis. Hepatosomatic index (HSI),\ngonadosomatic index (GSI), and body mass index (BMI) were calculated\nas liver weight (g) × 100/body weight (g), ovary weight (g) ×\n100/body weight (g), 54  and [body weight\n(g) – ovary weight (g)]/body length (cm 2 ), respectively.\nVisceral fat was collected to quantify adipose tissue (see  Supporting Information ). For histological examination,\nsamples were embedded in low-temperature paraffin, sectioned at 5\nμm thickness in a microtome, and stained with hematoxylin following\noptimized histological protocol. 16  To determine\nfat accumulation, liver samples from the control and BPA lineages\nwere fixed in the Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound, sectioned\nin a cryotome at 15 μm thickness, and used for Oil Red O staining.\n\nOn the basis of\nfollicular development, the ovary of the medaka was categorized into\nfive developmental stages according to the literature previously published. 55  Stage I contained primary follicles with intense\nbasophilic cytoplasm with a peripherally located nucleus. Stage II\ncontained cortical alveolar stage oocytes. Stage III contained yolk\nin vitellogenic oocytes with conspicuous zona radiata. Stage IV contained\nabundant yolk granules in late vitellogenic oocytes with peripheral\nmigration of the germinal vesicle. Stage V contained mature stage\noocytes without germinal vesicles, according to the published literature. 56  Developmental stages of the ovary were measured\nin both groups (BPA lineage and control), and the two-way analysis\nof variance was used to evaluate the significance of differences in\ndifferent stages of folliculogenesis.\n\nHyperplasia of granulosa\ncells; thinning, invasion, and breakdown of the zona radiata; disintegration\nof the basal membrane; and absorption of vitellus are the characteristics\nof atretic follicles. 57  The ImageJ software\nwas used to measure the follicular area. The atretic follicles from\ncontrol and BPA-lineage fish were analyzed by measuring the follicular\narea using the ImageJ software. The reference value was taken from\nthe mean area of the atretic follicles (1p 2 ) in the control\novaries. Atretic follicles with a diameter greater than 1p 2  were considered as big atretic follicles. Blind tests were conducted\nby two different lab members to characterize different stages of folliculogenesis\nand atretic follicles. The results were consistent among all testers.\n\nThe ovaries of control and BPA lineage female\nfish (15 individuals from each lineage) were used for total RNA extraction\nby using a Quick RNA/DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (#D-7003, Zymo Research,\nCA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol as previously\ndescribed. 58  RNA quality was tested by\nbleach gel electrophoresis, 59  and the quantity\nwas determined by Nanodrop 2000 and Qubit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,\nMA). The RNA of the ovary from three females was pooled as one biological\nreplicate per group. Transcriptome libraries were prepared using a\nNEBNext Ultra II RNA Kit and the manufacturer’s protocol. The\nlibraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X (Novogene Corporation,\nCA, USA) using a 150 bp paired-end sequencing strategy (short reads),\nproducing 20–40 million reads per biological replicate.\n\nThe reads were first preprocessed with fastp 0.23.2, 60  an ultrafast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor, which performs\nquality control, adapter trimming, quality filtering, per-read quality\npruning, and many other operations with a single scan of the FASTQ\ndata. The processed reads were then mapped to the medaka genome (Oryzias_latipes.ASM223467v1)\nusing STAR 2.7.7a. 61  Finally, DESeq2 v1.34.0\nwas used to do the differential expression analysis. 62  GSEA analysis was done using the GSEA Preranked tool (GSEA\nv4.1). 63 , 64  For GSEA analysis, only genes showing twofold\nup- or downregulation were considered. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments\nwere obtained using “C5: ontology gene sets” of the\nMSigDB collection. 65\n\nA predefined\nset of PCOS specific DEGs was obtained from public human patient data\nsets: GSE34526125, GSE10946126, and ArrayExpress accession number\nE-MEXP-3641127. 66 − 68  The DEGs (FDR 0.05 and Log2FC > 0.5) from the\nmedaka\novary RNA-seq were compared with the PCOS patient data set. 66  Overlapping DEGs between BPA lineage and PCOS\npatient group were selected and illustrated by using VENNY ( http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html ). The PCOS-specific DEGs represented in the ovary of the BPA lineage\ngroup were used, and predicted pathways were constructed using ShinyGO\n0.76.3. 69\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from\nthe ovary and liver of the F4 generation fish using a Quick RNA/DNA\nMiniprep Plus Kit (#D-7003, Zymo Research, CA, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer’s protocol involving  Dnase I  treatment\nof RNA as previously described. 58  The RNA\nwas reconstituted in 20 μL of nuclease-free water (Zymo Research,\nCA, USA) followed by testing RNA integrity by bleach gel electrophoresis 59  and quantified by Qubit and Nanodrop 2000 (A260/280\nbetween 1.8 and 2). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA\nwas performed on each sample using a high-capacity reverse transcription\nkit (Applied Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions\nas previously described. 53 , 70  RT-qPCR was performed\nin a QuantStudio 3 Real-time PCR equipment (Applied Biosystems) using\ngene-specific primers ( Table S1 ) and the\n2 –ΔΔCt  method. The  rpl7  gene was selected as a stable housekeeping gene after testing the\nexpression pattern of several housekeeping genes. Primers were designed\nusing Primer3web 71  from exon–exon\njunctions to avoid genomic DNA amplification ( Table S1 ).\n\nCanonical pathways were determined by using the IPA software (V01-07;\nQiagen), and molecular and cellular function were determined using\nthe specific Ingenuity Knowledge Database (using default parameters\nfor all tissues and cell lines, with relaxed filters), which provides\na repository of biological interactions and functional annotations.\nDysregulated genes (FDR 0.05 and Log2FC > 0.5) in the ovary of\nF4\ngeneration fish were converted to the corresponding human orthologous\nusing the g-profiler website. 72  Fisher’s\nexact test was applied to calculate the significance of each network.\n\nThe ovaries\nof F4 females from control and BPA lineage were pooled respectively\nand used to extract ovarian metabolites. According to a published\nprotocol, 73  ovary samples (20 mg) were\nhomogenized in an ultrasonically extracted solution consisting of\nmethanol/acetonitrile/water (2:2:1, v/v), vortex mixed, and ultrasonically\nextracted twice at a low temperature for 30 min. After incubation\nat −20 °C for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000\nrpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was lyophilized and stored\nat −80 °C. Before use, the lyophilized sample was dissolved\nin acetonitrile water (1:1, v/v), vortex-mixed, and centrifuged at\n14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was injected into the HPLC–MS/MS\nsystem for metabolomic analysis. To ensure the system’s stability,\neight quality control (QC) samples, including whole adductor muscle\ntissues, were inserted throughout the experiment. Mass spectrometry\nwas performed on a Q Exactive plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,\nMA, USA) equipped with electrospray ionization. The mass spectrometry\noperational protocol was previously published. 74  Both negative and positive ion modes were applied with\na capillary voltage setting of ±5.5 kV during instrument operations.\nThe product ion scan  m / z  range was\n25–1200 Da with a scan accumulation time of 0.03 s/spectrum.\nThe collision energy was set to 30 eV.\n\nMass spectrometric\ndata were analyzed, aligned, and filtered with the MZmine 2.2 software\n( http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/ ) using the procedure previously reported elsewhere. 74  Quantile normalization, cube root transformation, and mean\ncentering were used to process the filtered peaks from 4232 peaks\nin the positive mode and 3569 peaks in the negative mode. The resulting\nfeatures were used to explore the total pathway hit by the Mummichog\nalgorithm installed in Metaboanalyst 5.0. 75  Metabolites associated with pathways were further used for PCA to\nreveal intrinsic feature clusters and detect outliers. To examine\nthe relationship between group and spectral data with variance (R2Y)\nand predictive ability (Q2 parameter), a PLS-DA model was used. The\nresonance of metabolites was putatively annotated bioinformatically\nby using the HMDB database 76  ( http://www.hmdb.ca ) and metlin 77  ( http://metlin.scripps.edu ). To visualize the variations of metabolites between the control\nand BPA lineage group, the significantly altered metabolites in the\nBPA lineage compared with the control lineage were identified based\non the following criteria:  P  < 0.05 and fold change\n≥ ±1. VIP > 1 was used for hierarchical clustering\n(Ward\nclustering, Euclidean distance), univariate analysis  t  test, and pathway analysis using Metaboanalyst 5.0 as previously\ndescribed. 78  To determine metabolomic biomarkers\nof PCOS, the classical univariate ROC curve analysis was performed. 79  The area under the curve (AUC) was generally\nbetween 0.5 and 1.0. When AUC > 0.5 and closer to 1, the model\nperforms\nbetter. 80  However, biomarkers were selected\nbased on strict criteria:  P  < 0.05 and AUC = 1\nfrom the ovary of the BPA lineage. BPA lineage ovary metabolites were\ncompared with the PCOS patient metabolite data set. 81  The abundance of amino acids in the BPA lineage ovary was\nplotted in metabolic pathways associated with polycystic ovary syndrome\n(PCOS). 82\n\nThe GraphPad\nPrism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) software was used for statistical\nanalysis and plotting the results. Comparison of data between BPA\nlineage and control lineage, Student’s  t  test,\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post hoc multiple comparison\ntests (Tukey HSD) were used to determine significant differences.\nDifferences with  P  < 0.05 were considered significant\nand have been marked with asterisks (* P  < 0.05;\n** P  < 0.01; *** P  < 0.001).\n\n## Animal Care and Maintenance\n\nThe Hd-rR\nstrain of medaka was used. 42  The exposure\nand procedure for handling fish and euthanization were approved by\nthe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University\nof North Carolina Greensboro (#20-002). Adult medaka fish were maintained\nin 20 L glass aquaria on a light–dark cycle of 14:10 h with\na recirculatory water system with an exchange of 25% water every 4\nh at 26 ± 1 °C and fed three times a day with Otohime granular\nfood and newly hatched brine shrimp ( Artemia  nauplii).\nEmbryos were incubated in glass Petri dishes and larvae in 1 L tanks\nuntil they could feed and swim independently. The larvae at above\n25 dpf stage were transferred to 5 gal glass tanks for rearing until\nend point measurement. For this study, 4 month old adult medaka females\nwere used.\n\n## Chemical Exposure\n\nBisphenol A exposure\ncan affect metabolic and reproductive health at various concentrations. 43 − 47  The present study is the downstream analytical part of a bigger\ntransgenerational study. The concentration of BPA was selected after\ntesting a dose–response curve, and the concentration of BPA\nselected was 10 μg/L, which is realistic with regard to the\nenvironmental concentration in many regions of the world. 48 , 49  The measured concentration of BPA was within <10% of the calculated\nconcentration throughout the exposure period, and uptake was measured\nto be 20 pg/mg egg/day as previously described. 48 , 49  BPA exposure was initiated 8 h post fertilization stage (hpf) and\ncontinued until day 15 after fertilization (dpf) with a renewal of\nexposure once daily. BPA exposure was designed to include epigenetic\nreprogramming events in germ cells and to avoid epigenetic reprogramming\nof embryos that takes place between fertilization and blastula stages\n(8 hpf). After the BPA exposure was complete, the F0 generation (exposed\nindividuals) and subsequent generations (offspring) were raised in\nclean water without exposure to BPA. The exposure window thus included\na critical developmental window for sex determination and liver differentiation. 50  The use of initial BPA exposure (10 μg/L)\nat F0 generation was previously reported to cause NAFLD, fertilization\ndefects, and increased embryo mortality in subsequent unexposed generations\nof medaka. 8 , 16 , 48\n\n## Production of BPA-Exposed Transgenerational\nOffspring\n\nGeneration of the BPA-exposed transgenerational\nlines of medaka was previously described. 51  Briefly, following BPA exposure for 15 days, larvae were raised\nin clean water until they became adults, designated as F0 adults (intragenerational\ndue to direct exposure to BPA). At 120 days postfertilization, all\nexperimental medaka reached sexual maturity and spawned. 52  A total of six pairs of fish from the F0 generation\nwere bred at 120 days postfertilization to produce F1 (intergenerational).\nThe same mating methodology was used to produce subsequent generations\nup to F4 (the fifth generation, transgenerational).\n\n## Fecundity and Fertilization Efficiency of\nthe F4 Fish\n\nThe fish from BPA-exposed and control lineages\nwere bred in glass tanks at a ratio of three females and two males\nfor 7 days. Each morning, eggs laid by females were collected and\nexamined under a microscope to determine fecundity and fertilization\nstatus. Fecundity was calculated as the average number of eggs laid\nper female per day. Eggs were examined under a stereoscope to confirm\nfertilization according to the methods previously described. 53  A two-tailed  t  test was performed\nbetween the F4 generation of BPA lineage and the control group to\ndetermine statistical significance.\n\n## Tissue Sample Collection\n\nTo examine\nwhether the BPA lineage fish develop PCOS-like syndrome in adulthood\n(120 dpf), 15 females from each group (BPA lineage and control lineage)\nwere euthanized with MS-222 (250 mg/L). The ovary and liver of both\ngroups were dissected, weighed, and divided into two halves. For RNA/DNA\nextraction, half of the ovary and liver were fixed in RNA/DNA shield\nsolution (Zymo Research, CA) and the other half in Bouin’s\nsolution for histopathological analysis. Hepatosomatic index (HSI),\ngonadosomatic index (GSI), and body mass index (BMI) were calculated\nas liver weight (g) × 100/body weight (g), ovary weight (g) ×\n100/body weight (g), 54  and [body weight\n(g) – ovary weight (g)]/body length (cm 2 ), respectively.\nVisceral fat was collected to quantify adipose tissue (see  Supporting Information ). For histological examination,\nsamples were embedded in low-temperature paraffin, sectioned at 5\nμm thickness in a microtome, and stained with hematoxylin following\noptimized histological protocol. 16  To determine\nfat accumulation, liver samples from the control and BPA lineages\nwere fixed in the Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound, sectioned\nin a cryotome at 15 μm thickness, and used for Oil Red O staining.\n\n## Ovary Phenotyping\n\nOn the basis of\nfollicular development, the ovary of the medaka was categorized into\nfive developmental stages according to the literature previously published. 55  Stage I contained primary follicles with intense\nbasophilic cytoplasm with a peripherally located nucleus. Stage II\ncontained cortical alveolar stage oocytes. Stage III contained yolk\nin vitellogenic oocytes with conspicuous zona radiata. Stage IV contained\nabundant yolk granules in late vitellogenic oocytes with peripheral\nmigration of the germinal vesicle. Stage V contained mature stage\noocytes without germinal vesicles, according to the published literature. 56  Developmental stages of the ovary were measured\nin both groups (BPA lineage and control), and the two-way analysis\nof variance was used to evaluate the significance of differences in\ndifferent stages of folliculogenesis.\n\nHyperplasia of granulosa\ncells; thinning, invasion, and breakdown of the zona radiata; disintegration\nof the basal membrane; and absorption of vitellus are the characteristics\nof atretic follicles. 57  The ImageJ software\nwas used to measure the follicular area. The atretic follicles from\ncontrol and BPA-lineage fish were analyzed by measuring the follicular\narea using the ImageJ software. The reference value was taken from\nthe mean area of the atretic follicles (1p 2 ) in the control\novaries. Atretic follicles with a diameter greater than 1p 2  were considered as big atretic follicles. Blind tests were conducted\nby two different lab members to characterize different stages of folliculogenesis\nand atretic follicles. The results were consistent among all testers.\n\n## RNA-Seq\n\nThe ovaries of control and BPA lineage female\nfish (15 individuals from each lineage) were used for total RNA extraction\nby using a Quick RNA/DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (#D-7003, Zymo Research,\nCA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol as previously\ndescribed. 58  RNA quality was tested by\nbleach gel electrophoresis, 59  and the quantity\nwas determined by Nanodrop 2000 and Qubit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,\nMA). The RNA of the ovary from three females was pooled as one biological\nreplicate per group. Transcriptome libraries were prepared using a\nNEBNext Ultra II RNA Kit and the manufacturer’s protocol.

The processed reads were then mapped to the medaka genome (Oryzias_latipes.ASM223467v1)\nusing STAR 2.7.7a. 61  Finally, DESeq2 v1.34.0\nwas used to do the differential expression analysis. 62  GSEA analysis was done using the GSEA Preranked tool (GSEA\nv4.1). 63 , 64  For GSEA analysis, only genes showing twofold\nup- or downregulation were considered. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichments\nwere obtained using “C5: ontology gene sets” of the\nMSigDB collection. 65\n\nA predefined\nset of PCOS specific DEGs was obtained from public human patient data\nsets: GSE34526125, GSE10946126, and ArrayExpress accession number\nE-MEXP-3641127. 66 − 68  The DEGs (FDR 0.05 and Log2FC > 0.5) from the\nmedaka\novary RNA-seq were compared with the PCOS patient data set. 66  Overlapping DEGs between BPA lineage and PCOS\npatient group were selected and illustrated by using VENNY ( http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html ).

The PCOS-specific DEGs represented in the ovary of the BPA lineage\ngroup were used, and predicted pathways were constructed using ShinyGO\n0.76.3. 69\n\n## RT-qPCR\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from\nthe ovary and liver of the F4 generation fish using a Quick RNA/DNA\nMiniprep Plus Kit (#D-7003, Zymo Research, CA, USA) according to the\nmanufacturer’s protocol involving  Dnase I  treatment\nof RNA as previously described. 58  The RNA\nwas reconstituted in 20 μL of nuclease-free water (Zymo Research,\nCA, USA) followed by testing RNA integrity by bleach gel electrophoresis 59  and quantified by Qubit and Nanodrop 2000 (A260/280\nbetween 1.8 and 2). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA\nwas performed on each sample using a high-capacity reverse transcription\nkit (Applied Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions\nas previously described. 53 , 70  RT-qPCR was performed\nin a QuantStudio 3 Real-time PCR equipment (Applied Biosystems) using\ngene-specific primers ( Table S1 ) and the\n2 –ΔΔCt  method. The  rpl7  gene was selected as a stable housekeeping gene after testing the\nexpression pattern of several housekeeping genes. Primers were designed\nusing Primer3web 71  from exon–exon\njunctions to avoid genomic DNA amplification ( Table S1 ).\n\n## Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of DEGs\n\nCanonical pathways were determined by using the IPA software (V01-07;\nQiagen), and molecular and cellular function were determined using\nthe specific Ingenuity Knowledge Database (using default parameters\nfor all tissues and cell lines, with relaxed filters), which provides\na repository of biological interactions and functional annotations.\nDysregulated genes (FDR 0.05 and Log2FC > 0.5) in the ovary of\nF4\ngeneration fish were converted to the corresponding human orthologous\nusing the g-profiler website. 72  Fisher’s\nexact test was applied to calculate the significance of each network.\n\n## Metabolomic Quantification\n\nThe ovaries\nof F4 females from control and BPA lineage were pooled respectively\nand used to extract ovarian metabolites. According to a published\nprotocol, 73  ovary samples (20 mg) were\nhomogenized in an ultrasonically extracted solution consisting of\nmethanol/acetonitrile/water (2:2:1, v/v), vortex mixed, and ultrasonically\nextracted twice at a low temperature for 30 min. After incubation\nat −20 °C for 1 h, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000\nrpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was lyophilized and stored\nat −80 °C. Before use, the lyophilized sample was dissolved\nin acetonitrile water (1:1, v/v), vortex-mixed, and centrifuged at\n14,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was injected into the HPLC–MS/MS\nsystem for metabolomic analysis. To ensure the system’s stability,\neight quality control (QC) samples, including whole adductor muscle\ntissues, were inserted throughout the experiment. Mass spectrometry\nwas performed on a Q Exactive plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,\nMA, USA) equipped with electrospray ionization. The mass spectrometry\noperational protocol was previously published. 74  Both negative and positive ion modes were applied with\na capillary voltage setting of ±5.5 kV during instrument operations.\nThe product ion scan  m / z  range was\n25–1200 Da with a scan accumulation time of 0.03 s/spectrum.\nThe collision energy was set to 30 eV.\n\n## Metabolomic Data Analysis\n\nMass spectrometric\ndata were analyzed, aligned, and filtered with the MZmine 2.2 software\n( http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/ ) using the procedure previously reported elsewhere. 74  Quantile normalization, cube root transformation, and mean\ncentering were used to process the filtered peaks from 4232 peaks\nin the positive mode and 3569 peaks in the negative mode. The resulting\nfeatures were used to explore the total pathway hit by the Mummichog\nalgorithm installed in Metaboanalyst 5.0. 75  Metabolites associated with pathways were further used for PCA to\nreveal intrinsic feature clusters and detect outliers. To examine\nthe relationship between group and spectral data with variance (R2Y)\nand predictive ability (Q2 parameter), a PLS-DA model was used. The\nresonance of metabolites was putatively annotated bioinformatically\nby using the HMDB database 76  ( http://www.hmdb.ca ) and metlin 77  ( http://metlin.scripps.edu ). To visualize the variations of metabolites between the control\nand BPA lineage group, the significantly altered metabolites in the\nBPA lineage compared with the control lineage were identified based\non the following criteria:  P  < 0.05 and fold change\n≥ ±1. VIP > 1 was used for hierarchical clustering\n(Ward\nclustering, Euclidean distance), univariate analysis  t  test, and pathway analysis using Metaboanalyst 5.0 as previously\ndescribed. 78  To determine metabolomic biomarkers\nof PCOS, the classical univariate ROC curve analysis was performed. 79  The area under the curve (AUC) was generally\nbetween 0.5 and 1.0. When AUC > 0.5 and closer to 1, the model\nperforms\nbetter. 80  However, biomarkers were selected\nbased on strict criteria:  P  < 0.05 and AUC = 1\nfrom the ovary of the BPA lineage. BPA lineage ovary metabolites were\ncompared with the PCOS patient metabolite data set. 81  The abundance of amino acids in the BPA lineage ovary was\nplotted in metabolic pathways associated with polycystic ovary syndrome\n(PCOS). 82\n\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nThe GraphPad\nPrism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) software was used for statistical\nanalysis and plotting the results. Comparison of data between BPA\nlineage and control lineage, Student’s  t  test,\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post hoc multiple comparison\ntests (Tukey HSD) were used to determine significant differences.\nDifferences with  P  < 0.05 were considered significant\nand have been marked with asterisks (* P  < 0.05;\n** P  < 0.01; *** P  < 0.001).\n\n## Results\n\nBody mass\nindex (BMI) and gonadosomatic index (GSI) were measured to determine\nthe metabolic health of the F4 females. Compared to the control lineage,\nthe BPA lineage females had significantly increased BMI, visceral\nfat content ( Figure  1 A,B), and hepatosomatic index ( Figure  1 C). However, the GSI ( Figure  1 D) was significantly decreased, suggesting\nthat the F4 fish from the BPA lineage had a reproductive impairment.\n\nAncestral\nBPA exposure caused increased basal metabolic index (BMI),\nvisceral fat accumulation, and hepatosomatic index and reduced gonadosomatic\nindex in BPA lineage females. (A) BMI (mass/length 2 ), (B) visceral fat, (C) hepatosomatic index, and (D) gonadosomatic\nindex. Statistical significance (*** P  < 0.001,  t  test) compared to control lineage.

(H)\nOvary histology (magnification ×40) micrograph in control and\nBPA lineage. (I) Number of follicles in each developmental stage in\nthe ovaries of the BPA and control lineage fish. Asterisks indicate\nstatistically significant differences (*** P  <\n0.001,  t  test). I: primary growth stage; II: cortical\nalveolar stage; III: early vitellogenic stage; IV: late vitellogenic\nstage; V: mature stage; A: atretic follicle. (J) Degenerated follicle\n(black rectangle) with excess interstitial tissue deposition (red\narrow) found in the ovaries of BPA lineage fish. (K) Atretic follicle\nwith damaged chorion found in the ovary of BPA lineage (magnification\n×40) and follicular area.\n\nTo determine whether the females had\nreproductive defects, fecundity was measured, which accounts for the\nproduction of eggs per female in the BPA and control lineage. The\nmean total production of eggs per tank (fecundity) and the number\nof fertilized eggs were significantly decreased ( P  < 0.05) in the BPA lineage group compared to the control group\n( Figure 1 E,F). A 40%\ndecrease in ovary size was observed in the BPA lineage fish ( Figure  1 G) compared to the\ncontrol lineage. The number of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic follicles\nwas significantly decreased in the BPA lineage ( Figure  4 A,B) except for stage II ( Figure  1 H). Overall, a 90% decrease\nin the number of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic follicles was observed.\nMorphometric analysis of the follicular stages showed a significantly\nhigher number of stage I oocytes in the ovary of the BPA lineage fish,\nwhich decreased across stages III through stage V ( Figure  1 J). This indicated that follicular\nprogression was disrupted in the BPA lineage fish. Furthermore, the\nBPA lineage group showed damage in the chorion ( Figure  1 J) and an increased mean area of atretic\nfollicles (3.067 ± 0.6190 p 2 ,  Figure  1 J). Additionally, increased numbers of the\natretic follicles, irregular folding of the surface epithelium, degenerated\nfollicles with abnormal tissue deposition ( Figure  1 K), and hyperplasia of the granulosa cells\nwere found in the ovary, indicating a loss of follicular architecture\nin BPA lineage fish.\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was able\nto separate 74.5% of biological replicates of both the BPA lineage\nand control lineage group into two clusters ( Figure  2 A), indicating that they are different from\neach other. The expression profiles were consistent across all three\nbiological replicates, indicating that sequencing libraries were of\nexcellent quality. In total, 2546 differentially expressed genes (DEGs),\nincluding 2094 upregulated and 452 downregulated genes, were identified\nin the BPA lineage group ( Figure  2 B), as exhibited in the volcano plot ( Figure  2 C). Global alterations in gene\nexpression in BPA lineage ovary are illustrated in a heatmap ( Figure S1 ). The GO analysis was performed to\nevaluate the functional properties of DEGs. GO results showed the\ntop 20 molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components\n( Figure S2 ). Among all biological processes,\ncellular morphogenesis, differentiation, and protein localization\nwere highly enriched by DEGs from the BPA lineage. Cellular components\nand molecular function had DEGs involved in microtubule organization,\ncellular adhesion, and cellular transport mechanism via the Golgi\napparatus. Additionally, using stricter selection criteria (fold change\n≥ 2,  p -adj ≤ 0.01), the top 10 up-\nand downregulated DEGs (biomarker) were selected from the BPA lineage\ngroup ( Figure  2 D).\nMost upregulated genes were enriched in insulin signaling pathway\n( Figure  2 E,  Figure S3 ), MAPK signaling ( Figure  2 E,  Figure S4 ), AMPK signaling pathway ( Figure  2 E,  Figure S5 ),\nand autophagy pathway ( Figure  2 E). Alternatively, downregulated genes were enriched in Rap1\n( Figure  2 F,  Figure S6 ), cAMP ( Figure  2 F,  Figure S7 ),\nand AGE-RAGE signaling pathway ( Figure  2 F,  Figure S7 ).\n\nGlobal transcriptional\nalterations in the ovary. (A) PCA plot showing\na separation of DEGs in BPA from control lineage ovaries. (B) Bar\nplots showing the profile of up- and downregulated genes and (C) log2\nfold-change volcano plot. (D) Top 10 up- and downregulated genes in\nthe ovary of BPA lineage. KEGG pathway analysis of total upregulated\n(E) and downregulated (F) genes in the transcriptome dataset.\n\nGSEA found a positive correlation of upregulated\ngenes with autophagic mechanism ( Figure S8A ), cellular stress response ( Figure S8B ), and chromatin organization ( Figure S8C ). Downregulated DEGs were uniquely enriched with the cell signaling\npart of the biological pathway ( Figure S8D ). Additionally, DEGs were enriched with the cell cycle ( Figure S9A ), catabolic process (Figure S9FB),\nplasma membrane component ( Figure S9C ),\nmitochondria metabolic pathway ( Figure S9D ), apoptosis ( Figure S9E ), and p53 pathway\n( Figure S9F ).\n\nExpression patterns of the\ngenes that are associated with ovarian steroidogenic functions, including  amh ,  hsd17b1 ,  cyp19a1 ,  cyp11a1 ,  3 β -HSD ,\nand  cyp17 , were examined. RNA-seq results showed\na significant upregulation of  Cyp11a1 ,  amh ,  hsd17b1 ,  3 β -HSD ,  Cyp19a1  and a significant downregulation of  cyp17  in the BPA lineage group ( Figure  3 A). The expression of  igf1r  and  igfbp3  was downregulated, whereas  igf2b  expression was significantly upregulated, suggesting abnormal insulin\nsignaling in the ovary ( Figure  3 B). The expression of genes encoding collagen proteins, mainly  col1a1b ,  col1a2 , and  col12a1 , was significantly upregulated ( Figure  3 C). This suggests abnormal tissue deposition\nin the ovary of the BPA linage. In the BPA lineage, specific genes\nencoding kinases, including  mapk1 ,  mapk9 ,  mtor ,  pik3r , and  eif2ak3 , and cytokines, including  il17rd ,  il12rb1 , and  fam118b , were significantly upregulated. However,\nthe expressions of  il22ra2 ,  fam219ab , and  edn3  were significantly downregulated ( Figure  3 D,E). Abnormal expression\nof gene-encoding kinase and cytokine indicates molecular pathogenicity.\nThe expressions of genes involved in malignancy such as  myc ,  akt1 ,  apc ,  mtor ,  bcl2l1 ,  daxx , and  jun  were significantly upregulated, and only  smad4  and  src  genes were downregulated in the ovary of the BPA lineage\ngroup ( Figure  3 F).\nAdditionally, essential transcription factors, such as  esr1 ,  foxp3 ,  smad 2 ,  ar , nfkb1, nothch1, klf9, and stat5 involved in the disease pathway\nwere also identified ( Figure  3 G).\n\nAbnormality in the expression of genes encoding (A) steroidogenic\nmetabolism, (B) insulin signaling, (C) collagen synthesis, (D) kinase,\n(E) cytokine, and (F) cancerous genes. (G) List of significant transcription\nfactors and their network in the ovary of the BPA lineage fish. Transcriptional\nalterations in gonadotrophin receptor genes in the ovaries of the\nBPA lineage fish. A significant increase in (H)  lhr  and (I)  3 β -hsd  transcripts\nwas observed in the BPA lineage ovaries. A significant decrease in\n(J)  fshr  and (K)  vtgr  transcript\nlevels was found in the BPA lineage. A significantly abundant transcript\nof (L)  caspase 3  was measured in the BPA lineage\novaries. Asterisk indicates statistical significance at the level\nof * P  < 0.05,  t  test compared\nagainst control lineage.\n\nThe mRNA levels of  lhr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 H) and  3 β -hsd  ( P  < 0.01,  Figure  3 I) were significantly increased in the ovary\nof the BPA lineage. However, mRNAs of  fshr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 J) and  vtgr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 K) were significantly\ndecreased in the ovary of the BPA lineage group. This indicated transgenerational\ndysregulation of steroidogenesis and reproduction-related pathways\nin the BPA lineage fish. Additionally, the levels of  caspase3  mRNAs were significantly increased ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 L) in the ovary of\nthe BPA lineage, suggesting increased apoptosis-mediated cell death\nin the ovary of the BPA lineage fish.\n\nDEGs of BPA lineage\nPCOS fish were compared with publicly available human PCOS patient\nDEGs to identify end-point specific (PCOS) DEGs associated with ancestrally\ninduced PCOS (end point) in the F4 generation. 66  In total, 292 common DEGs were found from the total of\n1374 DEGs found in the human PCOS patient data set ( Figure  4 A). Additionally, 82 DEGs were mutually upregulated in both\nBPA lineage and PCOS patients. Among the total shared DEGs in BPA\nand PCOS patient groups, 37 DEGs were mutually downregulated. However,\n173 shared DEGs showed exclusive expression patterns in the BPA lineage\n( Figure  4 A). From the\ntotal shared DEGs, the top 15 mutually upregulated (Log2FC > 2),\ndownregulated\n(Log2FC < −1), and exclusive BPA-specific DEGs are illustrated\n( Figure  4 B–D).\nHeatmaps show shared common total DEGs between BPA lineage and PCOS\npatients ( Figure S10A–D ). The comparative\nanalysis revealed that the BPA lineage ovaries have similar gene expression\npatterns to human PCOS patients. KEGG pathway analysis on 292 DEGs\nshowed significant enrichment in TNF signaling, IL signaling, growth\nhormone synthesis, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure  4 E). The transcriptome\ndatabase has been submitted to NCBI as  GSE226322  (token # qtqrqoycjtqfxqb).\n\nComparison\nof DEGs found in the PCOS patient data set with those\nin the ovaries of BPA lineage fish.

(D) Top 15 mutual BPA-specific\nDEGs and (E) KEGG pathway enrichment on common DEGs.\n\nTo further understand the biological pathway involved in diseased\nphenotype induced by ancestral BPA exposure, the RNA-seq data were\nannotated into human IDs for core functional analysis using IPA. Canonical\npathways enriched in the molecular mechanism of cancer ( P  value 2.15E-09), autophagy ( P  value 2.95E-08),\nHOTAIR regulatory pathway ( P  value 3.00E-07), cellular\nstress and injury, cell cycle and transcriptional regulation, apoptosis,\ncytokine signaling, and immune response were determined ( Figure  5 A). DEGs were involved\nin the molecular mechanism of cancer ( Figure S11 ), autophagy ( Figure S12 ), and HOTAIR\n( Figure S13 ). Additionally, the gene-disease\nnetwork analysis showed that  akt1  and  tnf  are master regulators of various disease pathways, such as HOTAIR\nregulatory pathways, AMPK signaling, growth failure, and autophagy,\nwhich are all indicative of severe ovarian disease due to ancestral\nBPA exposure ( Figure S14 ). Using the upstream\nregulator analysis (URA) tool, IPA can identify potential upstream\nregulators by analyzing linkage to DEGs via coordinated expression. 83  A total of 94 transcription regulators were\nidentified, and the top 15 transcription regulators were determined\n( Figure S15 ). e sr1  (estrogen\nreceptor1) and  tgfb1  (transforming growth factor\nbeta 1) were the most significant upstream regulators interacting\nwith several genes such as  jun ,  myc ,  foxo3 ,  smad3 , and  e2f1  ( Figure  5 B,C).\n\nIPA analysis\non the DEGs in the BPA lineage ovaries. (A) Canonical\npathway. Upstream regulator gene networks within the DEGs determined\nby IPA. (B) ESR1 and (C) TGFB1 with interactive networks with downstream\ngenes in the development of ovary pathogenesis.\n\nMetabolomic analysis was conducted to address\nthe alterations in ovarian metabolic profiles due to ancestral BPA\nexposure effect in the BPA-exposed control lineage group. An orthogonal\npartial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed\nto elucidate the differences between the BPA and the control lineage\ngroup. According to the score plot, there was a difference among the\ngroups ( Figure S16 ). In this OPLS-DA model,\nR2X = 0.29, R2Y = 0.91, Q2 = 0.5. Metabolites with VIP > 1 are\nshown\nin  Figure S17  with  m / z , retention time, and HMDB class and IDs. The clustered\nheatmap showed the top 50 significant metabolites and their relative\nabundance ( Figure  6 A), providing useful insights into the relationship between unique\nmetabolites of the BPA lineage and control lineage. The metabolites\nbelonged to amino acids, purine and pyrimidine derivatives, organic\nacids, lipid molecules, sugars, and some other class of molecules.\nLipid molecules such as glucosylceramide; PS (16:0/16:0); amino acids\nmainly  l -histidine, allysine,  l -tryptophan, and  l -valine; and purine derivatives mainly guanosine, xanthine,\nhypoxanthine, and guanine were found in higher abundance in BPA lineage\ngroup. 4,6-Dihydroxyquinoline, vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide, uracil, phosphocreatine,\ncytosine, and  l -aspartic acid were detected but in low abundance.\nDifferential abundance of amino acids from the ovary of the BPA lineage\nfish was mapped in metabolic pathways associated with PCOS ( Figure  6 B). Biomarkers of\nPCOS were found in the ovary metabolite data. With  P  < 0.05 and AUC = 1, a total of 17 biomarkers were found in the\novary of the BPA lineage ( Figure  6 C). Those were inosine, guanosine, phosphocreatine,\n2-methylcitric acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene,  l -palmitoylcarnitine, xanthine, niacinamide, asymmetric dimethylarginine,\nall- trans -retinoic acid, hypoxanthine, nicotinic\nacid, ornithine, 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1D-myo-inositol, glucosylceramide,\nand allysine ( Figure S17 ). The top 25 highly\nenriched metabolic pathways were identified. Metabolically important\npathways such as arginine biosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis,\nhistidine metabolism, proline metabolism, and glutathione metabolism\nwere highly enriched in the BPA lineage ovary ( Figure S18 ).\n\nGlobal metabolic alterations in the ovary of BPA lineage\nfish.\n(A) Heatmap showing a differential abundance of the top 50 significant\nmetabolites. (B) The abundance profile of amino acids in the PCOS\nmetabolic pathway. (C) Table of biomarkers and the list of ovarian\nmetabolites.\n\nTo investigate potential metabolites linked to transgenerational\nPCOS, the metabolites of F4 ovary from BPA lineage were compared with\nthe PCOS patient metabolite data. 81  A total\nof 16 metabolites were found to be common between BPA lineage and\nPCOS patients ( Figure  7 A). Among the 16 metabolites, 8 common metabolites showed a mutual\npattern of abundance, and 7 of them showed an exclusive abundance\npattern in the ovary of BPA lineage. Pregnenolone, eicosapentaenoic\nacid, phytosphingosine, azelaic acid, sphinganine, phenylpyruvic acid,\nornithine, and inosine showed similar abundance patterns in the ovary\nof BPA lineage and PCOS patient data set ( Figure  6 A). However, creatinine, taurine, uridine,\nand taurine exhibited an exclusive pattern of abundance under common\nmetabolites ( Figure  6 A). KEGG pathway analysis was conducted on common metabolites found\nin the ovary of BPA lineage and human patients. These pathways included\nsphingolipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine\nand tryptophan metabolism, taurine metabolism, and hypotaurine metabolism\n( Figure S18 ).\n\nComparison of metabolites\nbetween the PCOS patient data set and\nthe ovary of BPA lineage fish. (A) A Venn diagram showing overlapped\nmetabolites in both the PCOS patient data set and the ovary of BPA\nlineage fish. (B) Joint pathway analysis of transcriptome and metabolomes\nwith list of the pathways with total hits,  P  value,\nand FDR.\n\nSignificantly altered metabolites and genes\nwere submitted to joint pathway analysis in Metaboanalyst. 84  Out of the 324 biological processes identified,\n74 pathways had  P  value < 0.05 and FDR < 25%.\nThe top three pathways based on the calculation of  P  value were the ABC transporter, carbon metabolism in cancer, and\narginine biosynthesis ( Figure  7 B). The gene–metabolite interaction network and metabolite–metabolite\ninteraction network are shown in  Figure S19 . Metabolites found in carbon metabolism for triggering cancer were\nmapped in  Figure S20 . The insulin signaling,\nendocytosis, and cancer-related pathways that were found prominent\nin both omics were also significantly enriched in the integrative\nanalysis.\n\nThe liver in the BPA lineage\nfemales had more vacuolated hepatocytes than in the control lineage\nfish ( Figure  8 A). The\nhepatic cells were arranged in sheets separated by sinusoidal meshes.\nTo determine if ancestral BPA exposure caused lipid accumulation in\nthe liver, which is also a symptom of NAFLD, Oil Red O was used to\nstain hepatic neutral lipids. Consistent with their higher hepatosomatic\nindex (HSI), cryosections of the livers of the BPA lineage females\nshowed a proportional accumulation of neutral lipids ( Figure  8 B), indicating the liver of\nBPA lineage developing NAFLD.\n\nAncestral BPA exposure resulted in liver steatosis\nin females of\nthe F4 generation. (A) Liver histology micrograph. (B) Fat accumulation\nin the liver of the F4 generation females (magnification ×40).\nTransgenerational alterations in the expression of genes in BPA lineage\nlivers. Significant decrease in (C)  shbg  and (D)  apoba  transcript in BPA lineage fish. Significant decrease\nin the levels of (E)  esr1  and (F)  vtg3  transcripts in BPA lineage fish. Asterisks indicate statistical\nsignificances at the level of * P  < 0.05 and *** P  < 0.001 compared to control lineage by  t  test.\n\nTo examine whether ancestral\nBPA exposure altered the expression of vitellogenic genes in the F4\ngeneration liver, expression profiles of the vitellogenic genes were\ndetermined by qPCR. The mRNA levels of the sex hormone binding globulin\n( shbg ) gene, a PCOS marker, 85  were significantly decreased in the BPA lineage livers ( Figure  8 C). Furthermore,\nthe expression of genes involved in vitellogenin synthesis pathway\nin the liver was significantly altered. Mainly, the expression of\napolipoprotein ba ( apoba ) was significantly downregulated\n( Figure  8 D), and both\nestrogen receptor 1 ( esr1 ) and vitellogenin 3 ( vtg3 ) were significantly upregulated ( Figure  8 E,F) in the BPA lineage.\n\n## F4 Generation Female Fish from the BPA-Exposed\nLineage Showed Altered Morphological End Points\n\nBody mass\nindex (BMI) and gonadosomatic index (GSI) were measured to determine\nthe metabolic health of the F4 females. Compared to the control lineage,\nthe BPA lineage females had significantly increased BMI, visceral\nfat content ( Figure  1 A,B), and hepatosomatic index ( Figure  1 C). However, the GSI ( Figure  1 D) was significantly decreased, suggesting\nthat the F4 fish from the BPA lineage had a reproductive impairment.\n\nAncestral\nBPA exposure caused increased basal metabolic index (BMI),\nvisceral fat accumulation, and hepatosomatic index and reduced gonadosomatic\nindex in BPA lineage females.

(J) Degenerated follicle\n(black rectangle) with excess interstitial tissue deposition (red\narrow) found in the ovaries of BPA lineage fish. (K) Atretic follicle\nwith damaged chorion found in the ovary of BPA lineage (magnification\n×40) and follicular area.\n\n## Ancestral BPA Led to Altered Reproductive\nOutcomes in Females\n\nTo determine whether the females had\nreproductive defects, fecundity was measured, which accounts for the\nproduction of eggs per female in the BPA and control lineage. The\nmean total production of eggs per tank (fecundity) and the number\nof fertilized eggs were significantly decreased ( P  < 0.05) in the BPA lineage group compared to the control group\n( Figure 1 E,F). A 40%\ndecrease in ovary size was observed in the BPA lineage fish ( Figure  1 G) compared to the\ncontrol lineage. The number of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic follicles\nwas significantly decreased in the BPA lineage ( Figure  4 A,B) except for stage II ( Figure  1 H). Overall, a 90% decrease\nin the number of vitellogenic and postvitellogenic follicles was observed.\nMorphometric analysis of the follicular stages showed a significantly\nhigher number of stage I oocytes in the ovary of the BPA lineage fish,\nwhich decreased across stages III through stage V ( Figure  1 J). This indicated that follicular\nprogression was disrupted in the BPA lineage fish. Furthermore, the\nBPA lineage group showed damage in the chorion ( Figure  1 J) and an increased mean area of atretic\nfollicles (3.067 ± 0.6190 p 2 ,  Figure  1 J). Additionally, increased numbers of the\natretic follicles, irregular folding of the surface epithelium, degenerated\nfollicles with abnormal tissue deposition ( Figure  1 K), and hyperplasia of the granulosa cells\nwere found in the ovary, indicating a loss of follicular architecture\nin BPA lineage fish.\n\n## Global Transcriptomic Alterations and GO Analysis\nin the Ovary\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was able\nto separate 74.5% of biological replicates of both the BPA lineage\nand control lineage group into two clusters ( Figure  2 A), indicating that they are different from\neach other. The expression profiles were consistent across all three\nbiological replicates, indicating that sequencing libraries were of\nexcellent quality. In total, 2546 differentially expressed genes (DEGs),\nincluding 2094 upregulated and 452 downregulated genes, were identified\nin the BPA lineage group ( Figure  2 B), as exhibited in the volcano plot ( Figure  2 C). Global alterations in gene\nexpression in BPA lineage ovary are illustrated in a heatmap ( Figure S1 ). The GO analysis was performed to\nevaluate the functional properties of DEGs. GO results showed the\ntop 20 molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components\n( Figure S2 ). Among all biological processes,\ncellular morphogenesis, differentiation, and protein localization\nwere highly enriched by DEGs from the BPA lineage. Cellular components\nand molecular function had DEGs involved in microtubule organization,\ncellular adhesion, and cellular transport mechanism via the Golgi\napparatus. Additionally, using stricter selection criteria (fold change\n≥ 2,  p -adj ≤ 0.01), the top 10 up-\nand downregulated DEGs (biomarker) were selected from the BPA lineage\ngroup ( Figure  2 D).\nMost upregulated genes were enriched in insulin signaling pathway\n( Figure  2 E,  Figure S3 ), MAPK signaling ( Figure  2 E,  Figure S4 ), AMPK signaling pathway ( Figure  2 E,  Figure S5 ),\nand autophagy pathway ( Figure  2 E). Alternatively, downregulated genes were enriched in Rap1\n( Figure  2 F,  Figure S6 ), cAMP ( Figure  2 F,  Figure S7 ),\nand AGE-RAGE signaling pathway ( Figure  2 F,  Figure S7 ).\n\nGlobal transcriptional\nalterations in the ovary.

(D) Top 10 up- and downregulated genes in\nthe ovary of BPA lineage. KEGG pathway analysis of total upregulated\n(E) and downregulated (F) genes in the transcriptome dataset.\n\nGSEA found a positive correlation of upregulated\ngenes with autophagic mechanism ( Figure S8A ), cellular stress response ( Figure S8B ), and chromatin organization ( Figure S8C ). Downregulated DEGs were uniquely enriched with the cell signaling\npart of the biological pathway ( Figure S8D ). Additionally, DEGs were enriched with the cell cycle ( Figure S9A ), catabolic process (Figure S9FB),\nplasma membrane component ( Figure S9C ),\nmitochondria metabolic pathway ( Figure S9D ), apoptosis ( Figure S9E ), and p53 pathway\n( Figure S9F ).\n\nExpression patterns of the\ngenes that are associated with ovarian steroidogenic functions, including  amh ,  hsd17b1 ,  cyp19a1 ,  cyp11a1 ,  3 β -HSD ,\nand  cyp17 , were examined. RNA-seq results showed\na significant upregulation of  Cyp11a1 ,  amh ,  hsd17b1 ,  3 β -HSD ,  Cyp19a1  and a significant downregulation of  cyp17  in the BPA lineage group ( Figure  3 A). The expression of  igf1r  and  igfbp3  was downregulated, whereas  igf2b  expression was significantly upregulated, suggesting abnormal insulin\nsignaling in the ovary ( Figure  3 B). The expression of genes encoding collagen proteins, mainly  col1a1b ,  col1a2 , and  col12a1 , was significantly upregulated ( Figure  3 C). This suggests abnormal tissue deposition\nin the ovary of the BPA linage. In the BPA lineage, specific genes\nencoding kinases, including  mapk1 ,  mapk9 ,  mtor ,  pik3r , and  eif2ak3 , and cytokines, including  il17rd ,  il12rb1 , and  fam118b , were significantly upregulated. However,\nthe expressions of  il22ra2 ,  fam219ab , and  edn3  were significantly downregulated ( Figure  3 D,E).

However, mRNAs of  fshr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 J) and  vtgr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 K) were significantly\ndecreased in the ovary of the BPA lineage group. This indicated transgenerational\ndysregulation of steroidogenesis and reproduction-related pathways\nin the BPA lineage fish.

A significant increase in (H)  lhr  and (I)  3 β -hsd  transcripts\nwas observed in the BPA lineage ovaries. A significant decrease in\n(J)  fshr  and (K)  vtgr  transcript\nlevels was found in the BPA lineage. A significantly abundant transcript\nof (L)  caspase 3  was measured in the BPA lineage\novaries. Asterisk indicates statistical significance at the level\nof * P  < 0.05,  t  test compared\nagainst control lineage.\n\n## Alterations in the Expression of Reproductive\nGenes, Apoptosis Genes, and Genes Encoding Vitellogenin Receptors\nin the Ovary of the BPA Lineage\n\nThe mRNA levels of  lhr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 H) and  3 β -hsd  ( P  < 0.01,  Figure  3 I) were significantly increased in the ovary\nof the BPA lineage. However, mRNAs of  fshr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 J) and  vtgr  ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 K) were significantly\ndecreased in the ovary of the BPA lineage group. This indicated transgenerational\ndysregulation of steroidogenesis and reproduction-related pathways\nin the BPA lineage fish. Additionally, the levels of  caspase3  mRNAs were significantly increased ( P  < 0.05,  Figure  3 L) in the ovary of\nthe BPA lineage, suggesting increased apoptosis-mediated cell death\nin the ovary of the BPA lineage fish.\n\n## DEGs of the F4 BPA Lineage PCOS Fish Overlapped\nwith Those of the Human PCOS Patients\n\nDEGs of BPA lineage\nPCOS fish were compared with publicly available human PCOS patient\nDEGs to identify end-point specific (PCOS) DEGs associated with ancestrally\ninduced PCOS (end point) in the F4 generation. 66  In total, 292 common DEGs were found from the total of\n1374 DEGs found in the human PCOS patient data set ( Figure  4 A). Additionally, 82 DEGs were mutually upregulated in both\nBPA lineage and PCOS patients. Among the total shared DEGs in BPA\nand PCOS patient groups, 37 DEGs were mutually downregulated. However,\n173 shared DEGs showed exclusive expression patterns in the BPA lineage\n( Figure  4 A). From the\ntotal shared DEGs, the top 15 mutually upregulated (Log2FC > 2),\ndownregulated\n(Log2FC < −1), and exclusive BPA-specific DEGs are illustrated\n( Figure  4 B–D).\nHeatmaps show shared common total DEGs between BPA lineage and PCOS\npatients ( Figure S10A–D ). The comparative\nanalysis revealed that the BPA lineage ovaries have similar gene expression\npatterns to human PCOS patients. KEGG pathway analysis on 292 DEGs\nshowed significant enrichment in TNF signaling, IL signaling, growth\nhormone synthesis, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Figure  4 E). The transcriptome\ndatabase has been submitted to NCBI as  GSE226322  (token # qtqrqoycjtqfxqb).\n\nComparison\nof DEGs found in the PCOS patient data set with those\nin the ovaries of BPA lineage fish.

Canonical\npathways enriched in the molecular mechanism of cancer ( P  value 2.15E-09), autophagy ( P  value 2.95E-08),\nHOTAIR regulatory pathway ( P  value 3.00E-07), cellular\nstress and injury, cell cycle and transcriptional regulation, apoptosis,\ncytokine signaling, and immune response were determined ( Figure  5 A). DEGs were involved\nin the molecular mechanism of cancer ( Figure S11 ), autophagy ( Figure S12 ), and HOTAIR\n( Figure S13 ). Additionally, the gene-disease\nnetwork analysis showed that  akt1  and  tnf  are master regulators of various disease pathways, such as HOTAIR\nregulatory pathways, AMPK signaling, growth failure, and autophagy,\nwhich are all indicative of severe ovarian disease due to ancestral\nBPA exposure ( Figure S14 ). Using the upstream\nregulator analysis (URA) tool, IPA can identify potential upstream\nregulators by analyzing linkage to DEGs via coordinated expression. 83  A total of 94 transcription regulators were\nidentified, and the top 15 transcription regulators were determined\n( Figure S15 ). e sr1  (estrogen\nreceptor1) and  tgfb1  (transforming growth factor\nbeta 1) were the most significant upstream regulators interacting\nwith several genes such as  jun ,  myc ,  foxo3 ,  smad3 , and  e2f1  ( Figure  5 B,C).\n\nIPA analysis\non the DEGs in the BPA lineage ovaries.

An orthogonal\npartial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was performed\nto elucidate the differences between the BPA and the control lineage\ngroup. According to the score plot, there was a difference among the\ngroups ( Figure S16 ). In this OPLS-DA model,\nR2X = 0.29, R2Y = 0.91, Q2 = 0.5. Metabolites with VIP > 1 are\nshown\nin  Figure S17  with  m / z , retention time, and HMDB class and IDs. The clustered\nheatmap showed the top 50 significant metabolites and their relative\nabundance ( Figure  6 A), providing useful insights into the relationship between unique\nmetabolites of the BPA lineage and control lineage. The metabolites\nbelonged to amino acids, purine and pyrimidine derivatives, organic\nacids, lipid molecules, sugars, and some other class of molecules.\nLipid molecules such as glucosylceramide; PS (16:0/16:0); amino acids\nmainly  l -histidine, allysine,  l -tryptophan, and  l -valine; and purine derivatives mainly guanosine, xanthine,\nhypoxanthine, and guanine were found in higher abundance in BPA lineage\ngroup. 4,6-Dihydroxyquinoline, vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide, uracil, phosphocreatine,\ncytosine, and  l -aspartic acid were detected but in low abundance.\nDifferential abundance of amino acids from the ovary of the BPA lineage\nfish was mapped in metabolic pathways associated with PCOS ( Figure  6 B). Biomarkers of\nPCOS were found in the ovary metabolite data. With  P  < 0.05 and AUC = 1, a total of 17 biomarkers were found in the\novary of the BPA lineage ( Figure  6 C). Those were inosine, guanosine, phosphocreatine,\n2-methylcitric acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene,  l -palmitoylcarnitine, xanthine, niacinamide, asymmetric dimethylarginine,\nall- trans -retinoic acid, hypoxanthine, nicotinic\nacid, ornithine, 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1D-myo-inositol, glucosylceramide,\nand allysine ( Figure S17 ). The top 25 highly\nenriched metabolic pathways were identified. Metabolically important\npathways such as arginine biosynthesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis,\nhistidine metabolism, proline metabolism, and glutathione metabolism\nwere highly enriched in the BPA lineage ovary ( Figure S18 ).\n\nGlobal metabolic alterations in the ovary of BPA lineage\nfish.\n(A) Heatmap showing a differential abundance of the top 50 significant\nmetabolites. (B) The abundance profile of amino acids in the PCOS\nmetabolic pathway. (C) Table of biomarkers and the list of ovarian\nmetabolites.\n\nTo investigate potential metabolites linked to transgenerational\nPCOS, the metabolites of F4 ovary from BPA lineage were compared with\nthe PCOS patient metabolite data. 81  A total\nof 16 metabolites were found to be common between BPA lineage and\nPCOS patients ( Figure  7 A). Among the 16 metabolites, 8 common metabolites showed a mutual\npattern of abundance, and 7 of them showed an exclusive abundance\npattern in the ovary of BPA lineage. Pregnenolone, eicosapentaenoic\nacid, phytosphingosine, azelaic acid, sphinganine, phenylpyruvic acid,\nornithine, and inosine showed similar abundance patterns in the ovary\nof BPA lineage and PCOS patient data set ( Figure  6 A). However, creatinine, taurine, uridine,\nand taurine exhibited an exclusive pattern of abundance under common\nmetabolites ( Figure  6 A). KEGG pathway analysis was conducted on common metabolites found\nin the ovary of BPA lineage and human patients. These pathways included\nsphingolipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine\nand tryptophan metabolism, taurine metabolism, and hypotaurine metabolism\n( Figure S18 ).\n\nComparison of metabolites\nbetween the PCOS patient data set and\nthe ovary of BPA lineage fish.

(B) Joint pathway analysis of transcriptome and metabolomes\nwith list of the pathways with total hits,  P  value,\nand FDR.\n\nSignificantly altered metabolites and genes\nwere submitted to joint pathway analysis in Metaboanalyst. 84  Out of the 324 biological processes identified,\n74 pathways had  P  value < 0.05 and FDR < 25%.\nThe top three pathways based on the calculation of  P  value were the ABC transporter, carbon metabolism in cancer, and\narginine biosynthesis ( Figure  7 B). The gene–metabolite interaction network and metabolite–metabolite\ninteraction network are shown in  Figure S19 . Metabolites found in carbon metabolism for triggering cancer were\nmapped in  Figure S20 . The insulin signaling,\nendocytosis, and cancer-related pathways that were found prominent\nin both omics were also significantly enriched in the integrative\nanalysis.\n\n## Comparative Analysis of the Metabolites\nof BPA Lineage Fish Ovary with PCOS Patient Metabolite Data Set\n\nTo investigate potential metabolites linked to transgenerational\nPCOS, the metabolites of F4 ovary from BPA lineage were compared with\nthe PCOS patient metabolite data. 81  A total\nof 16 metabolites were found to be common between BPA lineage and\nPCOS patients ( Figure  7 A). Among the 16 metabolites, 8 common metabolites showed a mutual\npattern of abundance, and 7 of them showed an exclusive abundance\npattern in the ovary of BPA lineage. Pregnenolone, eicosapentaenoic\nacid, phytosphingosine, azelaic acid, sphinganine, phenylpyruvic acid,\nornithine, and inosine showed similar abundance patterns in the ovary\nof BPA lineage and PCOS patient data set ( Figure  6 A). However, creatinine, taurine, uridine,\nand taurine exhibited an exclusive pattern of abundance under common\nmetabolites ( Figure  6 A). KEGG pathway analysis was conducted on common metabolites found\nin the ovary of BPA lineage and human patients. These pathways included\nsphingolipid metabolism, glutathione metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine\nand tryptophan metabolism, taurine metabolism, and hypotaurine metabolism\n( Figure S18 ).\n\nComparison of metabolites\nbetween the PCOS patient data set and\nthe ovary of BPA lineage fish.

(B) Joint pathway analysis of transcriptome and metabolomes\nwith list of the pathways with total hits,  P  value,\nand FDR.\n\n## Integrated Metabolomic and Transcriptomic\nPathway Analysis Revealed Deleterious Pathways in the Ovary of BPA\nLineage Fish\n\nSignificantly altered metabolites and genes\nwere submitted to joint pathway analysis in Metaboanalyst. 84  Out of the 324 biological processes identified,\n74 pathways had  P  value < 0.05 and FDR < 25%.\nThe top three pathways based on the calculation of  P  value were the ABC transporter, carbon metabolism in cancer, and\narginine biosynthesis ( Figure  7 B). The gene–metabolite interaction network and metabolite–metabolite\ninteraction network are shown in  Figure S19 . Metabolites found in carbon metabolism for triggering cancer were\nmapped in  Figure S20 . The insulin signaling,\nendocytosis, and cancer-related pathways that were found prominent\nin both omics were also significantly enriched in the integrative\nanalysis.\n\n## Abnormal Fat Accumulation and Hepatosteatosis\nin the Liver of the F4 Females\n\nThe liver in the BPA lineage\nfemales had more vacuolated hepatocytes than in the control lineage\nfish ( Figure  8 A). The\nhepatic cells were arranged in sheets separated by sinusoidal meshes.\nTo determine if ancestral BPA exposure caused lipid accumulation in\nthe liver, which is also a symptom of NAFLD, Oil Red O was used to\nstain hepatic neutral lipids. Consistent with their higher hepatosomatic\nindex (HSI), cryosections of the livers of the BPA lineage females\nshowed a proportional accumulation of neutral lipids ( Figure  8 B), indicating the liver of\nBPA lineage developing NAFLD.\n\nAncestral BPA exposure resulted in liver steatosis\nin females of\nthe F4 generation. (A) Liver histology micrograph. (B) Fat accumulation\nin the liver of the F4 generation females (magnification ×40).\nTransgenerational alterations in the expression of genes in BPA lineage\nlivers. Significant decrease in (C)  shbg  and (D)  apoba  transcript in BPA lineage fish. Significant decrease\nin the levels of (E)  esr1  and (F)  vtg3  transcripts in BPA lineage fish. Asterisks indicate statistical\nsignificances at the level of * P  < 0.05 and *** P  < 0.001 compared to control lineage by  t  test.\n\n## Expression of Vitellogenic and Sex Hormone\nBinding Globulin Genes in the Liver\n\nTo examine whether ancestral\nBPA exposure altered the expression of vitellogenic genes in the F4\ngeneration liver, expression profiles of the vitellogenic genes were\ndetermined by qPCR. The mRNA levels of the sex hormone binding globulin\n( shbg ) gene, a PCOS marker, 85  were significantly decreased in the BPA lineage livers ( Figure  8 C). Furthermore,\nthe expression of genes involved in vitellogenin synthesis pathway\nin the liver was significantly altered. Mainly, the expression of\napolipoprotein ba ( apoba ) was significantly downregulated\n( Figure  8 D), and both\nestrogen receptor 1 ( esr1 ) and vitellogenin 3 ( vtg3 ) were significantly upregulated ( Figure  8 E,F) in the BPA lineage.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAccording to familial clustering\nand twin studies, PCOS is an inherited\ndisease. 86 , 87  Given that approximately 10% of its human\nPCOS loci are genetic and inherited, 88  the\noverall pathogenesis of PCOS suggests its onset and regulation by\nenvironmental and nongenetic mechanisms. Environmental chemical exposures\nduring germ cell reprogramming can leave chemical-specific epigenetic\nmarks on germ cells, which result in phenotypic abnormalities that\npersist through several generations. 89 − 91  When directly exposed\nto BPA, females develop metabolic disorders or PCOS in the immediate\ngeneration (F0). 92 − 95  However, it is not clearly understood whether future-generation\nfemales can still suffer metabolic and reproductive diseases even\nafter the withdrawal of BPA from consumer products and the environment.\nThis study demonstrates for the first time using medaka fish as an\nanimal model that embryonic exposure to BPA during germ cell reprogramming\nin a grandparental generation leads to multidisease transgenerational\nphenotypes, PCOS, and NAFLD in the fifth generation who did not experience\nBPA exposure. The hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad (HPG)\naxis in fish resembles that in mammals, suggesting a great potential\nto study human PCOS as an alternative nonmammalian model. 36 , 37 , 40  Medaka and zebrafish utilize\nsimilar pathways of sex hormonal regulation of steroidogenesis but\nprocess epigenome in their embryo and germline cells differently. 39  Unlike other fish species, medaka processes\nepigenetic information in postfertilization embryos and primordial\ngerm cells similar to humans and mice, making them excellent transgenerational\nmodels. 38 , 39  This suggests that the mechanistic molecular\ninformation obtained from medaka could be valuable for understanding\nancestral epigenetic effects of BPA in the development of PCOS in\nthe subsequent generation of other higher vertebrates, including humans.\n\nIn the present study, F4 females of the BPA lineage group displayed\nabnormal metabolic traits, such as increased BMI and visceral fat\naccumulation. The ability of BPA to induce fat accumulation has been\ndemonstrated in a direct exposure model. BPA caused insulin resistance\nand disrupted lipid homeostasis in primary human preadipocytes, resulting\nin abnormal fat accumulation  in vitro , 96 − 100  suggesting BPA’s ability to modulate fat deposition due to\nchronic exposure. However, how visceral fat deposition occurs in unexposed\ngenerations due to ancestral exposure is unclear. In addition to transgenerational\nfat deposition in the BPA lineage group, significant upregulation\nof the expression of  il6  and genes encoding several\ncytokines and downregulation of  igf1  were found in\nthe ovary of the BPA lineage, indicating a potential state of insulin\nresistance mediated by visceral fat accumulation. Congruent with a\nprevious study, an altered expression pattern, particularly the upregulation\nof  il6  and activation of  tnf- α,\na master regulator, was found in the ovary of BPA lineage, indicating\nvisceral fat mediation due to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines\n( TNF- α,  IL-6 ) and tissue macrophages,\ncritical drivers of PCOS-obesity multifactorial disease. 101 , 102  The downregulation of  igf1  in the ovary of the\nBPA lineage could also have contributed to impaired follicular growth,\nas reflected histologically. The literature shows decreased levels\nof IGF-I and IGF-II proteins in the follicular fluid of PCOS women\nas well as reduced expression of IGF-1 receptor in human granulosa\ncells, 103 , 104  suggesting the role of IGF protein in PCOS\ndevelopment. The present observations provide an additional line of\ninformation that environmentally induced transgenerational fat deposition\ncould have activated cytokines and decreased follicular maturation\nin females of the BPA lineage, leading to PCOS phenotype.\n\nThe\ngonadotropins play a vital role in PCOS pathogenesis, and in\nthe teleost, they regulate the vitellogenesis and final oocyte maturation/ovulation. 105 , 106  In the present study, lower levels of  fshr  mRNA\nand higher levels of  lhr  mRNA were detected in the\novary of BPA lineage fish than in the control. In teleost, gonadotropin\nreceptor expression positively correlates with plasma hormone levels. 107  The present results indicated lower levels\nof mRNAs for FSH and higher levels of LH in the ovary of BPA lineage\nfish, suggesting transgenerational hormonal imbalance. A high LH/FSH\nratio is a characteristic of PCOS patients. Similar patterns of gonadotropin\nreceptor gene expression suggest a similar trend. 108  Increased levels of plasma FSH and ovarian follicle-stimulating\nhormone receptor ( FSHr ) mRNA levels are required\nfor the transition of oocytes from the previtellogenic stage (stage\nII) to vitellogenic stages (stage III) during ovarian maturation. 106 , 109 , 110  In the present study, abnormal\nfollicular development in stage II (previtellogenic oocyte) was found,\nalong with the downregulation of  fshr  in the ovary\nof BPA lineage. Ovarian follicles are arrested at the primary growth-previtellogenic\ntransition in zebrafish mutant for  fshr. ( 111 ) The restricted maturation of follicles observed\nin the ovary of BPA lineage medaka that leads to anovulation could\nbe due to deficiency of  fshr , which is a primary\nphenotype for PCOS. 112  Consistent with\nour present histopathological findings in medaka, similar histological\nphenotypes were found in the rat model of PCOS, suggesting that the\nBPA lineage group had developed PCOS phenotype in the ovary. 113  Direct exposure to BPA has been linked to follicular\narrest and atresia leading to anovulation, 114 − 116  suggesting that transgenerational PCOS could be driven by mechanisms\nsimilar to those reported from direct exposure studies. The critical\nyet undiscovered information is delineating heritable molecular determinants\nof PCOS and developing strategies to block pathways to disease, as\nenvironmental BPA exposure (past and present) might already have left\nsuch molecular memories in the germline of the existing population.\n\nThe development of PCOS is intrinsically linked to steroidogenic\ndysregulation. The upregulation of androgenic genes such as  3 β -hsd ,  hsd17b1 ,\nand  cyp11a  in the ovary of BPA lineage medaka could\nhave potentially enhanced testosterone biosynthesis in ovarian theca\ncells. This can be validated by a human study in which a positive\nassociation of increased free testosterone (hyperandrogenemia) was\nfound with increased visceral fat deposits in women with PCOS. 117  This clearly suggests that transgenerational\ndeposition of visceral fat could be due to the biosynthesis of testosterone\nin BPA lineage females. In contrast, the expression of C yp19a1a , the gene encoding estrogen-synthesizing enzyme aromatase, was increased\nin the ovary of the BPA lineage females. The fold change of androgenic\ngenes was more significant than that of estrogen-synthesizing genes,\nindicating an increase in the hypothetical ratio of androgen/estrogen,\na characteristic of PCOS. 118  An  in vitro  study found that hyperactivation of  lhr  increases adenylate cyclase, which triggers the synthesis of  3 β -hsd. 119 , 120  Increased levels of LH boost the synthesis of androgen from theca\ncells of the ovary leading to ovarian dysfunction. 121 , 122  Congruent with our observation, the upregulation of  lhr  expression could have induced the upregulation of  3 β -hsd , enhancing androgen synthesis in the\novary. As a result, dysregulation of the steroidogenic pathway could\nhave contributed to potential reproductive impairment related to the\nPCOS phenotype in the F4 BPA lineage fish.\n\nPCOS-specific DEGs\nactivated in the ovary of BPA lineage fish were\ncompared with the PCOS patient transcriptome data set. In total, 292\ncommon significant DEGs were determined, potentially contributing\nto pathogenesis, including genes associated with activating the TNF\nsignaling pathway, endocrine resistance, and cancer pathway. Consistent\nwith GSEA analysis, IPA revealed canonical pathways such as autophagic\nmechanism, cell cycle regulation, cellular stress and injury, and\ncancer pathway with the activation of AKT1 and TNF. Interestingly,\ngenes associated with activating the cancerous pathway, i.e.,  myc ,  akt1 ,  apc , and  mtor , were upregulated in the ovary of the BPA lineage group.\nAlternatively, the ovary of the BPA lineage group showed decreased\nexpression of  foxo1  and tumor suppressor gene ( smad 4 ) genes. Upregulation of c-MYC, enhanced AKT activity,\nactivated protein C (APC), and reduced FOXO3a activity were observed\nin epithelial ovarian carcinoma. 123 − 126  In line with a previous study\nconducted by Bornstein  et al.  showing that a loss\nin SMAD4 increases genomic instability associated with the TGF-β\nsignaling in ovarian cancer, increased expression of  tgf- β in the ovary of BPA lineage was detected, suggesting an advanced\nstage of ovarian disease. 127  Among the\ntop 10 upregulated genes, three genes, namely,  selenop ,  RNA-nf1 , and  olfml3 , were associated\nwith sex-hormone modulation 128  and found\nin PCOS follicular fluid, 129  controlling\ncell cycle progression associated with ovarian teratoma. 130  In the top 10 downregulated genes,  fabp6  and  arl6  (ADP ribosylation factor\nlike GTPase6) were involved in ovarian disease 131  and modulating membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal function. 132  As transcriptional dysregulation and diseases\nare influenced by chromatin organization, 133  we were interested in deciphering epigenetic gene expression controlling\nthe transcriptional output of the cell. Among the 91 DEGs found to\nbe involved in chromatin organization,  kdm2b ,  ehmt1 ,  hdac4 ,  kmt2d ,  jmjd6 ,  ctcf ,  setd5 ,  suz12 ,  btaf1 , and  bahd1  were all upregulated, whereas  dnmt3ba  and  dnmt3b  were downregulated, indicating transgenerational\nalteration of epigenetic genes associated with PCOS phenotype in the\novary of BPA lineage. Previous studies showed that upregulation of\nKDM2B and HDAC and dysregulation of EHMT1/2 are linked to DNA damage\nand dysregulation of the cell cycle, and overexpression of  HDAC  is linked to ovarian cancer. 134 , 135  Together with the published literature, differential expression\nof PCOS-specific genes and epigenetic genes linked to histone modifications\nand DNA methylation indicates a role of epigenetic genes associated\nwith PCOS phenotype in the ovary of BPA lineage fish.\n\nIn the\novary of the BPA lineage fish, several transforming growth\nfactors (TGFs) were differentially expressed, indicating activation\nof several downstream genes such as fibrotic genes such as  col1a1b ,  cola2 ,  col2a1a ,  jun ,  foxo3 ,  sp1 , and  olfml3  and extracellular matrix protein genes.\nIn addition, the expressions of  hspa5  and  eif2ak3  (unfolded protein response (UPR) genes) were upregulated\nin the BPA lineage ovary compared to control, indicating that ER stress\nresponse could have potentially activated the TGF β pathway. 136  The ovary of the BPA lineage fish showed significant\nupregulation of several transforming growth factors, including upstream\nregulators  tgfb1  and  tgfb3 , indicating\nthe activation of several downstream fibrotic genes such as  col1a1b ,  cola2 ,  col2a1a ,  jun ,  foxo3 , and  sp1 . The ovary of the BPA lineage fish also showed extracellular tissue\ndeposition in accordance with the activation of fibrotic genes and\nextracellular matrix protein gene  olfml3 . Expression\nof genes related to ER stress, UPR, and TGF-1 was upregulated in granulosa\ncells of the ovary and was linked to tissue fibrosis. 137 − 140  Extracellular matrix accumulation in the form of collagen deposition\nin the ovarian capsule of the BPA lineage is linked to PCOS pathogenesis. 141  Using GSEA analysis, 94 DEGS were identified\nas associated with autophagy, including upregulated  atg3 ,  becn2 , and  casp3  and downregulated\nfoxo1 genes, suggesting aberrant autophagic mechanism activated in\nthe ovary of the BPA lineage. The literature suggests that ATG3 and\nFoxo1 levels are downregulated in PCOS patients and that decreased\nlevels of autophagy markers (ATG7 and BECN1) directly inhibit oocyte\nmaturation. 142 , 143  Moreover, an elevated  caspase3  expression in the ovary, which is a biomarker for\nPCOS, can trigger aberrant apoptosis resulting in the development\nof cysts resulting from degenerated follicles found in the ovary of\nthe BPA lineage. 144  Direct exposure to\nBPA has been found to activate proinflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNFα\nthat are involved in fibrosis. 145  However,\nin transgenerational PCOS ovaries, activation of the TGF signaling\npathway and ER stress response was synergistically involved in fibrosis\ninduced by ancestral BPA exposure.\n\nCompared with the previous\nmetabolomic studies on follicular fluid\nfrom PCOS patients, the changes in several metabolites in the ovary\nof BPA lineage were consistent with PCOS patients. 81  Mutual metabolites were significantly enriched in sphingolipid\nmetabolism, glutathione metabolism, taurine, hypotaurine metabolism,\nand phenylalanine metabolism. An abnormal expression of sphingolipids\nsuch as lysophosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines was\nfound to be associated with PCOS. 82  Physiological\ndeviations in amino acid concentrations may lead to pathogenic conditions,\nsuch as oxidative stress and ovarian disease, as well as metabolic\ndisturbances, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and insulin resistance. 146 − 148  A high abundance of valine, histidine, tryptophan, and creatinine\nwas found in the BPA lineage group. In agreement with our finding,\nan analysis performed by Zhao  et al.  found that the\nlevels of alanine, valine, serine, threonine, ornithine, phenylalanine,\ntyrosine, and tryptophan are generally increased and the levels of\nglycine and proline are reduced in plasma samples of PCOS patients. 82  In the present study, PCOS-specific pathways,\nincluding arginine biosynthesis, 149 , 150  aminoacyl-tRNA\nbiosynthesis, 151 , 152  beta-alanine metabolism, 150  proline and arginine metabolism, 153 , 154  taurine metabolism, 155  and phenylalanine\nmetabolism, 150  were activated in the ovary\nof the BPA lineage group, suggesting that metabolic alterations were\npromoted by ancestral BPA exposure effect.\n\nThe present results\nfrom a human–fish comparative metabolomics–transcriptome\nanalysis show distinctly altered ABC transporter, central carbon metabolism\nin cancer, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, protein digestion, and absorption\npathways, indicating that BPA has a potential role in the development\nof PCOS in fish and humans. Changes in the ATP binding cassette transporter\n1 (ABC1) gene, which encodes the protein regulating entry and exit\nfrom the cell membrane, may contribute to dyslipidemia in patients\nwith PCOS. 156 , 157  In addition, the top five significantly\nenriched KEGG pathways for PCOS vs premature ovarian follicle (POF)\ngroup metabolites included protein digestion and absorption pathways,\nABC transporter-dependent pathways, central carbon metabolism pathways\nin cancer, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway, and prostate cancer\npathways found in human studies. 158  Additionally,\narginine proline metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, and lysosomal\npathways were found to be involved in ancestral BPA exposure-induced\nPCOS. A KEGG pathway analysis indicated that insulin signaling, MAPK\nsignaling, AMPK signaling pathway, and autophagic pathway were enriched\nby total upregulated genes, whereas Rap1, cAMP, and AGE-RAGE signaling\npathways were enriched by total downregulated genes, indicating PCOS-specific\npathways in the ovary of the BPA lineage. Activation of the Rap1 signaling\npathway is found in cancer, and AGE-RAGE signaling is involved in\nthe pathogenesis of diabetes. 159 , 160  Several studies have\nshown that PCOS is associated with impaired insulin signaling, aberrant\nMAPK signaling, and abnormal AMPK signaling in ovarian cumulus and\ngranulosa cells. 66 , 161 , 162  The present results, together with the published literature on PCOS\ndevelopment and progression, show that ancestral BPA exposure seems\nto have activated deleterious signaling pathways in the ovary of the\nBPA lineage leading to advanced-stage ovarian disease. The PCOS phenotype\nwas observed in females that developed severe NALFD.\n\nThe presence\nof low  apoB  transcript in the liver\nof BPA lineage females was accompanied by significant fat accumulation,\nsuggesting that a lack of fat molecules released by the liver may\nhave contributed to abnormal fat accumulation, as indicated by the\noil and red stain in the liver. Downregulation of  apoB  isoforms may result in low levels of TGs and cholesterol in the\ncirculation as well as an extensive accumulation of lipid droplets\nin hepatocytes, indicating the development of NAFLD phenotype. 163  In BPA lineage females, the levels of  shbg  mRNAs were significantly decreased in the liver, suggesting\nanother possible link between transgenerational PCOS and NAFLD. The\nPCOS biomarker SHBG protein is a circulating homodimeric glycoprotein\nsynthesized by hepatocytes with a stronger affinity for testosterone\nthan estrogen. 164  The expression of  shbg  was decreased in the liver of the BPA lineage females.\nSuch a decrease in expression has been found to positively correlate\nwith the bioavailability of free testosterone, 165  hyperandrogenism, 166  fatty liver\ndisease, hyperinsulinemia, and PCOS. These observations reflect a\ncross talk between the hepato-ovarian axis in BPA lineage fish. Additionally,\nthe F4 generation of the BPA lineage group showed highly upregulated  esr1  and  vtg3  transcripts in the liver,\nindicating estrogen-mediated induction of vitellogenin synthesis that\nenhances fat body synthesis in the liver. 167  However, the uptake of vitellogenin via the vitellogenin receptor\nin the ovary is highly important for the maturation of oocytes in\nteleost to maintain a steady state of follicular balance. 168  In the BPA lineage fish, vitellogenin receptor\n( vtgr ) expression was significantly reduced, suggesting\na perturbed vitellogenin uptake that could have prevented the transition\nfrom previtellogenic to vitellogenic oocytes and promoted the immature\nfollicular state related to the PCOS phenotype in the BPA lineage\nfish.\n\nThe present results demonstrate a multidisease phenotype\nof NAFLD–PCOS\nin females four generations after direct embryonic BPA exposure at\nF0 generation. At this time of embryonic development, the liver and\ngonadal germline cells are differentiating from their progenitor cells.\nResults suggest that BPA exposure not only causes PCOS in an immediate\ngeneration but also can cause multidisease phenotype in offspring\nafter several generations, via germline transmission. Integration\nof both transcriptomic and metabolomic results revealed the presence\nof affected metabolic routes in the ovary of the BPA lineage, suggesting\na potential mechanism underlying transgenerational reproductive impairment.\nTogether with the transgenerational inheritance concept of the published\nliterature, the present study suggests that ancestral BPA exposure-induced\nmolecular memories, not yet discovered, may be promoting these multidisease\nphenotypes. Environmentally established molecular memories are transferred\nfrom the germline to the somatic cells (e.g., liver and ovary). 7  To demonstrate causative relationships between\ngermline epigenome and observed transgenerational phenotypic traits\nin the ovary and liver, it is imperative to screen the ancestral germline\nepimutations induced by BPA and correlate them with epigenomes of\nliver and ovary of subsequent generations and their manipulation by\nCRISPR-mediated epigenome editing to understand their role in the\ndevelopment of multidisease phenotypes.",
