  "abstract": "Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a synthetic perfluorinated\nchemical\nclassified as a persistent organic pollutant. PFOA has been linked\nto many toxic effects, including liver injury. Many studies report\nthat PFOA exposure alters serum and hepatic lipid metabolism. However,\nlipidomic pathways altered by PFOA exposure are largely unknown and\nonly a few lipid classes, mostly triacylglycerol (TG), are usually\nconsidered in lipid analysis. Here, we performed a global lipidomic\nanalysis on the liver of PFOA-exposed (high-dose and short-duration)\nand control mice by combining three mass spectrometry (MS) techniques:\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS),\nmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging\n(MALDI-MSI), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).\nAmong all hepatic lipids identified by LC–MS/MS analysis, more\nthan 350 were statistically impacted (increased or decreased levels)\nafter PFOA exposure, as confirmed by multi-variate data analysis.\nThe levels of many lipid species from different lipid classes, most\nnotably phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and\nTG, were significantly altered. Subsequent lipidomic analysis highlights\nthe pathways significantly impacted by PFOA exposure, with the glycerophospholipid\nmetabolism being the most impacted, and the changes in the lipidome\nnetwork, which connects all the lipid species together. MALDI-MSI\ndisplays the heterogeneous distribution of the affected lipids and\nPFOA, revealing different areas of lipid expression linked to PFOA\nlocalization. TOF-SIMS localizes PFOA at the cellular level, supporting\nMALDI-MSI results. This multi-modal MS analysis unveils the lipidomic\nimpact of PFOA in the mouse liver after high-dose and short-term exposure\nand opens new opportunities in toxicology.",

      "text": "Chemicals and solvents (analytical grade)\nwere purchased from the following sources: gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich,\nUSA), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1,5-diaminonaphthalene\n97% (DAN) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), acetonitrile (ACN) (Honeywell,\nGermany), chloroform (Acros Organics, Belgium), and methanol (Carl\nRoth, Germany). All chemicals were stored, handled, and disposed of\naccording to good laboratory practices (GLP).\n\nIn this study, we used 8-week-old\nmale C57BL/6NRj mice (Janvier Labs, France). They were kept in an\nanimal facility under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions at a\nconstant temperature (21 ± 2 °C) with a day/night cycle\nof 12 h and had free access to water and food (Harlan Teklad 2018,\nEnvigo, USA). All mice were acclimated to standard housing for 7 days.\nThe experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the local\nethics committee of Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées (APAFIS#21271)\nin accordance with European directive 2010/63/EU.\n\nFor the study,\nsix mice were divided into two groups (three animals/group), receiving\ntap water (control vehicle) or PFOA (prepared in tap water) daily\nby oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day for 3 days.\nThe health status of the animals was monitored daily, and no change\nin mouse weight was observed. After 3 days of exposure, mice were\nsacrificed by cervical dislocation. The liver weight was doubled after\nacute exposure compared to control animals, with less red steatosis-like\ncolor. Liver samples were then collected for downstream analysis with\none piece for LC–MS/MS and one piece for MSI per animal.\n\nFor LC–MS/MS analysis, samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen\nand then stored at −80 °C, whereas samples for MSI analysis\nwere embedded in a warm (37 °C) aliquot of gelatin (10% w/v)\nand CMC (2.5% w/v), frozen in isopentane previously cooled down to\n−160 °C in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80\n°C.\n\nLiver samples from\nPFOA-exposed and control mice (three animals per group) were analyzed.\nMouse livers were weighted, transferred in plastic tubes, and homogenized\nin cold methanol (4 mL/g tissue) and deionized water (0.85 mL/g tissue)\nby bead beating in the Mixer Mill MM 400 (Retsch, Germany) with 0.1-mm\ndiameter zirconium beads at 30 Hz for 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting\nlysates were vortexed, transferred into glass vials, submerged with\ncold dichloromethane (2 mL/g tissue) and deionized water (2 mL/g tissue),\nand vortexed again. 10 μL EquiSPLASH Internal Standard (Avanti\nPolar lipids, USA) was added in each sample. The vials were vortexed,\nkept on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for\n15 min at 4 °C, resulting in two phases separated by proteins\nand cellular debris. The lower dichloromethane phases (with lipophilic\ncompounds) were carefully transferred using a Pasteur pipette into\nglass LC vials. The solvent was removed using the Refrigerated CentriVap\nVacuum Concentrator (Labconco, USA) at 4 °C, and the samples\nwere resuspended in 200 μL methanol and stored at −80\n°C until LC–MS/MS analysis. That lipid extraction procedure\nwas adapted from Beckonert and colleagues. 34\n\nLC–MS/MS analysis\nis performed using a Thermo Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled with\na Thermo linear trap quadrupole (LTQ)/orbitrap elite high-resolution\nmass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA), with the sample\nrack and the column at 40 °C. Mobile phases used for the separation\nare  A:  ACN/water (40:60) containing 10 mM ammonium acetate\nand  B:  ACN/isopropanol (10:90) containing 10 mM ammonium\nacetate). HPLC was performed with a gradient elution over 40 min,\n0–30 min:  A  70%  B  30% →  A  0.5%  B  99.5%, 30–40 min:  B  99.5%, flowrate: 0.4 mL/min, injection volume: 5 μL, column:\nKinetex C18 (250 × 4.6 mm 2 , 5 μm). TOP 3 DDA\nLC–MS/MS was performed using a 3 Da isolation window, with\nHCD45 fragmentation in separate runs, and full-scans over  m/z  350–1600, in positive and negative ion mode (four\nruns per sample in total).\n\nLC–MS/MS data were analyzed using MS–Data Independent\nAnaLysis (MS-dial) software for lipid annotation. 35  Peak assignation was performed by examining tandem mass\nspectra for diagnostic ion fragments along with associated chain fragment\ninformation. Moreover, the isotopic profile, ion chromatogram, mass\nerror of measured precursor, and fragment ions were examined to support\nidentification. Data were also analyzed using Metabolomic Pathway\nAnalysis (MetaboAnalyst,  https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/ ) platform for pathway enrichment\nanalysis 36 , 37  and Lipid Network Explorer (LINEX,  https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/linex/ ) platform for lipid network analysis. 38 , 39  Multi-variate\nanalyses, namely principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least\nsquares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were performed using MetaboAnalyst\non identified species. Data were normalized row-wise (normalization\nto constant sum) and column-wise (Pareto Scaling). Data were analyzed\nby one-way ANOVA using Graphpad Prism software (GraphPad Software\nInc., USA). All results are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Differences\nbetween groups were considered statistically significant when the  p -value < 0.05.\n\nLiver samples from PFOA-exposed\nand control mice (two animals per group) were analyzed considering\ntwo sections per sample. Cryo-fixed livers were cut into 10-μm\nsections and deposited on silicon wafer (Siltronix, France). Sections\nwere kept at −80 °C. Prior to analysis, they were dried\nin a vacuum desiccator for 30 min. Optical images of the tissue sections\nwere taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Belgium). For\nMALDI analysis, sections were coated with a DAN matrix (10 mg/mL in\n70% v/v ACN) using a HTX TM sprayer (HTX Technologies LLC, USA). The\nfollowing parameters were applied: temperature 30 °C, flow rate\n0.12 mL/min, velocity 1200 mm/min, drying time 2 s, line spacing 2.5\nmm, pressure 10 psi, nozzle height 40 mm, and eight layers.\n\nThe TOF-SIMS analysis was\nperformed on a TOF-SIMS V (ION-TOF GmbH, Germany) instrument. Mass\nspectra acquisition and imaging experiments, presented hereafter,\nwere carried out with a 25 keV pulsed Bi 3 +  cluster\nion source, delivering a 0.14 pA target current. The specific “burst\nalignment delay extraction” (BADE) mode, with a dose of 1 ×\n10 12  Bi 3 +  ions/cm 2 , provides\na good compromise between lateral resolution (submicron) and mass\nresolution (5000 at  m/z  281). 40  The analyzed area was 500 × 500 μm 2  with a raster size of 1024 by 1024 pixels. Data were obtained in\nboth negative and positive modes, and the secondary ion mass spectra\nwere calibrated using C n –  carbon clusters and C x H y +  species, respectively.\n\nMALDI analysis on liver\nsections was performed as previously described 41  using an atmospheric pressure (AP)-MALDI ultra-high-resolution\n(UHR) ion source (Masstech Inc., USA) coupled with a LTQ-orbitrap\nelite high-resolution mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific,\nUSA) in positive and negative ion modes. For imaging, the AP-MALDI\nsource was operated in a “constant speed raster” motion\nmode with a stage stepping size of 20 μm. The laser energy was\n2000 Hz, and spot size was <20 μm. 41  Spectrum acquisition: 500 ms maximum injection time; mass range:\n350–1600 Da; and mass resolution: 120 k at  m/z  400.\n\nTOF-SIMS data\nanalysis was performed using SurfaceLab 7 (IONTOF GmbH, Germany).\nMALDI-MSI data were analyzed using Thermo Xcalibur 2.2 and Thermo\nImageQuest (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA), METASPACE ( https://metaspace2020.eu ), and\nLipostarMSI (Molecular Horizons Srl, Italy). All images were normalized\nto total ion count (TIC) and denoised by hotspot removal. Segmentation\n(bisecting K-means algorithm), colocalization, and PCA analyses were\nperformed using LipostarMSI."

      "text": "PFOA was clearly\nidentified in PFOA-exposed liver samples (“case”) using\nLC–MS/MS analysis after 1.45 min ( Figure  1 a) at  m/z  412.966 ( Figure  1 b) and confirmed\nby MS 2  spectrum ( Figure  1 c). The experimental isotope pattern of PFOA is consistent\nwith the theoretical one ( Figure S1 ), and\nthe MS 2  spectrum is in line with the literature. 42  Due to its omnipresence in the environment (and\nparticularly in the water), we also detected it in the control liver\nand even in the blank. The PFOA signal intensity was two orders of\nmagnitude lower in the control liver than in the case and two orders\nof magnitude lower in the blank than in the control ( Figure S2 ). The analytical reproducibility and the biological\nvariability were assessed by normalization with internal standards\n( Figure S3 ).\n\nPFOA identification and\nlocalization in the PFOA-exposed liver\nfor one representative animal by LC–MS/MS and MALDI-MSI: (a)\nliquid chromatogram (LC) at 1.45 min, (b) MS spectrum at  m/z  412.966, (c) MS/MS spectrum, and (d) MALDI-MSI image of PFOA (sum\nof [C 8 F 15 O 2 ] −  and\n[C 7 F 15 ] − ).\n\nPFOA was also successfully localized inside the\nliver using MALDI-MSI\n( Figure  1 d) and TOF-SIMS\n( Figure S4 ) techniques. The MALDI image\nreveals a heterogeneous localization of PFOA within the tissue, which\ncould not be observed using a higher-resolution technique such as\nTOF-SIMS. Surprisingly, we could not detect any PFOA in the blood\nvessel using both techniques although many studies have reported the\npresence of PFOA in blood. 43  However, this\ncould be a vein, an artery, or even a biliary duct, influencing its\nchemical composition. The PFOA concentration in the blood could also\nbe below the detection limit. Contrary to LC–MS/MS results,\nPFOA was not detected in the control (images not reported) probably\ndue to the detection limit of the instruments.\n\nBased on\nLC–MS/MS data analysis using MS-dial, about 1500 lipid species\nwere identified and 383 identified lipid peaks were significantly\ndifferent between the case and the control (only MS/MS peaks,  p -values below 0.05, and absolute value of fold changes\nhigher than 2). Among significant lipids, 171 lipid species were identified\nin positive mode and 233 lipid species in negative mode. Of those\nlipids, 21 were identified in both ion modes and for further analysis,\nthey were excluded from the positive data set to avoid duplicates.\n\nFigure  2 a summarizes\nall the hepatic lipid categories significantly impacted after PFOA\nexposure (grouping data of negative and positive modes), some lipid\nclasses (the most impacted appearing in bold), and the number of lipids\nfor each category (see the number of lipids for each lipid class in  Table S1 ). The most represented category is glycerophospholipids.\nOverall, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC),\nand TG are the most impacted lipid classes in terms of lipid number\n(see lipid structures in  Figure S5 ). All\nPE, PC, and TG lipid species significantly impacted by PFOA exposure\nand present in higher or lower levels are listed in  Tables S2–S4 , respectively. A higher (lower) level\nof one lipid species in the liver can be the result of either a higher\n(lower) production or a lower (higher) consumption within the tissue\nresulting in accumulation (decrease), or even a lower (higher) export\ninto the blood. One interesting observation is that, for example,\nPE\n38:4 | PE 18:0_20:4 is present at lower levels, while PE 38:4 | PE\n18:1_20:3 is present at higher levels. Both lipids have the same chain\nlength and number of double bonds, but the latter are positioned differently\nin the chain, highlighting the importance of precise molecule identification.\n\nLipid\nannotation and statistical analysis. (a) Summary of the LC–MS/MS\ndata of the lipid categories and classes significantly impacted after\nPFOA exposure. The most impacted lipid classes in terms of lipid numbers\nappear in bold. (b) Two dimensional PCA scores of lipid species for\ncontrols (blue) and cases (red). The label name indicates the biological\nreplicate (first label number) and the technical replicate (second\nlabel number). (c) Loading plot showing lipids with the highest absolute\nPC1 value: the lipids in red are significantly higher in the case\nsamples and the lipids in blue are significantly higher in the control\nsamples.\n\nThe high information content of such global lipid\nanalysis requires\nthe use of data analysis methods, such as multi-variate analysis,\nwhich enables the identification of the lipids contributing the most\nto variation or separation between groups. We first performed PCA\nanalysis, an unbiased method, and then PLS-DA, a supervised method\nbased on PCA results. The PCA scores plot ( Figure  2 b) shows a clear separation between the control\nand case groups, confirming the metabolomic difference at the hepatic\nlevel and thus allowing for subsequent supervised analysis. The first\nprincipal component (PC1) explained 87.4% of the observed variation\nwithin the data. A lipid with a positive PC1 value is more abundant\nin the case while a lipid with a negative PC1 value is more abundant\nin the control. It should be mentioned that the technical replicates\n(tr1 and tr2) of all biological replicates (br1, br2, and br3) show\nvery similar values, as expected. The PCA loading plot ( Figure  2 c) highlights the lipids maximizing\nthe variance (PC1 ≥ 0.07 or ≤ −0.07) between\nthe case and control samples. The PLS-DA analysis, highlighting the\nlipids that maximize the co-variance, and performed for comparison\npurposes, shows similar results ( Figure S6 ).\n\nBased on the LC–MS/MS\ndata, we first performed lipidomic pathway analysis using the MetaboAnalyst\nonline platform as done in similar studies. 22 , 44 Figure S7  gives an overview of all pathways\nsignificantly impacted by PFOA exposure, highlighting the glycerophospholipid\nmetabolism as being the most impacted pathway. This result was expected\nbased on the data displayed in  Figure  2 a and corroborates previous findings in human and animal\nstudies. 22 , 44  Indeed, the glycerophospholipid metabolism\npathway was overrepresented in human groups highly exposed to PFAS\n(including PFOA) and was further correlated in patients with high\nmacrosteatosis and increasing stages of fibrosis. 22  In addition, this pathway was also overrepresented in the\nmouse liver after PFOS exposure. 44  The\nmain drawback of this pathway analysis is that lipid classes (PE,\nPC, etc.) are mostly considered ( Figure S8 ) without considering the lipid species in each class. However, as\nobserved in  Figure  2 c, the levels of single lipid species from the same class can be\ncompletely different after PFOA exposure (higher or lower in the case\nsamples).\n\nTherefore, we instead used LINEX software, providing\nlipidomic networks connecting lipid species together, as shown in  Figure  3 a,b. The first network\n( Figure  3 a) shows a\nglobal view of the changes in the lipidome between the control and\nthe case, while the second one ( Figure  3 b) is more focused on the lipid classes impacted by\nPFOA exposure. In these networks, each node represents a lipid species,\nand each edge between a pair of lipids indicates the biochemical reaction\nthat transforms one lipid species into another within each class or\nbetween classes. Edge colors indicate the reaction types (i.e., chain\nlength or elongation, desaturation, FA addition, head group modification,\nor hydroxylation), and node sizes indicate the significance of the\ndifference between the PFOA-exposed and control conditions (the larger\nthe nodes are, the more strongly altered the lipids are). In  Figure  3 a, node colors represent\nthe log fold change between the two conditions (red: higher levels\nin PFOA-exposed animals and blue: lower levels in PFOA-exposed animals)\nwhile in  Figure  3 b,\nnode colors represent the lipid classes.\n\n(a,b) LINEX lipid network\nbased on LC–MS/MS lipid data.\nEach node represents a lipid species, and each edge between a pair\nof nodes indicates a biochemical reaction transforming the lipid species\ninto each other within one class or between classes. Edge colors indicate\nthe reaction types, and node sizes indicate the negative log10 FDR\ncorrected  p -values of lipid species between the control\nand case groups. (a) Node colors represent the log fold change between\nboth groups (red: higher level in the cases and blue: lower level\nin the cases). (b) Node colors represent the lipid classes. (c) LINEX\nenrichment network with the LPE to PE reaction at the center ( p -value of 0.0167). Spherical nodes represent lipids, and\nthe colors refer to LPE (light blue) or PE (dark blue) lipid species.\nTriangular nodes represent the enzyme class.\n\nRegarding fold changes, there is an equivalent\nnumber of lipids\nwith increased or decreased levels after PFOA ( Figure  3 a). Some categories such as PI or PE have\nmainly increased levels in PFOA-exposed livers while some others such\nas PC have mainly decreased levels. The other ones are either increased\nor decreased. Regarding reaction types, FA addition is the most prevalent\none (highlighted in green in  Figure  3 a,b), which suggests that the pathways involving this\ntype of metabolic reactions are specifically impacted by the PFOA.\n\nFigure  3 c shows\nthe enrichment network generated by LINEX based on the global networks.\nThe algorithm highlights a dysregulated subnetwork maximizing the\nreaction difference between the control and case conditions. 39  The resulting subnetwork consists only of PE\nand LPE lipid species, and the LPE to PE class reactions, which can\nbe catalyzed by phospholipase enzymes such as PLA2, PLBD1 (producing\nFA and LPE from PE), or lysophospholipid acyltransferase enzymes such\nas MBOAT1, LPCAT4, and LPEAT1 (producing PE by adding one FA to LPE).\nThe specific LPE to PE reaction that seems to be modulated by PFOA\ninvolves myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid\n(16:1), or linoleic acid (18:2) as fatty acids. We should further\ninvestigate the regulation of such enzymes in order to validate this\nhypothesis.\n\nWe further explored the lipidomic changes induced\nby PFOA exposure.  Figure  4 a represents the\nabundance (i.e., the average signal intensity of all lipid species)\nin the control and case groups for each lipid class. The three lipid\nclasses, which are statistically different between both groups, are\nPC, PE, and TG. The abundance of PC species is significantly higher\nin control livers, whereas the abundance of PE and TG is significantly\nin PFOA-exposed livers ( p -value < 0.0001). PE\nand PC are the most abundant phospholipids in the mammalian cell membrane.\nAbnormally high or low cellular PC/PE molar ratios may affect energy\nmetabolism and play a role in the progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis. 45  Moreover, the relative abundance of PC and PE\nregulates the size and dynamics of lipid droplets (LDs) (TG reservoir),\ncorroborating the excessive TG accumulation within hepatocytes after\nPFOA exposure, as concluded from our LC–MS/MS analysis and\nalso reported in many studies. 10 − 13\n\n(a) Lipid class composition abundance highlighting PC,\nPE, and\nTG classes, which are statistically different between case and control\nconditions (one-way ANOVA,  **** p -value\n< 0.0001) and (b–d) corresponding chain length–double\nbond abundance. The dot sizes indicate the lipid abundance, and the\ndot colors correspond to the control (blue) or case (red) samples.\n\nFigure  4 b−d\nshows the double bond abundance depending on the chain length for\nPC, PE, and TG lipid classes, respectively. The dot sizes indicate\nthe lipid abundance, and the dot colors correspond to the control\n(blue) or case (red) samples. For example, the PC lipids present at\nhigher levels in control samples have a chain length between 38 and\n40 carbons and a double bond number of between 4 and 6 while PC lipids\npresent at higher levels in case samples have a chain length of 34\ncarbons and three double bonds. Besides PE, PC, and TG,  Figure S9  provides a summary of the chain length–double\nbond relationship for the other most abundant classes. Comparing all\nclasses, the lipids with a longer chain length and a higher number\nof double bonds tend to decrease with PFOA exposure (i.e., they are\nmore abundant in control samples) and contrariwise and the lipids\nwith a shorter chain length and fewer double bonds tend to increase\nwith PFOA exposure (i.e., they are more abundant in case samples).\nFor example, increased levels of glycerophospholipid containing saturated\nfat could result in a rigid membrane environment and affect normal\nfunctions of membrane proteins. 30  However,\nthere are some exceptions: for example, most DG lipids decrease whereas\nmost TGs increase after exposure.\n\nIn addition, it is worth noting\nthat the lipid species that are\nmostly less abundant in control samples are made of dietary fatty\nacids. Indeed, animals are unable to synthesize de novo either  n -6 or  n -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\n(PUFAs) or any fatty acid with more than three double bonds; instead,\nthey must be obtained from the diet. 46  However,\nlipids that are more abundant in the case samples might not come from\nincreased fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity because the FAS expression\ndid not change after exposure (data not shown). Instead, the activity\nof elongases and desaturases might be disturbed, and their expression\nshould be assessed.\n\nThe lack of PUFAs in the liver has been\nshown to be harmful, e.g.,\nPUFAs have been reported to play a role in protecting against non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease and its progression to more severe forms. 47 , 48\n\nIn addition\nto the lipidomic pathway investigations presented above, lipids were\nidentified and localized in the tissue sections from both groups (two\nbiological replicates per group and two images in each polarity) by\nMALDI-MSI. PCA analysis was then performed on those lipidomic data\non the whole images ( Figure S10 ). As for\nLC–MS/MS results, PC1 explains most of the differences between\nthe case and control samples. However, the lipids contributing most\nto the variation were slightly different than the ones identified\nin LC–MS/MS data using MS-dial, which is discussed below.  Figure  5 a reveals the lipids\nwith the highest and lowest PC1 values (≥ 0.1 and ≤\n−0.1) based on MALDI analysis in negative mode. The LINEX analysis\nof the LC–MS/MS data showed lipids with 38 and 40 carbons and\nmore than four double bonds to be correlated with the control samples,\nwhile shorter, more saturated lipids were correlated with the PFOA\nexposed samples. The same trend is visible in  Figure  5 a.  Figure  5 b,c shows the image superposition of three lipids before\nand after PFOA exposure: PE 36:1 (increased level), PE 38:6 (decreased\nlevel), and PA 32:0 (unchanged level). PA 32:0 localizes in the blood\nvessels (BVs) and remains unchanged after exposure. On the contrary,\nPE 36:1 and PE 38:6 distribute evenly within the tissue before PFOA\nexposure and unevenly after exposure. Indeed, heterogeneities appear\nin terms of lipid distribution in  Figure  5 c, and it seems that some regions remain\nunchanged after exposure (less impacted) while others display changes\nin lipid levels: PE 36:1 increases and PE 38:6 decreases. Moreover,\nthe BVs are not surrounded by the same regions, probably because they\nconsist of different vascular tissues or even bile ducts. Our most\ninteresting observation was that PFOA localizes in the region the\nmost impacted, which means with a higher level of PE 36:1 and a lower\nlevel of PE 38:6 ( Figure  5 d). The PFOA does not appear in the PCA analysis because it\nwas performed only on identified lipids using the LIPIDMAPS database,\nthus excluding PFOA ions.\n\n(a) PCA loading plot of the lipids contributing\nmost to the variation\n(PC1 ≥ 0.1 or ≤ −0.1) between case and control\nimages by MALDI in negative mode. Lipids with a positive PC1 value\nhave increased levels after PFOA exposure (black bars) while lipids\nwith a negative PC1 value have decreased levels after exposure (gray\nbars).

A PCA analysis was\nthen performed on ROI1 and ROI2, which only appear after exposure.\nPC2 explains the difference between the two ROIs at 22.5%, and  Figure  6 a reveals the lipids\nwith the highest (related to ROI2) and lowest (related ROI1) PC2 values\n(≥ 0.1 and ≤ −0.1). The localization of PE 34:1\n( Figure  6 b) and PE\n38:6 ( Figure  6 c) in\ncontrol and case samples are shown as representative examples of lipids\nrelated to ROI2 and ROI1, respectively. For both examples, we observed\nthat the signal intensity in ROI1 in the case is similar to the one\nin the control, which is probably less impacted by PFOA exposure than\nROI2. Indeed, lipids related to control samples in  Figure  5 a are also related to ROI1\nin  Figure  6 a, such\nas PI 38:4, PE 40:6, PA 38:4, PE 40:4, or PE 38:6. On the contrary,\nthe lipids related to case samples are mostly related to ROI2, such\nas PE 34:1, PI 34:1, or PE 36:1. Segmentation and statistical analysis\nwere also performed on the positive mode images ( Figure S12 ). By identifying and localizing lipids detected\nin both modes, such as PE 38:3, each ROI obtained from the segmentation\nin positive mode could be correlated with the corresponding one in\nnegative mode. In addition, BV regions were clearly identified by\nthe heme (from the hemoglobin), which is only detected in positive\nmode.\n\n(a) PCA loading plot of the lipids contributing most to variation\n(PC2 ≥ 0.1 or ≤ −0.1) between ROI1 and ROI2 isolated\nin the images of the case samples in negative mode. Lipids with a\npositive PC2 value have higher levels in ROI2 (black bars) while lipids\nwith a negative PC2 value have higher levels in ROI1 (gray bars).\n(b,c) MALDI images of PE 34:1 (b) and PE 38:6 (c) in control and case\nsamples.\n\nAlthough, as mentioned above, PFOA does not appear\nin the PCA analysis,\nit is also localized in ROI2. Indeed, the colocalization analysis\nperformed on the whole data set clearly showed that a significant,\nnon-random spatial correlation exists between PFOA and lipids, such\nas PE 36:1, PE 34:1, and PA 34:1 identified in ROI2. In conclusion,\nPFOA is mostly localized in the ROI with shorter chain, more saturated\nlipids.\n\nComparing MALDI and LC–MS/MS results, the levels\nof lipid\nspecies after PFOA exposure change similarly (increase or decrease)\nfor both techniques, as expected ( Table S5 ). However, due to differences in lipid extraction (LC → solvents,\nMALDI → matrix) and ionization (LC → ESI, MALDI →\nlaser), a few lipids present in the MSI data could not be identified\nwith LC–MS/MS and conversely, many lipids identified by LC–MS/MS\nwere not detected/identified by MALDI, emphasizing the importance\nof combining techniques to have a complete picture of lipidomic profiles\nand their changes after PFOA exposure. In this regard, only a few\nTG lipids were identified by MALDI in positive mode. Likewise, the\nLDs, intracellular energy stores mainly compartmentalizing TG lipids,\ncannot be observed on MALDI images. However, an increase of the number\nand size of those LDs after PFOA exposure was observed by LM using\nOil Red O ( Figure S13 ) and was confirmed\nin other studies. 11 , 19  This issue may be due to problems\nduring sample preparation or the unsuitability of the DAN matrix for\nthe detection of TGs. Methods using salt doping combined to matrix\nsublimation 49  or silver-assisted laser\ndesorption ionization 50  could improve the\ndetection of TG and other neutral lipids."

Among significant lipids, 171 lipid species were identified\nin positive mode and 233 lipid species in negative mode. Of those\nlipids, 21 were identified in both ion modes and for further analysis,\nthey were excluded from the positive data set to avoid duplicates.\n\nFigure  2 a summarizes\nall the hepatic lipid categories significantly impacted after PFOA\nexposure (grouping data of negative and positive modes), some lipid\nclasses (the most impacted appearing in bold), and the number of lipids\nfor each category (see the number of lipids for each lipid class in  Table S1 ). The most represented category is glycerophospholipids.\nOverall, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC),\nand TG are the most impacted lipid classes in terms of lipid number\n(see lipid structures in  Figure S5 ). All\nPE, PC, and TG lipid species significantly impacted by PFOA exposure\nand present in higher or lower levels are listed in  Tables S2–S4 , respectively. A higher (lower) level\nof one lipid species in the liver can be the result of either a higher\n(lower) production or a lower (higher) consumption within the tissue\nresulting in accumulation (decrease), or even a lower (higher) export\ninto the blood. One interesting observation is that, for example,\nPE\n38:4 | PE 18:0_20:4 is present at lower levels, while PE 38:4 | PE\n18:1_20:3 is present at higher levels. Both lipids have the same chain\nlength and number of double bonds, but the latter are positioned differently\nin the chain, highlighting the importance of precise molecule identification.\n\nLipid\nannotation and statistical analysis.

We first performed PCA\nanalysis, an unbiased method, and then PLS-DA, a supervised method\nbased on PCA results. The PCA scores plot ( Figure  2 b) shows a clear separation between the control\nand case groups, confirming the metabolomic difference at the hepatic\nlevel and thus allowing for subsequent supervised analysis. The first\nprincipal component (PC1) explained 87.4% of the observed variation\nwithin the data. A lipid with a positive PC1 value is more abundant\nin the case while a lipid with a negative PC1 value is more abundant\nin the control. It should be mentioned that the technical replicates\n(tr1 and tr2) of all biological replicates (br1, br2, and br3) show\nvery similar values, as expected.

This result was expected\nbased on the data displayed in  Figure  2 a and corroborates previous findings in human and animal\nstudies. 22 , 44  Indeed, the glycerophospholipid metabolism\npathway was overrepresented in human groups highly exposed to PFAS\n(including PFOA) and was further correlated in patients with high\nmacrosteatosis and increasing stages of fibrosis. 22  In addition, this pathway was also overrepresented in the\nmouse liver after PFOS exposure. 44  The\nmain drawback of this pathway analysis is that lipid classes (PE,\nPC, etc.) are mostly considered ( Figure S8 ) without considering the lipid species in each class. However, as\nobserved in  Figure  2 c, the levels of single lipid species from the same class can be\ncompletely different after PFOA exposure (higher or lower in the case\nsamples).\n\nTherefore, we instead used LINEX software, providing\nlipidomic networks connecting lipid species together, as shown in  Figure  3 a,b.

Lipids with a\npositive PC2 value have higher levels in ROI2 (black bars) while lipids\nwith a negative PC2 value have higher levels in ROI1 (gray bars).\n(b,c) MALDI images of PE 34:1 (b) and PE 38:6 (c) in control and case\nsamples.\n\nAlthough, as mentioned above, PFOA does not appear\nin the PCA analysis,\nit is also localized in ROI2. Indeed, the colocalization analysis\nperformed on the whole data set clearly showed that a significant,\nnon-random spatial correlation exists between PFOA and lipids, such\nas PE 36:1, PE 34:1, and PA 34:1 identified in ROI2. In conclusion,\nPFOA is mostly localized in the ROI with shorter chain, more saturated\nlipids.\n\nComparing MALDI and LC–MS/MS results, the levels\nof lipid\nspecies after PFOA exposure change similarly (increase or decrease)\nfor both techniques, as expected ( Table S5 ). However, due to differences in lipid extraction (LC → solvents,\nMALDI → matrix) and ionization (LC → ESI, MALDI →\nlaser), a few lipids present in the MSI data could not be identified\nwith LC–MS/MS and conversely, many lipids identified by LC–MS/MS\nwere not detected/identified by MALDI, emphasizing the importance\nof combining techniques to have a complete picture of lipidomic profiles\nand their changes after PFOA exposure. In this regard, only a few\nTG lipids were identified by MALDI in positive mode. Likewise, the\nLDs, intracellular energy stores mainly compartmentalizing TG lipids,\ncannot be observed on MALDI images. However, an increase of the number\nand size of those LDs after PFOA exposure was observed by LM using\nOil Red O ( Figure S13 ) and was confirmed\nin other studies. 11 , 19  This issue may be due to problems\nduring sample preparation or the unsuitability of the DAN matrix for\nthe detection of TGs. Methods using salt doping combined to matrix\nsublimation 49  or silver-assisted laser\ndesorption ionization 50  could improve the\ndetection of TG and other neutral lipids."

      "text": "This multi-modal MS analysis has provided\ninsightful information\nabout the fate and lipidomic impacts of PFOA in the mouse liver. The\nperflurinated compound was identified with all the MS techniques.\nRegarding lipidomics, LC–MS/MS analysis enables us to identify\na great range and number of lipid species but only gives a general\noverview of the changes between sample groups, while MALDI-MSI analysis\nhas the advantage of providing location-specific lipidomic profiles\nwithin liver tissues. Due to its destructive nature, TOF-SIMS mostly\ndetects fatty acids (fragments) and entire lipid molecules with very\nlow intensities. As one fragment can be associated with many different\nmolecules, lipid imaging with this technique was not further investigated\nin this paper.\n\nHigh-dose acute exposure to PFOA leads to hepatic\nlipid dysmetabolism,\nsuch as the impairment of glycerophospholipid or glycerolipid metabolism.\nThese metabolism pathways were also impacted in previous human and\nanimal studies with PFAS. Rodent studies with PFAS (usually at high\ndoses) have shown increased intrahepatic lipid (mainly TG) concentrations.\nSimilarly, this study has demonstrated increased intrahepatic TG levels\nbut has also shown the dysregulation of other lipid classes, such\nas PC and PE. The relative abundance of PC and PE lipids regulates\nthe size and dynamics of LDs (TG reservoir), corroborating the excessive\nTG accumulation within hepatocytes after PFOA exposure. In addition,\nwe have demonstrated the importance of considering the lipids as individual\nlipid species and not according to their lipid class. Indeed, lipid\nspecies in the same lipid class can behave completely differently,\neven those with the same chain length and number of double bonds but\ndifferent distributions between the two fatty acid chains. Therefore,\na precise lipid identification is essential for a rigorous lipidomic\npathway analysis.\n\nLINEX network analysis has provided an overview\nof the changes\nof the lipidome after PFOA exposure, and network enrichment analysis\nshowed that the LPE to PE class reactions, which can be catalyzed\nby enzymes such as MBOAT1, were the most impacted subnetwork. Enzyme\nregulation analysis or the targeted transcriptomic measurement of\ngenes and proteins could help validate and aid the interpretation\nof these lipidomic data.\n\nComparing all lipid classes, lipids\nwith a longer chain length\nand a higher number of double bonds tend to decrease with PFOA exposure\nand contrariwise, the lipids with shorter chain length and less double\nbonds tend to increase with PFOA exposure. It is noteworthy that the\nlipid species most impacted by PFOA exposure are made exclusively\nfrom dietary fatty acids (4+ double bonds) while lipids increased\nin case samples can be derived from either dietary sources or de novo\nfatty acid synthesis.\n\nAlthough cross-sections of the liver show\na homogeneous patchwork\nof hepatocytes infiltrated with some vascular tissue and bile ducts,\nthe lipid imaging analysis revealed different regions with their own\nlipidomic profile. PFOA was localized in one of those regions, colocalizing\nwith some dysregulated lipid species (shorter chain, more saturated\nlipids). Analytical development enabling an MS 2  acquisition\nevery other pixel as demonstrated by Ellis et al. 51  could provide a precise lipid identification and localization\nand would definitely be a step forward for lipidomics."

  "full_text": "Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a synthetic perfluorinated\nchemical\nclassified as a persistent organic pollutant. PFOA has been linked\nto many toxic effects, including liver injury. Many studies report\nthat PFOA exposure alters serum and hepatic lipid metabolism. However,\nlipidomic pathways altered by PFOA exposure are largely unknown and\nonly a few lipid classes, mostly triacylglycerol (TG), are usually\nconsidered in lipid analysis. Here, we performed a global lipidomic\nanalysis on the liver of PFOA-exposed (high-dose and short-duration)\nand control mice by combining three mass spectrometry (MS) techniques:\nliquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS),\nmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging\n(MALDI-MSI), and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).\nAmong all hepatic lipids identified by LC–MS/MS analysis, more\nthan 350 were statistically impacted (increased or decreased levels)\nafter PFOA exposure, as confirmed by multi-variate data analysis.\nThe levels of many lipid species from different lipid classes, most\nnotably phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and\nTG, were significantly altered. Subsequent lipidomic analysis highlights\nthe pathways significantly impacted by PFOA exposure, with the glycerophospholipid\nmetabolism being the most impacted, and the changes in the lipidome\nnetwork, which connects all the lipid species together. MALDI-MSI\ndisplays the heterogeneous distribution of the affected lipids and\nPFOA, revealing different areas of lipid expression linked to PFOA\nlocalization. TOF-SIMS localizes PFOA at the cellular level, supporting\nMALDI-MSI results. This multi-modal MS analysis unveils the lipidomic\nimpact of PFOA in the mouse liver after high-dose and short-term exposure\nand opens new opportunities in toxicology.\n\n## Experimental Section\n\nChemicals and solvents (analytical grade)\nwere purchased from the following sources: gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich,\nUSA), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1,5-diaminonaphthalene\n97% (DAN) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), acetonitrile (ACN) (Honeywell,\nGermany), chloroform (Acros Organics, Belgium), and methanol (Carl\nRoth, Germany). All chemicals were stored, handled, and disposed of\naccording to good laboratory practices (GLP).\n\nIn this study, we used 8-week-old\nmale C57BL/6NRj mice (Janvier Labs, France). They were kept in an\nanimal facility under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions at a\nconstant temperature (21 ± 2 °C) with a day/night cycle\nof 12 h and had free access to water and food (Harlan Teklad 2018,\nEnvigo, USA). All mice were acclimated to standard housing for 7 days.\nThe experimental procedures and protocols were approved by the local\nethics committee of Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées (APAFIS#21271)\nin accordance with European directive 2010/63/EU.\n\nFor the study,\nsix mice were divided into two groups (three animals/group), receiving\ntap water (control vehicle) or PFOA (prepared in tap water) daily\nby oral gavage at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day for 3 days.\nThe health status of the animals was monitored daily, and no change\nin mouse weight was observed. After 3 days of exposure, mice were\nsacrificed by cervical dislocation. The liver weight was doubled after\nacute exposure compared to control animals, with less red steatosis-like\ncolor. Liver samples were then collected for downstream analysis with\none piece for LC–MS/MS and one piece for MSI per animal.\n\nFor LC–MS/MS analysis, samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen\nand then stored at −80 °C, whereas samples for MSI analysis\nwere embedded in a warm (37 °C) aliquot of gelatin (10% w/v)\nand CMC (2.5% w/v), frozen in isopentane previously cooled down to\n−160 °C in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80\n°C.\n\nLiver samples from\nPFOA-exposed and control mice (three animals per group) were analyzed.\nMouse livers were weighted, transferred in plastic tubes, and homogenized\nin cold methanol (4 mL/g tissue) and deionized water (0.85 mL/g tissue)\nby bead beating in the Mixer Mill MM 400 (Retsch, Germany) with 0.1-mm\ndiameter zirconium beads at 30 Hz for 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting\nlysates were vortexed, transferred into glass vials, submerged with\ncold dichloromethane (2 mL/g tissue) and deionized water (2 mL/g tissue),\nand vortexed again. 10 μL EquiSPLASH Internal Standard (Avanti\nPolar lipids, USA) was added in each sample. The vials were vortexed,\nkept on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for\n15 min at 4 °C, resulting in two phases separated by proteins\nand cellular debris. The lower dichloromethane phases (with lipophilic\ncompounds) were carefully transferred using a Pasteur pipette into\nglass LC vials. The solvent was removed using the Refrigerated CentriVap\nVacuum Concentrator (Labconco, USA) at 4 °C, and the samples\nwere resuspended in 200 μL methanol and stored at −80\n°C until LC–MS/MS analysis. That lipid extraction procedure\nwas adapted from Beckonert and colleagues. 34\n\nLC–MS/MS analysis\nis performed using a Thermo Ultimate 3000 HPLC system coupled with\na Thermo linear trap quadrupole (LTQ)/orbitrap elite high-resolution\nmass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA), with the sample\nrack and the column at 40 °C. Mobile phases used for the separation\nare  A:  ACN/water (40:60) containing 10 mM ammonium acetate\nand  B:  ACN/isopropanol (10:90) containing 10 mM ammonium\nacetate). HPLC was performed with a gradient elution over 40 min,\n0–30 min:  A  70%  B  30% →  A  0.5%  B  99.5%, 30–40 min:  B  99.5%, flowrate: 0.4 mL/min, injection volume: 5 μL, column:\nKinetex C18 (250 × 4.6 mm 2 , 5 μm). TOP 3 DDA\nLC–MS/MS was performed using a 3 Da isolation window, with\nHCD45 fragmentation in separate runs, and full-scans over  m/z  350–1600, in positive and negative ion mode (four\nruns per sample in total).\n\nLC–MS/MS data were analyzed using MS–Data Independent\nAnaLysis (MS-dial) software for lipid annotation. 35  Peak assignation was performed by examining tandem mass\nspectra for diagnostic ion fragments along with associated chain fragment\ninformation. Moreover, the isotopic profile, ion chromatogram, mass\nerror of measured precursor, and fragment ions were examined to support\nidentification. Data were also analyzed using Metabolomic Pathway\nAnalysis (MetaboAnalyst,  https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/ ) platform for pathway enrichment\nanalysis 36 , 37  and Lipid Network Explorer (LINEX,  https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/linex/ ) platform for lipid network analysis. 38 , 39  Multi-variate\nanalyses, namely principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least\nsquares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were performed using MetaboAnalyst\non identified species. Data were normalized row-wise (normalization\nto constant sum) and column-wise (Pareto Scaling). Data were analyzed\nby one-way ANOVA using Graphpad Prism software (GraphPad Software\nInc., USA). All results are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Differences\nbetween groups were considered statistically significant when the  p -value < 0.05.\n\nLiver samples from PFOA-exposed\nand control mice (two animals per group) were analyzed considering\ntwo sections per sample. Cryo-fixed livers were cut into 10-μm\nsections and deposited on silicon wafer (Siltronix, France). Sections\nwere kept at −80 °C. Prior to analysis, they were dried\nin a vacuum desiccator for 30 min. Optical images of the tissue sections\nwere taken using an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Belgium). For\nMALDI analysis, sections were coated with a DAN matrix (10 mg/mL in\n70% v/v ACN) using a HTX TM sprayer (HTX Technologies LLC, USA). The\nfollowing parameters were applied: temperature 30 °C, flow rate\n0.12 mL/min, velocity 1200 mm/min, drying time 2 s, line spacing 2.5\nmm, pressure 10 psi, nozzle height 40 mm, and eight layers.\n\nThe TOF-SIMS analysis was\nperformed on a TOF-SIMS V (ION-TOF GmbH, Germany) instrument. Mass\nspectra acquisition and imaging experiments, presented hereafter,\nwere carried out with a 25 keV pulsed Bi 3 +  cluster\nion source, delivering a 0.14 pA target current. The specific “burst\nalignment delay extraction” (BADE) mode, with a dose of 1 ×\n10 12  Bi 3 +  ions/cm 2 , provides\na good compromise between lateral resolution (submicron) and mass\nresolution (5000 at  m/z  281). 40  The analyzed area was 500 × 500 μm 2  with a raster size of 1024 by 1024 pixels. Data were obtained in\nboth negative and positive modes, and the secondary ion mass spectra\nwere calibrated using C n –  carbon clusters and C x H y +  species, respectively.\n\nMALDI analysis on liver\nsections was performed as previously described 41  using an atmospheric pressure (AP)-MALDI ultra-high-resolution\n(UHR) ion source (Masstech Inc., USA) coupled with a LTQ-orbitrap\nelite high-resolution mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific,\nUSA) in positive and negative ion modes. For imaging, the AP-MALDI\nsource was operated in a “constant speed raster” motion\nmode with a stage stepping size of 20 μm. The laser energy was\n2000 Hz, and spot size was <20 μm. 41  Spectrum acquisition: 500 ms maximum injection time; mass range:\n350–1600 Da; and mass resolution: 120 k at  m/z  400.\n\nTOF-SIMS data\nanalysis was performed using SurfaceLab 7 (IONTOF GmbH, Germany).\nMALDI-MSI data were analyzed using Thermo Xcalibur 2.2 and Thermo\nImageQuest (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA), METASPACE ( https://metaspace2020.eu ), and\nLipostarMSI (Molecular Horizons Srl, Italy). All images were normalized\nto total ion count (TIC) and denoised by hotspot removal. Segmentation\n(bisecting K-means algorithm), colocalization, and PCA analyses were\nperformed using LipostarMSI.\n\n## Chemicals\n\nChemicals and solvents (analytical grade)\nwere purchased from the following sources: gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich,\nUSA), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1,5-diaminonaphthalene\n97% (DAN) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), acetonitrile (ACN) (Honeywell,\nGermany), chloroform (Acros Organics, Belgium), and methanol (Carl\nRoth, Germany).

All images were normalized\nto total ion count (TIC) and denoised by hotspot removal. Segmentation\n(bisecting K-means algorithm), colocalization, and PCA analyses were\nperformed using LipostarMSI.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nPFOA was clearly\nidentified in PFOA-exposed liver samples (“case”) using\nLC–MS/MS analysis after 1.45 min ( Figure  1 a) at  m/z  412.966 ( Figure  1 b) and confirmed\nby MS 2  spectrum ( Figure  1 c). The experimental isotope pattern of PFOA is consistent\nwith the theoretical one ( Figure S1 ), and\nthe MS 2  spectrum is in line with the literature. 42  Due to its omnipresence in the environment (and\nparticularly in the water), we also detected it in the control liver\nand even in the blank. The PFOA signal intensity was two orders of\nmagnitude lower in the control liver than in the case and two orders\nof magnitude lower in the blank than in the control ( Figure S2 ). The analytical reproducibility and the biological\nvariability were assessed by normalization with internal standards\n( Figure S3 ).\n\nPFOA identification and\nlocalization in the PFOA-exposed liver\nfor one representative animal by LC–MS/MS and MALDI-MSI: (a)\nliquid chromatogram (LC) at 1.45 min, (b) MS spectrum at  m/z  412.966, (c) MS/MS spectrum, and (d) MALDI-MSI image of PFOA (sum\nof [C 8 F 15 O 2 ] −  and\n[C 7 F 15 ] − ).\n\nPFOA was also successfully localized inside the\nliver using MALDI-MSI\n( Figure  1 d) and TOF-SIMS\n( Figure S4 ) techniques. The MALDI image\nreveals a heterogeneous localization of PFOA within the tissue, which\ncould not be observed using a higher-resolution technique such as\nTOF-SIMS. Surprisingly, we could not detect any PFOA in the blood\nvessel using both techniques although many studies have reported the\npresence of PFOA in blood. 43  However, this\ncould be a vein, an artery, or even a biliary duct, influencing its\nchemical composition. The PFOA concentration in the blood could also\nbe below the detection limit. Contrary to LC–MS/MS results,\nPFOA was not detected in the control (images not reported) probably\ndue to the detection limit of the instruments.\n\nBased on\nLC–MS/MS data analysis using MS-dial, about 1500 lipid species\nwere identified and 383 identified lipid peaks were significantly\ndifferent between the case and the control (only MS/MS peaks,  p -values below 0.05, and absolute value of fold changes\nhigher than 2). Among significant lipids, 171 lipid species were identified\nin positive mode and 233 lipid species in negative mode. Of those\nlipids, 21 were identified in both ion modes and for further analysis,\nthey were excluded from the positive data set to avoid duplicates.\n\nFigure  2 a summarizes\nall the hepatic lipid categories significantly impacted after PFOA\nexposure (grouping data of negative and positive modes), some lipid\nclasses (the most impacted appearing in bold), and the number of lipids\nfor each category (see the number of lipids for each lipid class in  Table S1 ). The most represented category is glycerophospholipids.\nOverall, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC),\nand TG are the most impacted lipid classes in terms of lipid number\n(see lipid structures in  Figure S5 ). All\nPE, PC, and TG lipid species significantly impacted by PFOA exposure\nand present in higher or lower levels are listed in  Tables S2–S4 , respectively. A higher (lower) level\nof one lipid species in the liver can be the result of either a higher\n(lower) production or a lower (higher) consumption within the tissue\nresulting in accumulation (decrease), or even a lower (higher) export\ninto the blood. One interesting observation is that, for example,\nPE\n38:4 | PE 18:0_20:4 is present at lower levels, while PE 38:4 | PE\n18:1_20:3 is present at higher levels. Both lipids have the same chain\nlength and number of double bonds, but the latter are positioned differently\nin the chain, highlighting the importance of precise molecule identification.\n\nLipid\nannotation and statistical analysis. (a) Summary of the LC–MS/MS\ndata of the lipid categories and classes significantly impacted after\nPFOA exposure. The most impacted lipid classes in terms of lipid numbers\nappear in bold. (b) Two dimensional PCA scores of lipid species for\ncontrols (blue) and cases (red). The label name indicates the biological\nreplicate (first label number) and the technical replicate (second\nlabel number). (c) Loading plot showing lipids with the highest absolute\nPC1 value: the lipids in red are significantly higher in the case\nsamples and the lipids in blue are significantly higher in the control\nsamples.\n\nThe high information content of such global lipid\nanalysis requires\nthe use of data analysis methods, such as multi-variate analysis,\nwhich enables the identification of the lipids contributing the most\nto variation or separation between groups. We first performed PCA\nanalysis, an unbiased method, and then PLS-DA, a supervised method\nbased on PCA results. The PCA scores plot ( Figure  2 b) shows a clear separation between the control\nand case groups, confirming the metabolomic difference at the hepatic\nlevel and thus allowing for subsequent supervised analysis. The first\nprincipal component (PC1) explained 87.4% of the observed variation\nwithin the data. A lipid with a positive PC1 value is more abundant\nin the case while a lipid with a negative PC1 value is more abundant\nin the control. It should be mentioned that the technical replicates\n(tr1 and tr2) of all biological replicates (br1, br2, and br3) show\nvery similar values, as expected. The PCA loading plot ( Figure  2 c) highlights the lipids maximizing\nthe variance (PC1 ≥ 0.07 or ≤ −0.07) between\nthe case and control samples. The PLS-DA analysis, highlighting the\nlipids that maximize the co-variance, and performed for comparison\npurposes, shows similar results ( Figure S6 ).\n\nBased on the LC–MS/MS\ndata, we first performed lipidomic pathway analysis using the MetaboAnalyst\nonline platform as done in similar studies. 22 , 44 Figure S7  gives an overview of all pathways\nsignificantly impacted by PFOA exposure, highlighting the glycerophospholipid\nmetabolism as being the most impacted pathway. This result was expected\nbased on the data displayed in  Figure  2 a and corroborates previous findings in human and animal\nstudies. 22 , 44  Indeed, the glycerophospholipid metabolism\npathway was overrepresented in human groups highly exposed to PFAS\n(including PFOA) and was further correlated in patients with high\nmacrosteatosis and increasing stages of fibrosis. 22  In addition, this pathway was also overrepresented in the\nmouse liver after PFOS exposure. 44  The\nmain drawback of this pathway analysis is that lipid classes (PE,\nPC, etc.) are mostly considered ( Figure S8 ) without considering the lipid species in each class. However, as\nobserved in  Figure  2 c, the levels of single lipid species from the same class can be\ncompletely different after PFOA exposure (higher or lower in the case\nsamples).\n\nTherefore, we instead used LINEX software, providing\nlipidomic networks connecting lipid species together, as shown in  Figure  3 a,b. The first network\n( Figure  3 a) shows a\nglobal view of the changes in the lipidome between the control and\nthe case, while the second one ( Figure  3 b) is more focused on the lipid classes impacted by\nPFOA exposure. In these networks, each node represents a lipid species,\nand each edge between a pair of lipids indicates the biochemical reaction\nthat transforms one lipid species into another within each class or\nbetween classes. Edge colors indicate the reaction types (i.e., chain\nlength or elongation, desaturation, FA addition, head group modification,\nor hydroxylation), and node sizes indicate the significance of the\ndifference between the PFOA-exposed and control conditions (the larger\nthe nodes are, the more strongly altered the lipids are). In  Figure  3 a, node colors represent\nthe log fold change between the two conditions (red: higher levels\nin PFOA-exposed animals and blue: lower levels in PFOA-exposed animals)\nwhile in  Figure  3 b,\nnode colors represent the lipid classes.\n\n(a,b) LINEX lipid network\nbased on LC–MS/MS lipid data.\nEach node represents a lipid species, and each edge between a pair\nof nodes indicates a biochemical reaction transforming the lipid species\ninto each other within one class or between classes. Edge colors indicate\nthe reaction types, and node sizes indicate the negative log10 FDR\ncorrected  p -values of lipid species between the control\nand case groups. (a) Node colors represent the log fold change between\nboth groups (red: higher level in the cases and blue: lower level\nin the cases). (b) Node colors represent the lipid classes. (c) LINEX\nenrichment network with the LPE to PE reaction at the center ( p -value of 0.0167). Spherical nodes represent lipids, and\nthe colors refer to LPE (light blue) or PE (dark blue) lipid species.\nTriangular nodes represent the enzyme class.\n\nRegarding fold changes, there is an equivalent\nnumber of lipids\nwith increased or decreased levels after PFOA ( Figure  3 a). Some categories such as PI or PE have\nmainly increased levels in PFOA-exposed livers while some others such\nas PC have mainly decreased levels. The other ones are either increased\nor decreased. Regarding reaction types, FA addition is the most prevalent\none (highlighted in green in  Figure  3 a,b), which suggests that the pathways involving this\ntype of metabolic reactions are specifically impacted by the PFOA.\n\nFigure  3 c shows\nthe enrichment network generated by LINEX based on the global networks.\nThe algorithm highlights a dysregulated subnetwork maximizing the\nreaction difference between the control and case conditions. 39  The resulting subnetwork consists only of PE\nand LPE lipid species, and the LPE to PE class reactions, which can\nbe catalyzed by phospholipase enzymes such as PLA2, PLBD1 (producing\nFA and LPE from PE), or lysophospholipid acyltransferase enzymes such\nas MBOAT1, LPCAT4, and LPEAT1 (producing PE by adding one FA to LPE).\nThe specific LPE to PE reaction that seems to be modulated by PFOA\ninvolves myristic acid (14:0), palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid\n(16:1), or linoleic acid (18:2) as fatty acids. We should further\ninvestigate the regulation of such enzymes in order to validate this\nhypothesis.\n\nWe further explored the lipidomic changes induced\nby PFOA exposure.  Figure  4 a represents the\nabundance (i.e., the average signal intensity of all lipid species)\nin the control and case groups for each lipid class. The three lipid\nclasses, which are statistically different between both groups, are\nPC, PE, and TG. The abundance of PC species is significantly higher\nin control livers, whereas the abundance of PE and TG is significantly\nin PFOA-exposed livers ( p -value < 0.0001). PE\nand PC are the most abundant phospholipids in the mammalian cell membrane.\nAbnormally high or low cellular PC/PE molar ratios may affect energy\nmetabolism and play a role in the progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis. 45  Moreover, the relative abundance of PC and PE\nregulates the size and dynamics of lipid droplets (LDs) (TG reservoir),\ncorroborating the excessive TG accumulation within hepatocytes after\nPFOA exposure, as concluded from our LC–MS/MS analysis and\nalso reported in many studies. 10 − 13\n\n(a) Lipid class composition abundance highlighting PC,\nPE, and\nTG classes, which are statistically different between case and control\nconditions (one-way ANOVA,  **** p -value\n< 0.0001) and (b–d) corresponding chain length–double\nbond abundance. The dot sizes indicate the lipid abundance, and the\ndot colors correspond to the control (blue) or case (red) samples.\n\nFigure  4 b−d\nshows the double bond abundance depending on the chain length for\nPC, PE, and TG lipid classes, respectively. The dot sizes indicate\nthe lipid abundance, and the dot colors correspond to the control\n(blue) or case (red) samples. For example, the PC lipids present at\nhigher levels in control samples have a chain length between 38 and\n40 carbons and a double bond number of between 4 and 6 while PC lipids\npresent at higher levels in case samples have a chain length of 34\ncarbons and three double bonds. Besides PE, PC, and TG,  Figure S9  provides a summary of the chain length–double\nbond relationship for the other most abundant classes. Comparing all\nclasses, the lipids with a longer chain length and a higher number\nof double bonds tend to decrease with PFOA exposure (i.e., they are\nmore abundant in control samples) and contrariwise and the lipids\nwith a shorter chain length and fewer double bonds tend to increase\nwith PFOA exposure (i.e., they are more abundant in case samples).\nFor example, increased levels of glycerophospholipid containing saturated\nfat could result in a rigid membrane environment and affect normal\nfunctions of membrane proteins. 30  However,\nthere are some exceptions: for example, most DG lipids decrease whereas\nmost TGs increase after exposure.\n\nIn addition, it is worth noting\nthat the lipid species that are\nmostly less abundant in control samples are made of dietary fatty\nacids. Indeed, animals are unable to synthesize de novo either  n -6 or  n -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids\n(PUFAs) or any fatty acid with more than three double bonds; instead,\nthey must be obtained from the diet. 46  However,\nlipids that are more abundant in the case samples might not come from\nincreased fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity because the FAS expression\ndid not change after exposure (data not shown). Instead, the activity\nof elongases and desaturases might be disturbed, and their expression\nshould be assessed.\n\nThe lack of PUFAs in the liver has been\nshown to be harmful, e.g.,\nPUFAs have been reported to play a role in protecting against non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease and its progression to more severe forms. 47 , 48\n\nIn addition\nto the lipidomic pathway investigations presented above, lipids were\nidentified and localized in the tissue sections from both groups (two\nbiological replicates per group and two images in each polarity) by\nMALDI-MSI. PCA analysis was then performed on those lipidomic data\non the whole images ( Figure S10 ). As for\nLC–MS/MS results, PC1 explains most of the differences between\nthe case and control samples. However, the lipids contributing most\nto the variation were slightly different than the ones identified\nin LC–MS/MS data using MS-dial, which is discussed below.  Figure  5 a reveals the lipids\nwith the highest and lowest PC1 values (≥ 0.1 and ≤\n−0.1) based on MALDI analysis in negative mode. The LINEX analysis\nof the LC–MS/MS data showed lipids with 38 and 40 carbons and\nmore than four double bonds to be correlated with the control samples,\nwhile shorter, more saturated lipids were correlated with the PFOA\nexposed samples. The same trend is visible in  Figure  5 a.  Figure  5 b,c shows the image superposition of three lipids before\nand after PFOA exposure: PE 36:1 (increased level), PE 38:6 (decreased\nlevel), and PA 32:0 (unchanged level). PA 32:0 localizes in the blood\nvessels (BVs) and remains unchanged after exposure. On the contrary,\nPE 36:1 and PE 38:6 distribute evenly within the tissue before PFOA\nexposure and unevenly after exposure. Indeed, heterogeneities appear\nin terms of lipid distribution in  Figure  5 c, and it seems that some regions remain\nunchanged after exposure (less impacted) while others display changes\nin lipid levels: PE 36:1 increases and PE 38:6 decreases. Moreover,\nthe BVs are not surrounded by the same regions, probably because they\nconsist of different vascular tissues or even bile ducts. Our most\ninteresting observation was that PFOA localizes in the region the\nmost impacted, which means with a higher level of PE 36:1 and a lower\nlevel of PE 38:6 ( Figure  5 d). The PFOA does not appear in the PCA analysis because it\nwas performed only on identified lipids using the LIPIDMAPS database,\nthus excluding PFOA ions.\n\n(a) PCA loading plot of the lipids contributing\nmost to the variation\n(PC1 ≥ 0.1 or ≤ −0.1) between case and control\nimages by MALDI in negative mode. Lipids with a positive PC1 value\nhave increased levels after PFOA exposure (black bars) while lipids\nwith a negative PC1 value have decreased levels after exposure (gray\nbars). (b,c) MALDI superposition images of PE 38:6 (red), PE 36:1\n(green), and PE 32:0 (blue) for the (b) control and (d) case conditions.\n(d) MALDI images of PFOA (sum of C 8 F 15 O 2 –  and C 7 F 15 – ) for the case condition.\n\nContrary to LC–MS/MS analysis where lipids\nare extracted\nfrom tissue homogenates, here we can distinguish different regions.\nWe further analyzed the images of the case samples by performing a\nsegmentation ( Figure S11 ), identifying\nthree main regions: the BVs and two regions of interests (ROIs), called\nROI1 and ROI2, with different lipidomic profiles. A PCA analysis was\nthen performed on ROI1 and ROI2, which only appear after exposure.\nPC2 explains the difference between the two ROIs at 22.5%, and  Figure  6 a reveals the lipids\nwith the highest (related to ROI2) and lowest (related ROI1) PC2 values\n(≥ 0.1 and ≤ −0.1). The localization of PE 34:1\n( Figure  6 b) and PE\n38:6 ( Figure  6 c) in\ncontrol and case samples are shown as representative examples of lipids\nrelated to ROI2 and ROI1, respectively. For both examples, we observed\nthat the signal intensity in ROI1 in the case is similar to the one\nin the control, which is probably less impacted by PFOA exposure than\nROI2. Indeed, lipids related to control samples in  Figure  5 a are also related to ROI1\nin  Figure  6 a, such\nas PI 38:4, PE 40:6, PA 38:4, PE 40:4, or PE 38:6. On the contrary,\nthe lipids related to case samples are mostly related to ROI2, such\nas PE 34:1, PI 34:1, or PE 36:1. Segmentation and statistical analysis\nwere also performed on the positive mode images ( Figure S12 ). By identifying and localizing lipids detected\nin both modes, such as PE 38:3, each ROI obtained from the segmentation\nin positive mode could be correlated with the corresponding one in\nnegative mode. In addition, BV regions were clearly identified by\nthe heme (from the hemoglobin), which is only detected in positive\nmode.\n\n(a) PCA loading plot of the lipids contributing most to variation\n(PC2 ≥ 0.1 or ≤ −0.1) between ROI1 and ROI2 isolated\nin the images of the case samples in negative mode. Lipids with a\npositive PC2 value have higher levels in ROI2 (black bars) while lipids\nwith a negative PC2 value have higher levels in ROI1 (gray bars).\n(b,c) MALDI images of PE 34:1 (b) and PE 38:6 (c) in control and case\nsamples.\n\nAlthough, as mentioned above, PFOA does not appear\nin the PCA analysis,\nit is also localized in ROI2. Indeed, the colocalization analysis\nperformed on the whole data set clearly showed that a significant,\nnon-random spatial correlation exists between PFOA and lipids, such\nas PE 36:1, PE 34:1, and PA 34:1 identified in ROI2. In conclusion,\nPFOA is mostly localized in the ROI with shorter chain, more saturated\nlipids.\n\nComparing MALDI and LC–MS/MS results, the levels\nof lipid\nspecies after PFOA exposure change similarly (increase or decrease)\nfor both techniques, as expected ( Table S5 ). However, due to differences in lipid extraction (LC → solvents,\nMALDI → matrix) and ionization (LC → ESI, MALDI →\nlaser), a few lipids present in the MSI data could not be identified\nwith LC–MS/MS and conversely, many lipids identified by LC–MS/MS\nwere not detected/identified by MALDI, emphasizing the importance\nof combining techniques to have a complete picture of lipidomic profiles\nand their changes after PFOA exposure. In this regard, only a few\nTG lipids were identified by MALDI in positive mode. Likewise, the\nLDs, intracellular energy stores mainly compartmentalizing TG lipids,\ncannot be observed on MALDI images. However, an increase of the number\nand size of those LDs after PFOA exposure was observed by LM using\nOil Red O ( Figure S13 ) and was confirmed\nin other studies. 11 , 19  This issue may be due to problems\nduring sample preparation or the unsuitability of the DAN matrix for\nthe detection of TGs. Methods using salt doping combined to matrix\nsublimation 49  or silver-assisted laser\ndesorption ionization 50  could improve the\ndetection of TG and other neutral lipids.\n\n## PFOA Identification and Localization\n\nPFOA was clearly\nidentified in PFOA-exposed liver samples (“case”) using\nLC–MS/MS analysis after 1.45 min ( Figure  1 a) at  m/z  412.966 ( Figure  1 b) and confirmed\nby MS 2  spectrum ( Figure  1 c). The experimental isotope pattern of PFOA is consistent\nwith the theoretical one ( Figure S1 ), and\nthe MS 2  spectrum is in line with the literature. 42  Due to its omnipresence in the environment (and\nparticularly in the water), we also detected it in the control liver\nand even in the blank. The PFOA signal intensity was two orders of\nmagnitude lower in the control liver than in the case and two orders\nof magnitude lower in the blank than in the control ( Figure S2 ). The analytical reproducibility and the biological\nvariability were assessed by normalization with internal standards\n( Figure S3 ).\n\nPFOA identification and\nlocalization in the PFOA-exposed liver\nfor one representative animal by LC–MS/MS and MALDI-MSI: (a)\nliquid chromatogram (LC) at 1.45 min, (b) MS spectrum at  m/z  412.966, (c) MS/MS spectrum, and (d) MALDI-MSI image of PFOA (sum\nof [C 8 F 15 O 2 ] −  and\n[C 7 F 15 ] − ).\n\nPFOA was also successfully localized inside the\nliver using MALDI-MSI\n( Figure  1 d) and TOF-SIMS\n( Figure S4 ) techniques. The MALDI image\nreveals a heterogeneous localization of PFOA within the tissue, which\ncould not be observed using a higher-resolution technique such as\nTOF-SIMS. Surprisingly, we could not detect any PFOA in the blood\nvessel using both techniques although many studies have reported the\npresence of PFOA in blood. 43  However, this\ncould be a vein, an artery, or even a biliary duct, influencing its\nchemical composition. The PFOA concentration in the blood could also\nbe below the detection limit. Contrary to LC–MS/MS results,\nPFOA was not detected in the control (images not reported) probably\ndue to the detection limit of the instruments.\n\n## Lipid Annotation and Statistical Analysis\n\nBased on\nLC–MS/MS data analysis using MS-dial, about 1500 lipid species\nwere identified and 383 identified lipid peaks were significantly\ndifferent between the case and the control (only MS/MS peaks,  p -values below 0.05, and absolute value of fold changes\nhigher than 2). Among significant lipids, 171 lipid species were identified\nin positive mode and 233 lipid species in negative mode. Of those\nlipids, 21 were identified in both ion modes and for further analysis,\nthey were excluded from the positive data set to avoid duplicates.\n\nFigure  2 a summarizes\nall the hepatic lipid categories significantly impacted after PFOA\nexposure (grouping data of negative and positive modes), some lipid\nclasses (the most impacted appearing in bold), and the number of lipids\nfor each category (see the number of lipids for each lipid class in  Table S1 ). The most represented category is glycerophospholipids.\nOverall, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC),\nand TG are the most impacted lipid classes in terms of lipid number\n(see lipid structures in  Figure S5 ). All\nPE, PC, and TG lipid species significantly impacted by PFOA exposure\nand present in higher or lower levels are listed in  Tables S2–S4 , respectively. A higher (lower) level\nof one lipid species in the liver can be the result of either a higher\n(lower) production or a lower (higher) consumption within the tissue\nresulting in accumulation (decrease), or even a lower (higher) export\ninto the blood. One interesting observation is that, for example,\nPE\n38:4 | PE 18:0_20:4 is present at lower levels, while PE 38:4 | PE\n18:1_20:3 is present at higher levels. Both lipids have the same chain\nlength and number of double bonds, but the latter are positioned differently\nin the chain, highlighting the importance of precise molecule identification.\n\nLipid\nannotation and statistical analysis. (a) Summary of the LC–MS/MS\ndata of the lipid categories and classes significantly impacted after\nPFOA exposure. The most impacted lipid classes in terms of lipid numbers\nappear in bold. (b) Two dimensional PCA scores of lipid species for\ncontrols (blue) and cases (red). The label name indicates the biological\nreplicate (first label number) and the technical replicate (second\nlabel number). (c) Loading plot showing lipids with the highest absolute\nPC1 value: the lipids in red are significantly higher in the case\nsamples and the lipids in blue are significantly higher in the control\nsamples.\n\nThe high information content of such global lipid\nanalysis requires\nthe use of data analysis methods, such as multi-variate analysis,\nwhich enables the identification of the lipids contributing the most\nto variation or separation between groups. We first performed PCA\nanalysis, an unbiased method, and then PLS-DA, a supervised method\nbased on PCA results. The PCA scores plot ( Figure  2 b) shows a clear separation between the control\nand case groups, confirming the metabolomic difference at the hepatic\nlevel and thus allowing for subsequent supervised analysis. The first\nprincipal component (PC1) explained 87.4% of the observed variation\nwithin the data. A lipid with a positive PC1 value is more abundant\nin the case while a lipid with a negative PC1 value is more abundant\nin the control. It should be mentioned that the technical replicates\n(tr1 and tr2) of all biological replicates (br1, br2, and br3) show\nvery similar values, as expected. The PCA loading plot ( Figure  2 c) highlights the lipids maximizing\nthe variance (PC1 ≥ 0.07 or ≤ −0.07) between\nthe case and control samples. The PLS-DA analysis, highlighting the\nlipids that maximize the co-variance, and performed for comparison\npurposes, shows similar results ( Figure S6 ).\n\n## Lipidomic Pathway Analysis\n\nBased on the LC–MS/MS\ndata, we first performed lipidomic pathway analysis using the MetaboAnalyst\nonline platform as done in similar studies. 22 , 44 Figure S7  gives an overview of all pathways\nsignificantly impacted by PFOA exposure, highlighting the glycerophospholipid\nmetabolism as being the most impacted pathway. This result was expected\nbased on the data displayed in  Figure  2 a and corroborates previous findings in human and animal\nstudies. 22 , 44  Indeed, the glycerophospholipid metabolism\npathway was overrepresented in human groups highly exposed to PFAS\n(including PFOA) and was further correlated in patients with high\nmacrosteatosis and increasing stages of fibrosis. 22  In addition, this pathway was also overrepresented in the\nmouse liver after PFOS exposure. 44  The\nmain drawback of this pathway analysis is that lipid classes (PE,\nPC, etc.) are mostly considered ( Figure S8 ) without considering the lipid species in each class.

PCA analysis was then performed on those lipidomic data\non the whole images ( Figure S10 ). As for\nLC–MS/MS results, PC1 explains most of the differences between\nthe case and control samples. However, the lipids contributing most\nto the variation were slightly different than the ones identified\nin LC–MS/MS data using MS-dial, which is discussed below.  Figure  5 a reveals the lipids\nwith the highest and lowest PC1 values (≥ 0.1 and ≤\n−0.1) based on MALDI analysis in negative mode. The LINEX analysis\nof the LC–MS/MS data showed lipids with 38 and 40 carbons and\nmore than four double bonds to be correlated with the control samples,\nwhile shorter, more saturated lipids were correlated with the PFOA\nexposed samples. The same trend is visible in  Figure  5 a.  Figure  5 b,c shows the image superposition of three lipids before\nand after PFOA exposure: PE 36:1 (increased level), PE 38:6 (decreased\nlevel), and PA 32:0 (unchanged level). PA 32:0 localizes in the blood\nvessels (BVs) and remains unchanged after exposure. On the contrary,\nPE 36:1 and PE 38:6 distribute evenly within the tissue before PFOA\nexposure and unevenly after exposure. Indeed, heterogeneities appear\nin terms of lipid distribution in  Figure  5 c, and it seems that some regions remain\nunchanged after exposure (less impacted) while others display changes\nin lipid levels: PE 36:1 increases and PE 38:6 decreases. Moreover,\nthe BVs are not surrounded by the same regions, probably because they\nconsist of different vascular tissues or even bile ducts. Our most\ninteresting observation was that PFOA localizes in the region the\nmost impacted, which means with a higher level of PE 36:1 and a lower\nlevel of PE 38:6 ( Figure  5 d). The PFOA does not appear in the PCA analysis because it\nwas performed only on identified lipids using the LIPIDMAPS database,\nthus excluding PFOA ions.\n\n(a) PCA loading plot of the lipids contributing\nmost to the variation\n(PC1 ≥ 0.1 or ≤ −0.1) between case and control\nimages by MALDI in negative mode. Lipids with a positive PC1 value\nhave increased levels after PFOA exposure (black bars) while lipids\nwith a negative PC1 value have decreased levels after exposure (gray\nbars).

A PCA analysis was\nthen performed on ROI1 and ROI2, which only appear after exposure.\nPC2 explains the difference between the two ROIs at 22.5%, and  Figure  6 a reveals the lipids\nwith the highest (related to ROI2) and lowest (related ROI1) PC2 values\n(≥ 0.1 and ≤ −0.1). The localization of PE 34:1\n( Figure  6 b) and PE\n38:6 ( Figure  6 c) in\ncontrol and case samples are shown as representative examples of lipids\nrelated to ROI2 and ROI1, respectively. For both examples, we observed\nthat the signal intensity in ROI1 in the case is similar to the one\nin the control, which is probably less impacted by PFOA exposure than\nROI2. Indeed, lipids related to control samples in  Figure  5 a are also related to ROI1\nin  Figure  6 a, such\nas PI 38:4, PE 40:6, PA 38:4, PE 40:4, or PE 38:6. On the contrary,\nthe lipids related to case samples are mostly related to ROI2, such\nas PE 34:1, PI 34:1, or PE 36:1. Segmentation and statistical analysis\nwere also performed on the positive mode images ( Figure S12 ). By identifying and localizing lipids detected\nin both modes, such as PE 38:3, each ROI obtained from the segmentation\nin positive mode could be correlated with the corresponding one in\nnegative mode. In addition, BV regions were clearly identified by\nthe heme (from the hemoglobin), which is only detected in positive\nmode.\n\n(a) PCA loading plot of the lipids contributing most to variation\n(PC2 ≥ 0.1 or ≤ −0.1) between ROI1 and ROI2 isolated\nin the images of the case samples in negative mode. Lipids with a\npositive PC2 value have higher levels in ROI2 (black bars) while lipids\nwith a negative PC2 value have higher levels in ROI1 (gray bars).\n(b,c) MALDI images of PE 34:1 (b) and PE 38:6 (c) in control and case\nsamples.\n\nAlthough, as mentioned above, PFOA does not appear\nin the PCA analysis,\nit is also localized in ROI2. Indeed, the colocalization analysis\nperformed on the whole data set clearly showed that a significant,\nnon-random spatial correlation exists between PFOA and lipids, such\nas PE 36:1, PE 34:1, and PA 34:1 identified in ROI2. In conclusion,\nPFOA is mostly localized in the ROI with shorter chain, more saturated\nlipids.\n\nComparing MALDI and LC–MS/MS results, the levels\nof lipid\nspecies after PFOA exposure change similarly (increase or decrease)\nfor both techniques, as expected ( Table S5 ). However, due to differences in lipid extraction (LC → solvents,\nMALDI → matrix) and ionization (LC → ESI, MALDI →\nlaser), a few lipids present in the MSI data could not be identified\nwith LC–MS/MS and conversely, many lipids identified by LC–MS/MS\nwere not detected/identified by MALDI, emphasizing the importance\nof combining techniques to have a complete picture of lipidomic profiles\nand their changes after PFOA exposure. In this regard, only a few\nTG lipids were identified by MALDI in positive mode. Likewise, the\nLDs, intracellular energy stores mainly compartmentalizing TG lipids,\ncannot be observed on MALDI images. However, an increase of the number\nand size of those LDs after PFOA exposure was observed by LM using\nOil Red O ( Figure S13 ) and was confirmed\nin other studies. 11 , 19  This issue may be due to problems\nduring sample preparation or the unsuitability of the DAN matrix for\nthe detection of TGs. Methods using salt doping combined to matrix\nsublimation 49  or silver-assisted laser\ndesorption ionization 50  could improve the\ndetection of TG and other neutral lipids.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis multi-modal MS analysis has provided\ninsightful information\nabout the fate and lipidomic impacts of PFOA in the mouse liver. The\nperflurinated compound was identified with all the MS techniques.\nRegarding lipidomics, LC–MS/MS analysis enables us to identify\na great range and number of lipid species but only gives a general\noverview of the changes between sample groups, while MALDI-MSI analysis\nhas the advantage of providing location-specific lipidomic profiles\nwithin liver tissues. Due to its destructive nature, TOF-SIMS mostly\ndetects fatty acids (fragments) and entire lipid molecules with very\nlow intensities. As one fragment can be associated with many different\nmolecules, lipid imaging with this technique was not further investigated\nin this paper.\n\nHigh-dose acute exposure to PFOA leads to hepatic\nlipid dysmetabolism,\nsuch as the impairment of glycerophospholipid or glycerolipid metabolism.\nThese metabolism pathways were also impacted in previous human and\nanimal studies with PFAS. Rodent studies with PFAS (usually at high\ndoses) have shown increased intrahepatic lipid (mainly TG) concentrations.\nSimilarly, this study has demonstrated increased intrahepatic TG levels\nbut has also shown the dysregulation of other lipid classes, such\nas PC and PE. The relative abundance of PC and PE lipids regulates\nthe size and dynamics of LDs (TG reservoir), corroborating the excessive\nTG accumulation within hepatocytes after PFOA exposure. In addition,\nwe have demonstrated the importance of considering the lipids as individual\nlipid species and not according to their lipid class. Indeed, lipid\nspecies in the same lipid class can behave completely differently,\neven those with the same chain length and number of double bonds but\ndifferent distributions between the two fatty acid chains. Therefore,\na precise lipid identification is essential for a rigorous lipidomic\npathway analysis.\n\nLINEX network analysis has provided an overview\nof the changes\nof the lipidome after PFOA exposure, and network enrichment analysis\nshowed that the LPE to PE class reactions, which can be catalyzed\nby enzymes such as MBOAT1, were the most impacted subnetwork. Enzyme\nregulation analysis or the targeted transcriptomic measurement of\ngenes and proteins could help validate and aid the interpretation\nof these lipidomic data.\n\nComparing all lipid classes, lipids\nwith a longer chain length\nand a higher number of double bonds tend to decrease with PFOA exposure\nand contrariwise, the lipids with shorter chain length and less double\nbonds tend to increase with PFOA exposure. It is noteworthy that the\nlipid species most impacted by PFOA exposure are made exclusively\nfrom dietary fatty acids (4+ double bonds) while lipids increased\nin case samples can be derived from either dietary sources or de novo\nfatty acid synthesis.\n\nAlthough cross-sections of the liver show\na homogeneous patchwork\nof hepatocytes infiltrated with some vascular tissue and bile ducts,\nthe lipid imaging analysis revealed different regions with their own\nlipidomic profile. PFOA was localized in one of those regions, colocalizing\nwith some dysregulated lipid species (shorter chain, more saturated\nlipids). Analytical development enabling an MS 2  acquisition\nevery other pixel as demonstrated by Ellis et al. 51  could provide a precise lipid identification and localization\nand would definitely be a step forward for lipidomics.",
