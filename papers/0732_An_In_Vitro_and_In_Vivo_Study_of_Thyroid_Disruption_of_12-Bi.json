  "abstract": "The\nnovel brominated flame retardant, 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane\n(BTBPE), is an emerging environmental pollutant with undetermined\ntoxicity. We investigated how BTBPE causes thyroid endocrine disruption\nwith integrated in silico, in vitro, and in vivo assays. In yeast\ntwo-hybrid and T-Screen assays, BTBPE interacted with zebrafish thyroid\nhormone receptors with binding energies weaker than the TR agonist-3,3′,5-Triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), and disrupted thyroid function as a thyroid\nreceptor (TR) agonist. We examined the bioconcentration, developmental\ntoxicity, and thyroid endocrine disruption in zebrafish after a 14-day\nexposure to BTBPE (1, 3, 10 μg/L). Thyroxine (T4) was lower\nin BTBPE-treated larvae, whereas corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)\nand thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were higher. The gene transcription\nalterations along the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were\nobserved. Furthermore, reduced locomotion suggested that BTBPE imparts\ndevelopmental neurotoxicity at zebrafish early developmental stage.\nEstablishing that BTBPE has thyroid endocrine-disrupting effects is\nan important step for understanding and managing BTBPE toxicity.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "The manufacture and use\nof primary legacy brominated flame retardants\n(BFRs), e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), have been limited\nworldwide and novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) have replaced\nthem. Increased use of 1,2-bis (2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE),\na typical NBFR, has created widespread environmental contamination.1,2 It has been detected in air,3 dust,4 soils,5 sediments,6 sludge, and surface water.7 Due to their highly hydrophobicity, BTBPE is seldom analyzed\nin surface water and up to 5.22 ng/L has been reported.8 However, like PBDEs, BTBPE shows environmental\npersistence and potential for bioaccumulation.1,9 It\nis present in mud carp (Cirrhinus molitorella) (518\n± 277 ng/g l.w.), crucian carp (Carassius auratus) (332 ± 315 ng/g l.w.),10 and shark\nlivers (up to 16.7 ng/g l.w.).11 BTBPE\nhas been shown in the food web of the South China Sea tropics.12 It has been detected in breast milk13 and human serum.14 The widespread presence of BTBPE indicates the need for the study\nof its environmental effects and potential toxicity. Thyroid\nhormones (THs) are vital to growth, development, metabolism,\nand energy expenditure, but are especially important in the early\ndevelopment of vertebrates.15 THs homeostasis\nis sensitive to many environmental toxicants, and can be affected\nby thyroid gland development, THs synthesis and transportation, liver\nelimination, and hypothalamus-pituitary feedback regulation.16 Transthyretin (TTR), deiodinases, and thyroid\nreceptors (TRs) have been implicated in thyroid endocrine disruption.15,17 The bioactive form of TH is T3, which interacts with TRs at tissue-specific\neffects.18,19 The predominant thyroid isoform, TRβ,\nhas a key role in the regulation of target gene transcription.20 Its interaction with thyroid endocrine disrupting\nchemicals leads to abnormal TH levels and activity.21,22 Thyroid endocrine disruptions can be caused by NBFRs, such as bis(2-ethylhexyl)\ntetrabromophthalate (TBPH),19 decabromodiphenyl\nethane (DBDPE),23,24 and pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB).25 Given that the structure of BTBPE is similar\nto that of PBDEs and TH,9 its potential\nthyroid endocrine disruptions are well worth exploring. Limited toxicological\nstudies have shown that BTBPE exposure may impair thyroid function.\nChicken eggs exposed to BTBPE have decreased type III iodothyronine\n5′-deiodinase (Dio3) gene transcription,26 whereas embryonic exposure to BTBPE in the American\nkestrel (Falco sparverius) inhibits type 2 deiodinase\n(Dio2) activity.27 One\nstudy showed a positive correlation between the BTBPE found in dust\nand human T3 levels suggesting thyroid endocrine disruption.28 The thyroid-disrupting effects of BTBPE are\nnot well-researched nor are the related mechanisms. Given its\nincreased use and potential risk to wildlife and humans,\nexploring BTBPE and its effects on the thyroid endocrine system and\nhuman and environmental health is warranted. We evaluated the thyroid-disrupting\neffects of BTBPE as follows: (1) Molecular docking in silico identified\naffinity and interactions between BTBPE and TRs; (2) In vitro recombinant\nyeast two-hybrid and T-Screen assays were used for rapid screening\nof thyroid-disrupting potentials; (3) BTBPE was tested for thyroid-disrupting\nactivity using zebrafish larvae; and (4) The locomotion of zebrafish\nlarvae was examined to assess developmental neurotoxicity. This is\nthe first in silico and in vitro evidence of the interaction between\nTRβ and BTBPE and the subsequent thyroid-disrupting effects.\nThese results facilitate further environmental risk assessment of\nBTBPE."

      "text": "We used BTBPE (CAS no. 37853-59-1;\n99%) from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), 3,3′,5-Triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) (CAS no. 6893-02-3, >98%) from Tokyo Chemical\nIndustry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), 13C-PCB208 (CAS no.\n234432-92-9; ≥98%), an internal standard, from Cambridge Isotope\nLaboratories (Andover, U.S.A.), methanesulfonate (MS-222, CAS: 886-86-2)\nand dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (>99.9%) from Sigma-Aldrich (St.\nLouis,\nMO, U.S.A.). All other chemical reagents were analytical or chromatography\ngrade. We used molecular docking to explore the interaction between BTBPE\nand zebrafish TRs (TRα, TRβ) as detailed in previous studies.29 The zebrafish thyroid hormone receptor protein\nstructure was predicted using homology modeling through the Build\nHomology model procedure in Discovery Studio 2016 software (Accelrys\nSoftware Inc., U.S.A.). We chose the conformation with the lowest\nCDOCKER energy for the binding site. It was identified to calculate\nthe binding energy, which was utilized to evaluate zebrafish TR affinity\nfor BTBPE and T3 (the positive control). Details of the procedure\nare provided in Supporting Information (SI Text S1). The recombinant\nyeast two-hybrid assay that rapidly screens for TR disruption potential\nwas conducted following a previously described method.22 Yeast cells were grown in SD/-Leu/-Trp medium\nat 30 °C for 24 h. For the agonistic activity assay, the cells\nwere exposed to BTBPE (0, 125, 250, 500, 1000 nmol/L) for 2.5 h and\nT3 (500 nmol/L) was coexposed with BTBPE to measure antagonistic activity.\nFollowing lysis with chloroform, the reaction was started by adding o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, after\n1 h, it was stopped by adding sodium carbonate. The β-galactosidase\nactivity (U) was quantified at a 420 nm wavelength (OD420) (TECAN GENios A-5002, Salzburg, Austria). All assays were conducted\nthree times using three samples for each assay. The T-Screen assay\nfor rapid screening of thyroid endocrine disruption\nuses a rat pituitary tumor cell line (GH3). It works through a specific,\nhigh-affinity thyroid receptor (TR) pathway, stimulating the synthesis\nand secretion of growth hormone (GH) to facilitate cell proliferation.30 We obtained GH3 cells from the National Experimental\nCell Resource Sharing Platform (Beijing, China). Cells were maintained\nat 37 °C and 5% CO2 exposure using Ham’s F-12K\n(Kaighn’s) medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS; provided by Gibco, LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.),\n15% horse serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At 24 h, we replaced\nthis medium with a serum-free medium to starve the cells for 24 h\nbefore BTBPE exposure (0, 1.5, 15, 150, 1000, 1500 nmol/L) for 96\nh. Antagonistic activity was measured using T3 (1, 10, 25 nmol/L)\nfor coexposure with BTBPE. Cell viability was determined by observing\nthe colorimetric transformation of WST-8 into formazan using the Cell\nCounting Kit-8 (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) with the formazan wavelength\nof 490 ± (OD490). All assays were repeated three times,\nwith each exposure including a blank and a solvent control (0.1% v/v\nDMSO). The mature zebrafish (wild-type, AB strain) were cultured and embryonic\nexposure was conducted according to a previously documented method.23 We randomly selected 400 fertilized embryos\n(2 h post fertilization, hpf) and placed them in a glass beaker with\n200 mL of BTBPE solution (0, 1, 3, 10 μg/L). We administered\n0.1% (v/v) DMSO to the control and treatment groups. The exposure\ntime for four replicates was 14 days. The exposure solution was refreshed\ndaily and temperature was maintained at 28 ± 0.5 °C, following\na 14/10 h light/dark cycle. Twice daily, zebrafish larvae were nourished\nwith egg yolk and cultured Artemia. Developmental\nindices, including hatching, survival, heart rate, and body length,\nwere recorded. At 14 days post fertilization (dpf), we collected and\nanesthetized larvae using 0.03% MS-222 (300 mg/L), then froze them\nin liquid nitrogen with subsequent preservation at −80 °C\nfor future analysis. These procedures followed the Guidelines for\nthe Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Hydrobiology,\nChinese Academy of Sciences. BTBPE concentrations in the exposure\nsolutions and larvae (14 dpf, n = 4 replicates)\nwere measured following a previously described method.31 We used an Agilent 7890B-7000c gas chromatography–mass\nspectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify BTBPE. We used 13C-PCB\n208 as the internal standard. The limit of detection (LOD) (defined\nas 3-fold the signal/noise ratio) and the limit of quantification\n(LOQ) were 3 μg/L and 10 μg/L, respectively. The recovery\nrate of BTBPE was 97.5 ± 6.9% in exposure solution, and 102.9\n± 7.9% in larvae, respectively. The sample pretreatment, analysis,\nquality assurance, and quality control (QA/QC) are available in the SI (Text S2). Extraction of whole-body larval TH (14 dpf, 200\nlarvae per sample, n = 4 replicates) was based on\na previous method.23 Details are provided\nin SI (Text S3). T4, T3, CRH, and TSH were\nmeasured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (T4, T3: Cloud-Clone\nCorp, Wuhan, China; CRH, TSH: Keygentec, Nanjing, China) according\nto the manufacturer’s instructions. The detection limits for\nT4, T3, CRH, and TSH were 1.29 ng/mL, 50.5 pg/mL, 0.5 ng/mL, and 0.2\nmU/L, respectively, as indicated by the manufacturer. The intra-assay\nvariations and the interassay variations reported by the manufacturer\nare below 10% and 12% for all hormones, respectively. The hormone\nconcentrations were normalized against protein content using a commercial\nkit utilizing the Bradford method (Keygentec, Nanjing, China). We measured the\ntranscription of select genes related to thyroid hormone synthesis,\ntransport, regulation, and metabolism in the HPT axis of zebrafish\nlarvae. We used RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan) to extract total\nRNA from homogenized whole larvae fish (14 dpf; 100 larvae; n = 4 replicates). Following previously described protocols,\nwe extracted and purified total RNA, synthesized first-strand cDNA,\nand conducted quantitative real-time PCRs.23 We obtained the primer sequences of the target genes from a previous\nstudy (SI Table S1).23 Real-time PCR results were determined by threshold cycle\n(Ct) number and gene transcription levels\nwere normalized using the 2–ΔΔCt method with β-actin used\nas a housekeeping gene. We monitored\nspontaneous locomotion and phototaxis. Embryos (22–25 hpf)\nwere selected and video-recorded for 1 min using a CCD camera (Nikon,\nJapan) to count the number of tail swings per embryo as a measure\nof spontaneous movement.32 We used 60 embryos\nin each treatment group from four replicates for data analysis. We conducted phototaxis assays (swimming from dark to light areas)\nat 5 dpf using a previously described method.33 An opaque black acrylic box (10.5 × 3 × 4 cm3 in length × width × height) was separated into chamber\nA and chamber B with a sliding partition in the middle. We placed\n24 randomly selected larvae per replicate (n = 4\nreplicates) in chamber B with the partition closed for 5 min under\ndarkness. After removing the partition, the chamber B remained in\nthe dark and the chamber A were exposed to 200 lx of ambient light.\nAfter 1 min, we reclosed the partition, subsequently counted zebrafish\nin chamber A and B. The chamber structure is provided in SI (Figure S1). We monitored 14 dpf larvae\nfor the locomotion behavior assay using\nthe Zebralab Video-Track system (ViewPoint Life Sciences Inc., Montreal,\nCanada), following a previous method.32 Normal zebrafish larvae were moved into a 24-well plate (one larvae/well).\nFollowing 5 min of adaptation, we measured larval locomotion in 5\nmin dark-5 min light-5 min dark cycles and monitored swimming speed\nusing 48 larvae per treatment from four replicates. The movement frequency\nand distance were recorded every 30 s. All locomotion behavior experiments\nwere conducted at 28 °C. All values are\nexpressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were\nverified for normality using Shapiro–Wilk’s test and\nfor homogeneity of variance using Levene’s test. One-way analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) with least significant difference (LSD) posthoc\nassessed statistical significance. We used SPSS software v22.0 (IBM,\nU.S.A.) for statistical analysis and GraphPad Prism 8.0 (Avenida,\nCA, U.S.A.) software to generate figures. A p-value\nless than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Molecular docking explores\nthe interaction between xenobiotics\nand target receptors, determines their toxicological mode of action,29 and was a critical step in determining the affinity\nof BTBPE for TRs in this study. BTBPE docked with TR isoforms (i.e.,\nTRα and TRβ) by fitting into the active pocket and engaging\nin interactions such as π–π stacking, π-anion,\nπ-alkyl, and alkyl with distinct amino acids. Other BFRs, e.g.,\ntetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) has been proved to dock with TR-LBD\n(ligand binding domain) through π-alkyl, alkyl interactions.34 Having evidence that BTBPE can bind with zebrafish\nTRαβ LBD such as T3 suggested that BTBPE was a potential\nTR agonist. The in vitro rapid screening assay revealed thyroid\nendocrine potential\nvia TR signaling pathway. In the recombinant TRβ two-hybrid\nyeast assay, increased β-galactosidase activity indicated that\nBTBPE activates the TR signaling-mediated pathway toward agonistic\nactivities. The effects of thyroid disruptors, e.g., TBBPA35 and hydroxylated polybrominated biphenyls (OH-PBBs),36 have been demonstrated. We further evaluated\nthe antagonistic activity of BTBPE when coincubated with T3. Co-administration\nof BTBPE with T3 shows a marked inhibition of β-galactosidase\nactivity relative to T3 treatment, indicating BTBPE disruption of\nthe thyroid endocrine system through the TR regulatory system. Futhermore,\nexposure to BTBPE increased GH3 cell proliferation in the T-Screen\nassay, whereas it was inhibited when coexposed with T3, indicating\nits agonist potential via TR pathway.37 GH3 cells possess many enzymes, such as TRs, TSH, and deiodinase,\nand its proliferation sensitive to T3 level.38,39 Hence, GH3 cell proliferation rate may better predict agonistic/antagonistic\nactivity of chemicals that have thyroid endocrine potential. The T-Screen\ntest effectively anticipates the impact of specific chemicals that\ndisrupt thyroid hormones, including BFRs, polychlorinated biphenyls\n(PCBs), and pentachlorophenol, by measuring cell proliferation rate.40,41 We found that both yeast and T-Screening assays are useful for predicting\nthyroid endocrine disruption potential via TR-mediated signaling for\nBTBPE. Decreased T4 was observed in BTBPE exposure groups, but\nnot in\nthe T3. Previous studies have indicated that circulating T3 does not\nchange with decreased T4 level after exposure to thyroid endocrine-disrupting\nchemicals, such as penta-BDEs mixture (DE-71), 2,2′,4,4’5-pentain\npolybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-99), and decabromodiphenyl ether\n(BDE-209),42−44 suggesting that decreased T4 does not limit the T3\nsupply to the plasma pool, and such regulation mechanism is crucial\nfor maintaining homeostasis. Studies have shown that the impact of\nthyroid endocrine-disrupting activity on T3 levels is unremarkable\ncompared to its effects on T4 levels in rodents and fish.45,46 This suggests that T4 response is more sensitive than T3 response\nto thyroid chemicals stimulation. Increased T4 levels were reported\nin bromoacetamide and DE-7147 and NBFRs.\nZebrafish larvae exposure to DBDPE,23 or\n3,3′,5,5′-Tetrabromobiphenyl (BB80) for 14 days significantly\nincreased T4 level.48 The divergence in\nreported T4 change may depend on chemical characteristics exposure\ntime, model species, and exposure route or concentrations. Exposing\nzebrafish larvae to DE-71 for 14 days reduces T4, whereas long-term\nexposure of DE-71 to adult zebrafish increases T4.42,47 We found that BTBPE is similar to penta-BDE in how it disrupts thyroid\nhormones levels. Concentrations of TSH and CRH were increased\nvia a negative feedback\nmechanism regulating the HPT axis, where the secretion of TSH by the\npituitary gland controls the synthesis and release of T4 by the thyroid\nfollicles. This mechanism allows for response-regulated change in\nT4 level. CRH promotes TSH secretion in nonmammalian vertebrates like\namphibians and fish,49 suggesting its potential\nrole as a universal controller of the thyroidal axis. In this scenario,\nelevated CRH and TSH levels are crucial parts of a negative feedback\nmechanism that compensates for reduced TH. Hence, we evaluated the\ngene transcription profiles associated with the HPT axis, and observed\nincreased transcription of tg and tpo genes with BTBPE treatment. The transcription of tg and tpo are involved in TH synthesis.50 Zebrafish larvae exposed to various chemical\ncontaminants (such as BDE-209, DE-71, benzophenone) shown increased\ntranscription of these genes,accompanied by decreased T4 levels.38,42,44 Other studies have shown decreased tg and tpo gene transcription and increased\nT4 levels after exposure to pentabromoethylbenzene.25 Thus, the upregulation of these gene transcription in response\nto reduced T4 levels may be compensatory. The ttr gene transcription only decreased in the highest BTBPE exposure\ngroup. The transport of TH involves ttr as does the\nregulation of TH supply to different target tissues in fish.51 Derivatives and metabolites of PCBs and phenol\ncompounds that share a structure similar to THs may influence circulating\nTH levels in vertebrates by competing for binding sites on transport\nproteins.52 When exposure to BTBPE decreases ttr gene transcription, it reduces the TTR available for\nbinding to TH. As a result, the unbound T4 is more susceptible to\nliver catabolism, increased elimination, and reduced TH circulation.\nSimilarly, exposure to DE-71 reduced ttr transcription\nmeanwhile decreasing T4 level.44 We observed\na concentration-dependent upregulation of the ugt1ab gene. Its enzyme activity affects TH metabolism by modifying T4\nlevel, via glucuronidation, for excretion through bile.53 It can decrease TH levels through T4 glucuronidation\nin both animal and in vitro models.38 The\nBTBPE-triggered increase in ugt1ab transcription\nmay amplify thyroid hormone elimination, ultimately leading to reduced\nTH levels in zebrafish larvae. Deiodinase genes transcription\nwas decreased in dio2, dio3a, and dio3b, but unchanged\nin dio1. Deiodinases regulate TH levels in plasma\nand peripheral tissue, and deiodinase gene transcription is influenced\nby TH levels in turn.49 For example, higher\nlevels of TH reduce dio2 transcription and lower\nlevels increase it.54 In addition, higher\nlevels of TH increase dio3 transcription whereas\nlower levels and normal physiological conditions decrease it. However,\nsuch rules are not entirely consistent with the disruptions caused\nby toxicants. For example, in rats exposed to hexachlorobenzene, dio1 increased but circulating T4 and dio2 transcription decreased.55 Walleye (Sander vitreus) treated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals\nhave elevated dio2 transcription, T3, and\nT4 levels, whereas the hepatic mRNA of dio1 and dio3 remained unchanged.56 In\nrats given PCB153, T4 dropped and dio2 gene transcription\nwas suppressed but there was no discernible effect on the dio1 or dio3 genes.57 Other studies found that zebrafish larvae exposed to DBDPE\nfor 14 days had increased T4 and T3 levels, reduced dio1, and elevated dio2, dio3a, and dio3b gene transcription.23 Gene\ntranscription of deiodinases occurs in a cell or tissue type-specific\nmanner suggesting that there is a divergent molecular transcript response\nto the thyroid endocrine disruption chemicals. This is more complex\nthan a secondary reaction to changed TH levels.54,58 We have no evidence if toxicants alter deiodinase activity in TH-targeted\ntissues or if deiodinase activity is the primary or secondary result\nof toxicant exposure.54 Zebrafish\nlocomotion is an established end point for evaluating\nthe effect of environmental pollutants on developmental neurotoxicity.32 Our study indicated that BTBPE causes developmental\nneurotoxicity in that it suppresses spontaneous movement, swimming\nactivity, and visual acuity. This is consistent with another study\nindicating that PBDEs exposure can reduce movement and impairs visual\nacuity.59 Because TH plays a vital role\nin brain development, any disruptions in TH balance may impair neurological\ndevelopment.60 PBDEs inhibit nervous system\ndevelopment by altering TH levels.61 Previous\nstudies have shown that exposure to PBDEs impairs locomotion in embryonic\nand larval zebrafish.62 Other studies have\nsuggested that thyroid hormone signaling participates in early eye\ndevelopment and regulation of photoreceptor patterns.16,59,63 Hence, thyroid signaling disturbances\ncaused by BTBPE may disrupt retinal development and neural function."

Increased use of 1,2-bis (2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE),\na typical NBFR, has created widespread environmental contamination.1,2 It has been detected in air,3 dust,4 soils,5 sediments,6 sludge, and surface water.7 Due to their highly hydrophobicity, BTBPE is seldom analyzed\nin surface water and up to 5.22 ng/L has been reported.8 However, like PBDEs, BTBPE shows environmental\npersistence and potential for bioaccumulation.1,9 It\nis present in mud carp (Cirrhinus molitorella) (518\n± 277 ng/g l.w.), crucian carp (Carassius auratus) (332 ± 315 ng/g l.w.),10 and shark\nlivers (up to 16.7 ng/g l.w.).11 BTBPE\nhas been shown in the food web of the South China Sea tropics.12 It has been detected in breast milk13 and human serum.14 The widespread presence of BTBPE indicates the need for the study\nof its environmental effects and potential toxicity. Thyroid\nhormones (THs) are vital to growth, development, metabolism,\nand energy expenditure, but are especially important in the early\ndevelopment of vertebrates.15 THs homeostasis\nis sensitive to many environmental toxicants, and can be affected\nby thyroid gland development, THs synthesis and transportation, liver\nelimination, and hypothalamus-pituitary feedback regulation.16 Transthyretin (TTR), deiodinases, and thyroid\nreceptors (TRs) have been implicated in thyroid endocrine disruption.15,17 The bioactive form of TH is T3, which interacts with TRs at tissue-specific\neffects.18,19 The predominant thyroid isoform, TRβ,\nhas a key role in the regulation of target gene transcription.20 Its interaction with thyroid endocrine disrupting\nchemicals leads to abnormal TH levels and activity.21,22 Thyroid endocrine disruptions can be caused by NBFRs, such as bis(2-ethylhexyl)\ntetrabromophthalate (TBPH),19 decabromodiphenyl\nethane (DBDPE),23,24 and pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB).25 Given that the structure of BTBPE is similar\nto that of PBDEs and TH,9 its potential\nthyroid endocrine disruptions are well worth exploring. Limited toxicological\nstudies have shown that BTBPE exposure may impair thyroid function.\nChicken eggs exposed to BTBPE have decreased type III iodothyronine\n5′-deiodinase (Dio3) gene transcription,26 whereas embryonic exposure to BTBPE in the American\nkestrel (Falco sparverius) inhibits type 2 deiodinase\n(Dio2) activity.27 One\nstudy showed a positive correlation between the BTBPE found in dust\nand human T3 levels suggesting thyroid endocrine disruption.28 The thyroid-disrupting effects of BTBPE are\nnot well-researched nor are the related mechanisms. Given its\nincreased use and potential risk to wildlife and humans,\nexploring BTBPE and its effects on the thyroid endocrine system and\nhuman and environmental health is warranted. We evaluated the thyroid-disrupting\neffects of BTBPE as follows: (1) Molecular docking in silico identified\naffinity and interactions between BTBPE and TRs; (2) In vitro recombinant\nyeast two-hybrid and T-Screen assays were used for rapid screening\nof thyroid-disrupting potentials; (3) BTBPE was tested for thyroid-disrupting\nactivity using zebrafish larvae; and (4) The locomotion of zebrafish\nlarvae was examined to assess developmental neurotoxicity. This is\nthe first in silico and in vitro evidence of the interaction between\nTRβ and BTBPE and the subsequent thyroid-disrupting effects.\nThese results facilitate further environmental risk assessment of\nBTBPE.\n\n## Materials and Methods\nWe used BTBPE (CAS no. 37853-59-1;\n99%) from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), 3,3′,5-Triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) (CAS no. 6893-02-3, >98%) from Tokyo Chemical\nIndustry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), 13C-PCB208 (CAS no.\n234432-92-9; ≥98%), an internal standard, from Cambridge Isotope\nLaboratories (Andover, U.S.A.), methanesulfonate (MS-222, CAS: 886-86-2)\nand dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (>99.9%) from Sigma-Aldrich (St.\nLouis,\nMO, U.S.A.). All other chemical reagents were analytical or chromatography\ngrade. We used molecular docking to explore the interaction between BTBPE\nand zebrafish TRs (TRα, TRβ) as detailed in previous studies.29 The zebrafish thyroid hormone receptor protein\nstructure was predicted using homology modeling through the Build\nHomology model procedure in Discovery Studio 2016 software (Accelrys\nSoftware Inc., U.S.A.). We chose the conformation with the lowest\nCDOCKER energy for the binding site. It was identified to calculate\nthe binding energy, which was utilized to evaluate zebrafish TR affinity\nfor BTBPE and T3 (the positive control). Details of the procedure\nare provided in Supporting Information (SI Text S1). The recombinant\nyeast two-hybrid assay that rapidly screens for TR disruption potential\nwas conducted following a previously described method.22 Yeast cells were grown in SD/-Leu/-Trp medium\nat 30 °C for 24 h. For the agonistic activity assay, the cells\nwere exposed to BTBPE (0, 125, 250, 500, 1000 nmol/L) for 2.5 h and\nT3 (500 nmol/L) was coexposed with BTBPE to measure antagonistic activity.\nFollowing lysis with chloroform, the reaction was started by adding o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, after\n1 h, it was stopped by adding sodium carbonate. The β-galactosidase\nactivity (U) was quantified at a 420 nm wavelength (OD420) (TECAN GENios A-5002, Salzburg, Austria). All assays were conducted\nthree times using three samples for each assay. The T-Screen assay\nfor rapid screening of thyroid endocrine disruption\nuses a rat pituitary tumor cell line (GH3). It works through a specific,\nhigh-affinity thyroid receptor (TR) pathway, stimulating the synthesis\nand secretion of growth hormone (GH) to facilitate cell proliferation.30 We obtained GH3 cells from the National Experimental\nCell Resource Sharing Platform (Beijing, China). Cells were maintained\nat 37 °C and 5% CO2 exposure using Ham’s F-12K\n(Kaighn’s) medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS; provided by Gibco, LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.),\n15% horse serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At 24 h, we replaced\nthis medium with a serum-free medium to starve the cells for 24 h\nbefore BTBPE exposure (0, 1.5, 15, 150, 1000, 1500 nmol/L) for 96\nh. Antagonistic activity was measured using T3 (1, 10, 25 nmol/L)\nfor coexposure with BTBPE. Cell viability was determined by observing\nthe colorimetric transformation of WST-8 into formazan using the Cell\nCounting Kit-8 (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) with the formazan wavelength\nof 490 ± (OD490). All assays were repeated three times,\nwith each exposure including a blank and a solvent control (0.1% v/v\nDMSO). The mature zebrafish (wild-type, AB strain) were cultured and embryonic\nexposure was conducted according to a previously documented method.23 We randomly selected 400 fertilized embryos\n(2 h post fertilization, hpf) and placed them in a glass beaker with\n200 mL of BTBPE solution (0, 1, 3, 10 μg/L). We administered\n0.1% (v/v) DMSO to the control and treatment groups. The exposure\ntime for four replicates was 14 days. The exposure solution was refreshed\ndaily and temperature was maintained at 28 ± 0.5 °C, following\na 14/10 h light/dark cycle. Twice daily, zebrafish larvae were nourished\nwith egg yolk and cultured Artemia. Developmental\nindices, including hatching, survival, heart rate, and body length,\nwere recorded. At 14 days post fertilization (dpf), we collected and\nanesthetized larvae using 0.03% MS-222 (300 mg/L), then froze them\nin liquid nitrogen with subsequent preservation at −80 °C\nfor future analysis. These procedures followed the Guidelines for\nthe Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute of Hydrobiology,\nChinese Academy of Sciences. BTBPE concentrations in the exposure\nsolutions and larvae (14 dpf, n = 4 replicates)\nwere measured following a previously described method.31 We used an Agilent 7890B-7000c gas chromatography–mass\nspectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify BTBPE. We used 13C-PCB\n208 as the internal standard. The limit of detection (LOD) (defined\nas 3-fold the signal/noise ratio) and the limit of quantification\n(LOQ) were 3 μg/L and 10 μg/L, respectively. The recovery\nrate of BTBPE was 97.5 ± 6.9% in exposure solution, and 102.9\n± 7.9% in larvae, respectively. The sample pretreatment, analysis,\nquality assurance, and quality control (QA/QC) are available in the SI (Text S2). Extraction of whole-body larval TH (14 dpf, 200\nlarvae per sample, n = 4 replicates) was based on\na previous method.23 Details are provided\nin SI (Text S3). T4, T3, CRH, and TSH were\nmeasured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (T4, T3: Cloud-Clone\nCorp, Wuhan, China; CRH, TSH: Keygentec, Nanjing, China) according\nto the manufacturer’s instructions. The detection limits for\nT4, T3, CRH, and TSH were 1.29 ng/mL, 50.5 pg/mL, 0.5 ng/mL, and 0.2\nmU/L, respectively, as indicated by the manufacturer. The intra-assay\nvariations and the interassay variations reported by the manufacturer\nare below 10% and 12% for all hormones, respectively. The hormone\nconcentrations were normalized against protein content using a commercial\nkit utilizing the Bradford method (Keygentec, Nanjing, China). We measured the\ntranscription of select genes related to thyroid hormone synthesis,\ntransport, regulation, and metabolism in the HPT axis of zebrafish\nlarvae. We used RNAiso Plus (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan) to extract total\nRNA from homogenized whole larvae fish (14 dpf; 100 larvae; n = 4 replicates). Following previously described protocols,\nwe extracted and purified total RNA, synthesized first-strand cDNA,\nand conducted quantitative real-time PCRs.23 We obtained the primer sequences of the target genes from a previous\nstudy (SI Table S1).23 Real-time PCR results were determined by threshold cycle\n(Ct) number and gene transcription levels\nwere normalized using the 2–ΔΔCt method with β-actin used\nas a housekeeping gene. We monitored\nspontaneous locomotion and phototaxis. Embryos (22–25 hpf)\nwere selected and video-recorded for 1 min using a CCD camera (Nikon,\nJapan) to count the number of tail swings per embryo as a measure\nof spontaneous movement.32 We used 60 embryos\nin each treatment group from four replicates for data analysis. We conducted phototaxis assays (swimming from dark to light areas)\nat 5 dpf using a previously described method.33 An opaque black acrylic box (10.5 × 3 × 4 cm3 in length × width × height) was separated into chamber\nA and chamber B with a sliding partition in the middle. We placed\n24 randomly selected larvae per replicate (n = 4\nreplicates) in chamber B with the partition closed for 5 min under\ndarkness. After removing the partition, the chamber B remained in\nthe dark and the chamber A were exposed to 200 lx of ambient light.\nAfter 1 min, we reclosed the partition, subsequently counted zebrafish\nin chamber A and B. The chamber structure is provided in SI (Figure S1). We monitored 14 dpf larvae\nfor the locomotion behavior assay using\nthe Zebralab Video-Track system (ViewPoint Life Sciences Inc., Montreal,\nCanada), following a previous method.32 Normal zebrafish larvae were moved into a 24-well plate (one larvae/well).\nFollowing 5 min of adaptation, we measured larval locomotion in 5\nmin dark-5 min light-5 min dark cycles and monitored swimming speed\nusing 48 larvae per treatment from four replicates. The movement frequency\nand distance were recorded every 30 s. All locomotion behavior experiments\nwere conducted at 28 °C. All values are\nexpressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data were\nverified for normality using Shapiro–Wilk’s test and\nfor homogeneity of variance using Levene’s test. One-way analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) with least significant difference (LSD) posthoc\nassessed statistical significance. We used SPSS software v22.0 (IBM,\nU.S.A.) for statistical analysis and GraphPad Prism 8.0 (Avenida,\nCA, U.S.A.) software to generate figures. A p-value\nless than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Reagents\nWe used BTBPE (CAS no. 37853-59-1;\n99%) from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), 3,3′,5-Triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) (CAS no. 6893-02-3, >98%) from Tokyo Chemical\nIndustry Co., Ltd.

The interaction\nenergies of T3\nwith TRα and TRβ were −60.16 and −58.2282\nkcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, T3 and TRα hydrogen bonds\nwere formed with residues GLY315, ARG265, MET296, and HIS418 and between\nT3 and TRβ with residues ARG256 and THR312 (Figure S3). Optimal BTBPE conformations with TRα and\nTRβ are shown in Figures 1A and 1B. The docking interaction energies\nfor BTBPE with TRα and TRβ are −36.4005 and −30.6469\nkcal/mol, respectively. Figure 1C shows π–π and π-alkyl bonds formed\nbetween BTBPE and TRα with residues HIS193 and ILE390, respectively.\nBTBPE interactions with TRβ include π-anion at ASP324\nand π-alkyl and alkyl at HIS195, TRP196, and VAL327, respectively\n(Figure 1D).

BTBPE docked with TR isoforms (i.e.,\nTRα and TRβ) by fitting into the active pocket and engaging\nin interactions such as π–π stacking, π-anion,\nπ-alkyl, and alkyl with distinct amino acids. Other BFRs, e.g.,\ntetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) has been proved to dock with TR-LBD\n(ligand binding domain) through π-alkyl, alkyl interactions.34 Having evidence that BTBPE can bind with zebrafish\nTRαβ LBD such as T3 suggested that BTBPE was a potential\nTR agonist. The in vitro rapid screening assay revealed thyroid\nendocrine potential\nvia TR signaling pathway. In the recombinant TRβ two-hybrid\nyeast assay, increased β-galactosidase activity indicated that\nBTBPE activates the TR signaling-mediated pathway toward agonistic\nactivities. The effects of thyroid disruptors, e.g., TBBPA35 and hydroxylated polybrominated biphenyls (OH-PBBs),36 have been demonstrated. We further evaluated\nthe antagonistic activity of BTBPE when coincubated with T3. Co-administration\nof BTBPE with T3 shows a marked inhibition of β-galactosidase\nactivity relative to T3 treatment, indicating BTBPE disruption of\nthe thyroid endocrine system through the TR regulatory system. Futhermore,\nexposure to BTBPE increased GH3 cell proliferation in the T-Screen\nassay, whereas it was inhibited when coexposed with T3, indicating\nits agonist potential via TR pathway.37 GH3 cells possess many enzymes, such as TRs, TSH, and deiodinase,\nand its proliferation sensitive to T3 level.38,39 Hence, GH3 cell proliferation rate may better predict agonistic/antagonistic\nactivity of chemicals that have thyroid endocrine potential. The T-Screen\ntest effectively anticipates the impact of specific chemicals that\ndisrupt thyroid hormones, including BFRs, polychlorinated biphenyls\n(PCBs), and pentachlorophenol, by measuring cell proliferation rate.40,41 We found that both yeast and T-Screening assays are useful for predicting\nthyroid endocrine disruption potential via TR-mediated signaling for\nBTBPE. Decreased T4 was observed in BTBPE exposure groups, but\nnot in\nthe T3. Previous studies have indicated that circulating T3 does not\nchange with decreased T4 level after exposure to thyroid endocrine-disrupting\nchemicals, such as penta-BDEs mixture (DE-71), 2,2′,4,4’5-pentain\npolybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-99), and decabromodiphenyl ether\n(BDE-209),42−44 suggesting that decreased T4 does not limit the T3\nsupply to the plasma pool, and such regulation mechanism is crucial\nfor maintaining homeostasis. Studies have shown that the impact of\nthyroid endocrine-disrupting activity on T3 levels is unremarkable\ncompared to its effects on T4 levels in rodents and fish.45,46 This suggests that T4 response is more sensitive than T3 response\nto thyroid chemicals stimulation. Increased T4 levels were reported\nin bromoacetamide and DE-7147 and NBFRs.\nZebrafish larvae exposure to DBDPE,23 or\n3,3′,5,5′-Tetrabromobiphenyl (BB80) for 14 days significantly\nincreased T4 level.48 The divergence in\nreported T4 change may depend on chemical characteristics exposure\ntime, model species, and exposure route or concentrations. Exposing\nzebrafish larvae to DE-71 for 14 days reduces T4, whereas long-term\nexposure of DE-71 to adult zebrafish increases T4.42,47 We found that BTBPE is similar to penta-BDE in how it disrupts thyroid\nhormones levels. Concentrations of TSH and CRH were increased\nvia a negative feedback\nmechanism regulating the HPT axis, where the secretion of TSH by the\npituitary gland controls the synthesis and release of T4 by the thyroid\nfollicles. This mechanism allows for response-regulated change in\nT4 level. CRH promotes TSH secretion in nonmammalian vertebrates like\namphibians and fish,49 suggesting its potential\nrole as a universal controller of the thyroidal axis. In this scenario,\nelevated CRH and TSH levels are crucial parts of a negative feedback\nmechanism that compensates for reduced TH. Hence, we evaluated the\ngene transcription profiles associated with the HPT axis, and observed\nincreased transcription of tg and tpo genes with BTBPE treatment. The transcription of tg and tpo are involved in TH synthesis.50 Zebrafish larvae exposed to various chemical\ncontaminants (such as BDE-209, DE-71, benzophenone) shown increased\ntranscription of these genes,accompanied by decreased T4 levels.38,42,44 Other studies have shown decreased tg and tpo gene transcription and increased\nT4 levels after exposure to pentabromoethylbenzene.25 Thus, the upregulation of these gene transcription in response\nto reduced T4 levels may be compensatory. The ttr gene transcription only decreased in the highest BTBPE exposure\ngroup. The transport of TH involves ttr as does the\nregulation of TH supply to different target tissues in fish.51 Derivatives and metabolites of PCBs and phenol\ncompounds that share a structure similar to THs may influence circulating\nTH levels in vertebrates by competing for binding sites on transport\nproteins.52 When exposure to BTBPE decreases ttr gene transcription, it reduces the TTR available for\nbinding to TH. As a result, the unbound T4 is more susceptible to\nliver catabolism, increased elimination, and reduced TH circulation.\nSimilarly, exposure to DE-71 reduced ttr transcription\nmeanwhile decreasing T4 level.44 We observed\na concentration-dependent upregulation of the ugt1ab gene. Its enzyme activity affects TH metabolism by modifying T4\nlevel, via glucuronidation, for excretion through bile.53 It can decrease TH levels through T4 glucuronidation\nin both animal and in vitro models.38 The\nBTBPE-triggered increase in ugt1ab transcription\nmay amplify thyroid hormone elimination, ultimately leading to reduced\nTH levels in zebrafish larvae. Deiodinase genes transcription\nwas decreased in dio2, dio3a, and dio3b, but unchanged\nin dio1. Deiodinases regulate TH levels in plasma\nand peripheral tissue, and deiodinase gene transcription is influenced\nby TH levels in turn.49 For example, higher\nlevels of TH reduce dio2 transcription and lower\nlevels increase it.54 In addition, higher\nlevels of TH increase dio3 transcription whereas\nlower levels and normal physiological conditions decrease it. However,\nsuch rules are not entirely consistent with the disruptions caused\nby toxicants. For example, in rats exposed to hexachlorobenzene, dio1 increased but circulating T4 and dio2 transcription decreased.55 Walleye (Sander vitreus) treated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals\nhave elevated dio2 transcription, T3, and\nT4 levels, whereas the hepatic mRNA of dio1 and dio3 remained unchanged.56 In\nrats given PCB153, T4 dropped and dio2 gene transcription\nwas suppressed but there was no discernible effect on the dio1 or dio3 genes.57 Other studies found that zebrafish larvae exposed to DBDPE\nfor 14 days had increased T4 and T3 levels, reduced dio1, and elevated dio2, dio3a, and dio3b gene transcription.23 Gene\ntranscription of deiodinases occurs in a cell or tissue type-specific\nmanner suggesting that there is a divergent molecular transcript response\nto the thyroid endocrine disruption chemicals. This is more complex\nthan a secondary reaction to changed TH levels.54,58 We have no evidence if toxicants alter deiodinase activity in TH-targeted\ntissues or if deiodinase activity is the primary or secondary result\nof toxicant exposure.54 Zebrafish\nlocomotion is an established end point for evaluating\nthe effect of environmental pollutants on developmental neurotoxicity.32 Our study indicated that BTBPE causes developmental\nneurotoxicity in that it suppresses spontaneous movement, swimming\nactivity, and visual acuity. This is consistent with another study\nindicating that PBDEs exposure can reduce movement and impairs visual\nacuity.59 Because TH plays a vital role\nin brain development, any disruptions in TH balance may impair neurological\ndevelopment.60 PBDEs inhibit nervous system\ndevelopment by altering TH levels.61 Previous\nstudies have shown that exposure to PBDEs impairs locomotion in embryonic\nand larval zebrafish.62 Other studies have\nsuggested that thyroid hormone signaling participates in early eye\ndevelopment and regulation of photoreceptor patterns.16,59,63 Hence, thyroid signaling disturbances\ncaused by BTBPE may disrupt retinal development and neural function.\n\n## Conclusions\nThis study first determined\nthat exposure\nto BTBPE leads to thyroid\ndysfunction and in neurotoxicity in developing fish. For better understanding\nof the adverse health impacts and assessing environmental risks of\nBTBPE, future research should investigate the BTBPE toxicokinetics\nand tissue distribution in organisms, how BTBPE acts on the thyroid\nsystem, and if exposure to environmentally relevant BTBPE concentrations\nimpacts organism health. In addition, given the critical function\nof thyroid hormones in the early development of the central nervous\nsystem, there is also a need to investigate the effects of BTBPE on\nneurons.",
