  "abstract": "IntroductionPublic and occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields due to the growing trend of electronic devices may cause adverse effects on human health. This paper describes the risk of mutation and sexual trauma and infertility in masculine sexual cell by mobile phone radiations.MethodsIn this study, we measured the emitted dose from a radiofrequency device, such as switching high voltage at different frequencies using a scintillation detector. The switching high voltage power supply (HVPS) was built for the Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) system. For radiation dosimetry, we used an ALNOR scintillator that can measure gamma radiation. The simulation was performed by MATLAB software, and data from the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) were used to verify the simulation.ResultsWe investigated the risks that result from the waves, according to a report by International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), to every organ of the body is defined by the beam and electromagnetic radiation from this electronic device on people. The results showed that the maximum personal dose over a 15-min period working at the mentioned HVPS did not exceed 0.31 μSV/h (with an aluminum shield). So, according to other sources of radiation, continuous working time of the system should not be more than 10 hours. Finally, a characteristic curve for secure working with modules at different frequencies was reported. The RF input signal to the body for maximum penetration depth (δ) and electromagnetic energy absorption rate (SAR) of biological tissue were obtained for each tissue.ConclusionThe results of this study and International Commission of Non Ionization Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) reports showed the people who spend more than 50 minutes a day using a cell phone could have early dementia or other thermal damage due to the burning of glucose in the brain.",

      "text": "Many people are not aware of the harmful effects of radiofrequency waves (RF) and their role in cancer and other serious risks. Scientific evidence suggests that cancer is not only linked to mobile phone radiation and that other factors also may be involved in its development. Most mobile operators use from radiofrequency waves in the range up 300 MHz to 3 GHz that can be harmful for human health (1). Many scientific studies have been done on the radiobiological effects of RF waves, and most of them have reported the rare relationship between RF exposure and risks posed by mobile phones on the body in the last 15 years (2). However, they could lead to increased body temperature, especially in the head and neck, who have a low threshold dose and increases the probability of injury if there is long-term exposure to these waves. Mobile phones emit RF waves even when they are in standby mode. When using mobile phones, various factors should be considered, such as the duration, location, and method of use, in order to reduce the possible effects of exposure to radiation in the RF. Because of the risk of mutation and sexual trauma and to prevent infertility due to the effect on male sexual cells, the mobile phone should be away from the waist. In this study, we measured the emitted dose from a radiofrequency device at different frequencies using a scintillation detector. The results of this study and International Commission of Non Ionization Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) reports show that people who use cell phones more than 50 minutes a day face early dementia or other thermal damage due to the burning of glucose in the brain (3). Currently, the ranges of subjects related to occupational and public exposure of electromagnetic fields have been increased. Due to the possibility of adverse effects on human health, performance study of these devices has significant importance (4). There are two types of electromagnetic fields based on the frequency range, i.e., extremely low frequency (ELF) and very low frequency (VLF) fields. ELF and VLF fields’ frequency ranges are between 3 and 300 Hz and 3 and 300 kHz, respectively. Due to the nature of static electricity, electric and magnetic fields at these frequencies operate separately from each other and will be measured in the different circumstances (5). Electric and magnetic fields can be produced by carrying of electric current at any wiring or equipment, such as overhead or underground power lines, home wiring, medical equipment, and electronic devices (6). The most important factors that influence human exposure are power density of the frequency generator source, distance from the source, type and thickness of the exposed beams, and frequency (penetrated depth) of the RF input signal to the body (7). Figure 1 shows the frequency ranges of electromagnetic fields."

It was designed and built for the Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography(SPECT) system, and its performance was evaluted through simulation as well as experiment. The nominal frequency of SHVPS is about 31 kHz that is achieved in half of the duty cycle. Some module specifications, such as the maximum intensity of the magnetic field (Bmax), output voltage (Vo), output current (Io), maximum switching frequency (Fmax), reference voltage (Vr), and bias voltage are Bmax = 200 mT, Vo = 2000 V, Io = 20 mA, Fmax = 60 kHz, Vr = 5.5 V, and Vc = 12 V, respectively. Figure 2 shows the prototype model of the constructed module. In switched mode power supplies, switching frequency interference results in a sudden flow of electric and magnetic fields. Thus, to reduce the effects of interference, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) filters and RF shielding are used. The body exposure that is caused by RF waves of electric and magnetic fields, which varies with the intensity of the output signal was determined. Usually energy measurement of transmitted RF signals that enters the body is not exactly possible. However, it can be estimated and predicted. For quantification of the exposure effects on the human body, the term used is dosimetry (dosimetric quantities). Other quantities related to the exposure of tissue include the electric field strength, the induced current in the body, and the rate of energy absorbed by the external field. The dosimetry role is to evaluate the amount of the induced electric fields in the body. Also, the dosimetry term often is used to connect the body and the biological effects resulting from energy absorption of electromagnetic waves. To measure the absorbed energy in the body by RF wave that was emitted from the HV module, an ALNOR dosimeter was used in this study.

SAR is the time rate at which electromagnetic energy is absorbed in a biological tissue and can be expressed as (9, 10): where σ is specific conductivity S m – 1, Erms is the effective amount of field in tissue, and ρ is the density of the radiation-exposed tissue, which, for the head is 1.027 (gr cm−3).
