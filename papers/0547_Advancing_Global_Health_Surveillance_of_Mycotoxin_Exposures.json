  "abstract": "Mycotoxins are a heterogeneous group of toxins produced\nby fungi\nthat can grow in staple crops (e.g., maize, cereals), resulting in\nhealth risks due to widespread exposure from human consumption and\ninhalation. Dried blood spot (DBS), dried serum spot (DSS), and volumetric\ntip microsampling (VTS) assays were developed and validated for several\nimportant mycotoxins. This review summarizes studies that have developed\nthese assays to monitor mycotoxin exposures in human biological samples\nand highlights future directions to facilitate minimally invasive\nsampling techniques as global public health tools. A systematic search\nof PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase (Elsevier), and CINAHL (EBSCO) was conducted.\nKey assay performance metrics were extracted to provide a critical\nreview of the available methods. This search identified 11 published\nreports related to measuring mycotoxins (ochratoxins, aflatoxins,\nand fumonisins) using DBS/DSS and VTS assays. Multimycotoxin assays\nadapted for DBS/DSS and VTS have undergone sufficient laboratory validation\nfor applications in large-scale population health and human biomonitoring\nstudies. Future work should expand the number of mycotoxins that can\nbe measured in multimycotoxin assays, continue to improve multimycotoxin\nassay sensitivities of several biomarkers with low detection rates,\nand validate multimycotoxin assays across diverse populations with\nvarying exposure levels. Validated low-cost and ultrasensitive minimally\ninvasive sampling methods should be deployed in human biomonitoring\nand public health surveillance studies to guide policy interventions\nto reduce inequities in global mycotoxin exposures.",

      "text": "Despite significant progress in our understanding\nof the health\neffects of mycotoxins over the past 50 years, human exposure to mycotoxins\nhas remained an under-recognized global health issue.1−3 Significant inequities exist in exposures to mycotoxins globally\nwith elevated exposures occurring in many low- and middle-income countries\n(LMICs) with poor legislation and regulatory mechanisms to monitor\nthe food supply chain.1,3−6 Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites\nproduced by fungi and can contaminate food, including maize, cereals,\ngroundnuts, and tree nuts, resulting in widespread exposure due to\ndirect (e.g., consumption of grain-derived foods) and indirect (e.g.,\nmilk or meat from animals with feeds contaminated with mycotoxins)\nhuman consumption.7,8 Animal exposure to mycotoxins\nand carryover effects in humans is succinctly reviewed by Nji et al.8 Human exposure to mycotoxins may also occur in\nthe environment via inhalation.7 Mycotoxins may adversely affect human health and consequently should\nbe incorporated into human biomonitoring (HBM)9 and exposomics studies.10 Among the mycotoxins,\naflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON), and zearalenone\n(ZEA) pose the greatest threats to global health.3,11 The\nEuropean Human Biomonitoring initiative (HBM4 EU) recently labeled\naflatoxin B1 (AFB1), DON, and fumonisin B1 (FB1) as “prioritized chemicals of concern”12 and there is growing interest in monitoring\nand reducing mycotoxin exposure levels globally.4 While much progress has been made in measuring aflatoxin\nexposure biomarkers to understand disease etiology and evaluate public\nhealth interventions to reduce exposures,1,2 there\nremains a paucity of high-quality longitudinal epidemiologic data\non human exposures to most mycotoxins and associated health risks,\nespecially in children.13,14 Although much can be\nattributed to a lack of proper surveillance in many parts of the world,3 the surveillance mechanisms which exist primarily\ninvolve measurements of food contamination (i.e., food sampling) rather\nthan measurements of human exposures (i.e., biological sampling). Populations in many LMICs face higher chronic exposures to mycotoxins\ndue to climate and storage conditions that are conducive to fungal\ngrowth and mycotoxin production (e.g., high heat and humidity), exacerbated\nby poor or nonexistent food surveillance systems.3,15 Rural\nsubsistence farming communities face the greatest exposure risks because\nmany of these communities both produce and consume their own crops\nwithout regulatory oversight.3,8 In addition, climate\nchange is expected to increase human exposure to mycotoxins in many\ngeographic regions,7 including Europe and\nother regions that may experience more extreme weather events, such\nas heat waves and droughts.16 More research\nis needed to identify the effects of climate change on exposures to\nmycotoxins in geographic areas where exposures are endemic,8,17,18 including regions in Africa and\nAsia where concerning elevations in levels of aflatoxin exposure biomarkers\nhave been reported.3 While aflatoxins\nare recognized to be highly hepatocarcinogenic\nin humans, especially in those with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)\ninfection,1,3 other possible health effects from aflatoxins\nand other mycotoxins have been less well studied. Epidemiologic studies\nhave investigated the associations between dietary mycotoxin exposure\n(mostly aflatoxins) and child growth impairment, immune system effects,\nmorbidity, and mortality. However, the overall quality of the evidence\nis low, and the results are inconclusive.19 A variety of biological mechanisms have been proposed by which mycotoxins\nmay exert effects on human health,3,20,21 including on the gut microbiota.22 Mycotoxin exposure may also increase the risk for adverse\nfetal and maternal outcomes.23 Aflatoxins,\nfor example, can cross the placental barrier and exert effects in utero.(3) Carefully designed\nprospective cohort studies and cluster randomized controlled trials19,24 are needed to elucidate health risks attributable to exposure to\nmycotoxins and evaluate interventions which can reduce exposures.3 Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is an emerging\ntool for public\nhealth and environmental epidemiology, and has particular advantages\nin low-resource settings and in studies involving infants and children.25 DBSs are drops of whole blood from a minimally\ninvasive finger- or heel-prick, collected on specially designed filter\npaper (e.g., Whatman 903).26,27 We recently reviewed\nthe state of the science of using DBS sampling for measuring exposures\nto environmental tobacco smoke, trace elements (lead, mercury, cadmium,\nand arsenic), several important persistent organic pollutants (e.g.,\nper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances; PFAS), and endocrine disrupting\nchemicals.25 The number of developed and\nvalidated DBS assays for measuring environmental exposure biomarkers\ncontinues to grow,25,28,29 with many recent applications in larger-scale field studies conducted\nin low-resource settings.25 Volumetric\ntip microsampling (VTS) is another minimally invasive sampling technique\nwhere a fixed volume of blood (∼10.4 μL) is absorbed\non a tip, therefore potentially overcoming drawbacks of blood volume\nvariations (homogeneity issues) and hematocrit effects with DBS/DSS\npunching methods.30,31 DBS sampling and VTS are\nsuitable for estimating long-term and\nchronic exposures to mycotoxins because covalently bound mycotoxin\nexposure biomarkers, such as AFB1-lysine2 and Ochratoxin A (OTA),32,33 have long\nretention times in human blood (e.g., half-life: ∼35 days for\nOTA)9,32,34 due to their\nhigh binding to plasma proteins (e.g., human serum albumin).2,9,35,36 This can help to overcome limitations of using single spot measurements\nwith biomarkers with short biological half-lives (e.g., urinary metabolites)\nin cross sectional studies for determining the etiologies of multifactorial\nchronic diseases.37−39 For single spot measurements, intraclass correlation\ncoefficients (ICCs) can be reported to assist in interpreting the\nreliability of the exposure biomarker.38,40 ICCs are determined\nfrom repeated measurements from the same individual over various time\nperiods, compared to variations between individuals.40 Minimally invasive sampling methods can facilitate repeated\nmeasurements of mycotoxin exposure biomarkers in longitudinal cohort\nstudies, which can play a key role in establishing ICCs for various\nmycotoxin biomarkers in humans. This review summarizes assays\nusing minimally invasive sampling\ntechniques (DBS/DSS and VTS) for estimating exposures to mycotoxins\nin human blood and suggests the next steps, including lab and field-\nvalidation, required to incorporate minimally invasive sampling methods\ninto large-scale epidemiologic studies and global public health interventions."

(2016) validated previously developed\nmethods55,56 for measuring aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) lysine adducts in DBS samples using a high-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC)-fluorescence detection system (FDS). The method for detecting\nand quantifying AFB1-lysine adducts in DBS was further\nconfirmed and validated using LC-MS/MS.35 DBS methods were developed and validated in rats and then applied\nto quantify AFB1 lysine adduct levels in DBS samples (n = 36) from mothers and children in a previous longitudinal\nstudy in Kenya.35 Recovery rates of spiked\nrat DBS samples were close to 100% regardless of spotted blood volumes\n(20, 40, or 60 μL of blood).35 The\nLOD was determined to be 10 pg/mL of extract of 0.2 pg/mg of albumin,\nand the assay produced precise and reliable results. AFB1-lysine adducts showed a strong dose–response relationship\nwith administered doses of AFB1 in the animal model. Average AFB1-lysine adduct levels in the human DBS samples\nwas 11.88 pg/mg albumin.35 Human DBS and\nserum sample AFB1-lysine adduct levels had a Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of 0.784 (p < 0.0001).35 While detection rates were 100% in the high\nexposure group (n = 12, median adduct concentration\n= 136 pg/mg albumin), detection rates were around 50% in both the\nlow (n = 12, median adduct concentration = 4 pg/mg\nalbumin) and medium exposure groups (n = 12, median\nadduct concentration = 12 pg/mg albumin).35 Therefore, future work may seek to further lower the detection limits\nof this assay. Adducts in DBS samples were stable at 6 and 12 months\nwhen refrigerated at 4 °C in bags with desiccant.35 Osteresch et al. (2017) developed and\napplied an assay to measure\na total of 27 important mycotoxins and metabolites using HPLC-MS/MS,\nincluding the direct measurement of several aflatoxins (Aflatoxin\nB1; Aflatoxin B2; Aflatoxin G1; Aflatoxin\nG2; Aflatoxin M1).46 The scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) parameters for\nHPLC-MS/MS of all 27 mycotoxin analytes are reported.46 DBS and DSS samples were spiked with 100 μL of blood\nor serum from healthy volunteers from Germany, respectively. Using\nspiked DBS/DSS samples, recovery rates were high (>81%, with most\nclose to 100%) for all target aflatoxins in both DBS and DSS samples.46 Detection limits, including comparison to HPLC-MS/MS\nanalyses of whole blood (DBS) and plasma (DSS) assays, are reported\nin Table 3. This study also performed stability testing for all\n27 mycotoxins\nand metabolites across a variety of storage conditions (room temperature,\n4 °C [refrigerated], and −18 °C [frozen]) and at\nseveral time points (1, 5, and 10 weeks for room temperature; 24 weeks\nfor refrigerated and frozen conditions). The aflatoxins were stable\nat 1 week when stored at room temperature (recovery rates >84%,\nwith\nmost >93%).46 However, at 5- and 10\nweeks,\nrecovery rates for the aflatoxins decreased to as low as 44% and 17%\nwhen stored at room temperature, respectively.46 The time-dependent degradation was almost entirely mitigated\nat 24 weeks when samples were refrigerated (recovery rates >79%,\nwith\nmost >85%) or frozen (recovery rates >94%).46 Renaud et al.

(2015) measured OTA in human\nDBS samples using HPLC-MS/MS.34 This study\nalso measured the corresponding thermal degradation product, 2’R-ochratoxin\nA (2’R-OTA), which can form during the processing of contaminated\nfood, including during coffee roasting.34 In this study, venous blood was drawn from 34 coffee drinkers and\n16 noncoffee drinkers and 100 μL aliquots were applied to DBS\nsamples.34 OTA was detected in 100% of\nsamples from a concentration range of 0.071–0.383 ng/mL (mean:\n0.21 ng/mL).34 2’R-OTA was detected\nin 100% of samples in coffee drinkers with concentrations ranging\nfrom 0.021–0.414 ng/mL (mean: 0.11 ng/mL) and was detected\nin 0% of samples from noncoffee drinkers.34 These average concentrations were comparable to previous levels\nreported in the German adult population (∼0.2 ng/mL).34 This assay was developed for 40 samples per\nbatch and analytes were stable for up to 4 weeks when stored at 4\n°C.34 Osteresch et al. (2016)\nimproved upon this method by investigating the influence of hematocrit,\nblood spot volume, and DBS venous versus finger-prick blood samples.48 OTA and 2’R-OTA levels were analyzed\nin 8.8 mm punches (∼18.7 μL of blood) using HPLC-MS/MS\nand compared to values derived from whole DBS spots (∼100 μL\nof blood).48 Spiked DBS samples with known\nconcentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.00 ng/mL OTA and 2’R-OTA\nin whole spots were highly correlated (r2 > 0.99) with concentrations in the 8.8 mm punches.48 In addition, 8.8 mm punches were taken from\nthe center\nof DBS cards, which were spotted with venous blood volumes of 75,\n100, and 125 μL.48 The blood spot\nvolumes did not influence OTA measurements when the same DBS punch\nsizes were used, which suggests homogeneous dispersion. Matching venous\nand capillary DBS measurements were also compared using the same punch\nsizes, with excellent agreement between matching finger-prick (capillary)\nand venous DBS values (r2 = 0.93 and 0.91\nfor OTA and 2’R-OTA, respectively), suggesting capillary blood\nis suitable for DBS analyses.48 Overall,\nthe assay was sensitive and precise. The limit of detection\n(LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for both OTA and 2’R-OTA\nin matrix-free solution were 0.005 ng/mL and 0.013 ng/mL.48 The LOD and LOQ in the sampling matrix was only\ndetermined for 2’R-OTA and was 0.006 ng/mL and 0.021 ng/mL\nfor the 100 μL whole spot DBS samples, respectively.48 For punched DBS samples, the LOD and LOQ for\nOTA were reported to be 0.008 ng/mL and 0.026 ng/mL, respectively.48 Recovery rates were ∼100% for both OTA\nand 2’R-OTA.48 Hematocrit effects\nwere negligible.48 This assay was applied\nto a small German cohort (50 blood samples collected from volunteers\nduring the previous study)34 to evaluate\nthe accuracy of the DBS-punching method. OTA and 2’R-OTA levels\nwere determined from both 100 μL whole DBS spots and 8.8 mm\npunched discs.48 OTA had a detection frequency\nof 100% while 2’R-OTA was detected in 68% (34/50) of the samples.48 OTA concentrations derived from whole spots\n(100 μL blood) and 8.8 mm discs showed strong agreement (r2 = 0.68 and 0.70 for OTA and 2’R-OTA,\nrespectively).48 OTA and 2’R-OTA\nconcentrations in the sample ranged from ∼0.1 to 0.4 ng/mL.48 Given the low analyte concentrations investigated,\nthe results suggest that the punching method with smaller blood volumes\n(∼18.7 μL of blood) is adequate for OTA quantification.48 Osteresch et al. (2017) expanded the assay\nto include several ochratoxins\n(OTA, 2’R-OTA, Ochratoxin α (OTα), and 10-hydroxyochratoxin\nA (10-OH-OTA).46 Average recovery rates\nin spiked DBS/DSS samples were close to 100% for all target ochratoxins.46 The LOD and LOQ for OTA and 2’R-OTA was\nhigher than reported previously at 0.014 and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively.46 However, this assay produced LOQs, which are\ncomparable to LOQs (∼0.03 ng/mL) published in previous methods\nto detect and quantify OTA.46,60 For an additional comparison,\na recent assay developed using plasma (not DSS) had a LOD of 0.52\nng/mL and was able to detect OTA in 97.3% of samples.59Table 3 contains\nadditional comparisons between the DBS/DSS and other detection methods,\nincluding VTS. Both OTA and 2’R-OTA showed only minor matrix\neffects.46 Stability testing revealed\nthat OTA and 2’R-OTA were highly\nstable when stored at room temperature at 1 week (recovery rate: 99%),\n5 weeks (93%), and 10 weeks (89%).46 DBS\nsamples that were refrigerated or frozen also had high OTA and 2’R-OTA\nrecovery rates (>90%) at 24 weeks.46 In\ncontrast, OTα and 10-OH-OTA showed significant time-dependent\ndegradation when stored at room temperature, with recovery rates as\nlow as 35% for OTα at 10 weeks and 69% for 10-OH-OTA.46 Refrigerating the samples mitigated these effects\nwith recovery rates >81% for both analytes at 24 weeks, while freezing\nnearly eliminated any time-dependent degradation.46 This novel multimycotoxin assay was applied in two\nseparate studies\nreanalyzing previously collected samples.43,46 The first study46 applied the multimycotoxin\nassay to 50 DBS samples from a German cohort analyzed previously.34,48 Enniatin B (EnB), OTA, and 2’R-OTA were the only detectable\nmycotoxins and metabolites.46 This analysis\nlargely confirmed the positive findings of OTA and 2’R-OTA\nin DBS samples obtained from the same participants analyzed previously.\nHowever, since this method46 was found\nto have lower sensitivity and precision compared to the previously\ndeveloped methods specific for OTA and 2’R-OTA, some previously\nquantified samples fell between the assay’s LOD and LOQ.48 Comparing OTA and 2’R-OTA concentrations\nmeasured previously48 to the concentrations\nmeasured with the multimycotoxin assay on matching DBS samples showed\nhigh agreement,46 indicating both methods\nare reliable. The second study applied the multimycotoxin assay\nto 42 DSS samples\nfrom workers at a waste management plant in Portugal who were expected\nto have coexposure to multiple mycotoxins.43 DSS samples were created by spotting filter paper with 100 μL\nof serum. The entire spot was used for analyses using HPLC-MS/MS.\nA previous analysis of the same serum samples detected aflatoxins\nwith enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) methods,61 which had high agreement with approaches using\nHPLC-FDS for measuring aflatoxin albumin adducts.55 This study detected EnB, OTA, and 2’R-OTA at detection\nfrequencies of 100%, 100%, and 82%, respectively (with median concentrations\nof 0.0481, 0.756, and 0.323 ng/mL, respectively).43 These were the same mycotoxins detected in the previous\napplication study involving the German cohort.46 The authors speculated that coexposure to multiple mycotoxins\nlikely occurred via different routes of exposure (i.e., occupational\nexposures for aflatoxins and dietary exposure for the other mycotoxins).43 However, since a control group was not used\nfor this study, it was not possible to conclude that EnB, OTA, and\n2’R-OTA levels were from dietary exposures. Vidal et\nal. developed and validated a VTS-based method for multiple\nmycotoxins including OTA, AFB1, and FB1 using\nultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry\n(UPLC-MS/MS).30 VTSs were prepared by spiking\n5 different OTA concentration levels (0.5–12.5 ng/mL) on EDTA-anticoagulated\nblood samples obtained from a commercial vendor, Rode Kruis Vlaanderen\n(Ghent, Belgium). Recovery rates were 84–91% depending on spiked\nconcentrations (Table 2). Stabilities were >90% in both the 4 °C and room temperature\nconditions (Table 2). The VTS assay showed similar accuracy to DBS and liquid blood\nassays in terms of OTA analyses. Renaud et al. (2022) reported a coefficient\nof determination between DBS and VTS assays of 0.99.47 In addition, Vidal et al. (2022) showed OTA concentrations\nobtained by the VTS assay were similar to those obtained by whole\nblood from 20 blood samples. OTA showed good stability when using\nthe VTS assay. After 21 days, stability was close to 100% at room\ntemperature, while it was >90% in 4 °C.30 The LOD obtained by the VTS assay30 was\nseveral times higher than LODs obtained by DBS but lower than the\nLOD obtained by liquid plasma (Table 3)."

      "title": "Fumonisins",
      "text": "Fumonisins (FB) are mycotoxins which can\ngrow in maize and may increase the risk for neural tube defects (NTDs),\nstunting in children, and carcinogenesis.3,51 Exposure\nto fumonisins may be higher in regions where maize is a staple crop,\nsuch as Mexico, Central America,62 and\nSouth Africa.3,8 Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is likely the most prevalent and toxic to humans, with animal\nmodels demonstrating the kidneys and liver to be target organs of\neffects, including carcinogenicity.3,51 A few epidemiologic\nstudies have also found exposure to FB1 to be associated\nwith esophageal cancer risk.3,8 FB1 is classified\nas a group 2B possible human carcinogen by the IARC.58 High-quality data on exposure and health risks are lacking\nin humans due to difficulty in obtaining reliable and precise exposure\nassessments.3 Riley et al. hypothesized\nthat FB1 may exert human health effects (e.g., NTDs) via\nFB1 inhibition of ceramide synthase, which is an important\nenzyme involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids.41 Previous studies in animal models had demonstrated this\nto be a plausible mechanism to induce NTDs in humans.62−64 FB1 inhibition of ceramide synthase results in elevated\nlevels of sphinganine 1-phosphate (Sa 1-P) and, to a lesser extent,\nsphingosine 1-phosphate (So 1-P). Thus, Sa 1-P and the Sa 1-P:So 1-P\nratio could be used as biomarkers of effect (i.e., mechanism-based\nbiomarkers) for human exposure to FB1. Prior studies had\nvalidated the use of urinary FB1 (UFB1) as an\nexposure biomarker to fumonisins in the diet.65 Prior to these studies, blood-based biomarkers had not been used\nto measure exposure to fumonisins or to demonstrate evidence of ceramide\nsynthesis inhibition in humans.41 In a series of experiments, Riley et al. (2015a)\ndeveloped a DBS assay for estimating FB1 exposure by measuring\nSa 1-P and So 1-P in DBS samples using HPLC-MS/MS.41 The DBS assay was first developed and validated in a mouse\nmodel. In mice, oral administration of FB1, including at\nlevels sufficient to induce NTDs, was positively related to blood\nSa 1-P, So 1-P, and the Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratio (measured in DBS) in\na dose-dependent manner.41 Sa 1-P and the\nSa 1-P:So 1-P ratio also had a dose-dependent relationship with UFB1.41 In mice, Sa 1-P levels measured\nin DBS were positively related to Sa levels measured in target tissues,\nincluding the liver and kidneys.41 Elevated\nSa and the Sa:So ratio were also measured in embryonic tissue in mice\ngiven oral administration of FB1,41 thus supporting the mechanism by which FB1 might induce\nNTDs in vivo. After the methods were developed\nand validated in mice, the assay was applied to a small sample of\nhealthy human volunteers (n = 10) from the United\nStates. Volunteers ate maize-based food for three consecutive days\n(estimated FB1 intake: ∼2.94 μg/kg body weight\nper day). No significant changes (P < 0.05) of\nSa 1-P and So 1-P levels were detectable in DBS samples collected\nfrom these volunteers.41 Moreover, there\nwas no significant correlation between UFB1 and Sa 1-P:So\n1-P ratio across the three sampling time points (n = 25 total samples).41 Additional blood samples were obtained from\nvolunteers to conduct smaller laboratory-based experiments in which\nknown blood volumes were spotted onto DBS cards.41 From these experiments, it was determined that the LOQ\nfor Sa 1-P and So 1-P was 0.8 pmol using 8 mm DBS punches (∼15–17\nμL of blood).41 Sa 1-P and So 1-P\nlevels were detectable in spotted human blood volume extracts as low\nas 2.5 μL.41 A model was developed\nand validated for normalizing Sa 1-P and So 1-P in DBS samples by\nestimated blood volumes.41 Spotting different\nvolumes of blood onto DBS cards had no significant effects on Sa\n1-P:So 1-P ratio. Stability testing showed no significant time-dependent\ndegradation for the Sa 1-P and So 1-P biomarkers for 170 days when\nstored at −20 °C in spotted human DBS samples.41 This DBS assay was then applied in a pilot\nstudy (2010–2011)\nconducted in Guatemala to assess the feasibility of using DBS sampling\nin the field.41 In the pilot study, DBS\nsamples were collected from a total of 176 participants (n = 76 women and 100 men) from two departments (Chimaltenango and\nEscuintla) in Guatemala. Chimaltenango and Escuintla were originally\nselected to compare samples from the expected low and high FB exposure\npopulations, respectively. In other work, maize grown in hotter and\ndryer climates were determined to have higher FB contamination compared\nto maize grown at high elevations and colder climates.66 However, in this study, both Chimaltenango and\nEscuintla were ultimately determined to have low levels of FB exposure\nafter urine and maize sampling (estimated total FB intake: ∼0.41\nμg/kg of body weight per day). Subsequent analyses of DBS and\nurinary samples showed no relationship between UFB1, Sa\n1-P, So 1-P, or the Sa 1-p:So 1-P ratio in both men and women.41 The null findings of the pilot field study in\nGuatemala, as well as the small study involving volunteers from the\nUnited States, can likely be attributed to the low FB exposure levels\nof study participants. The study in the United States was also limited\nby a very small sample size (n = 10 volunteers).41 Therefore, detectable concentrations of Sa 1-P\nand So 1-P in DBS samples may only be seen among populations with\nchronically elevated FB exposures,41 especially\nif there is a threshold level above which FB inhibits ceramide synthase. In a follow-up larger field study (2011–2012), urinary and\nDBS samples were collected from a total of 1,240 women from two low-exposure\ndepartments (Chimaltenango, n = 439; Escuintla, n = 402) and one high-exposure department (Jutiapa, n = 399) in Guatemala.42 DBS\nsamples were collected from 1,233 of the study participants and used\nfor the analyses of Sa 1-P and So 1-P levels. Urine samples were collected\nat the same time points and later quantified for FB1 (UFB1). Urine and DBS samples were collected every 3 months over\na one year time frame (4 total sampling time points). Only women were\nrecruited for this study, because future work will investigate whether\nFB exposure increases the risk for NTDs. Maize in Jutiapa was determined\nto have total FB and FB1 contamination levels that were\napproximately 5–6 times higher than contamination levels in\nChimaltenango and Escuintla.66 UFB1 had a dose-dependent relationship with estimated dietary\nFB intake.66 The average UFB1 levels were in Jutiapa were 2.27 ng/mL compared to 0.38 and 0.26\nng/mL in Chimaltenango and Escuintla, respectively.66 Moreover, 75% of the study participants from the high-exposure\ndepartment (Jutiapa) were estimated to have total FB intake exceeding\n2 μg/kg body weight per day, which is considered the provisional\nmaximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI).66 These results confirm that FB exposure was higher in Jutiapa compared\nto Chimaltenango and Escuintla and that these were exposure levels\nof possible concern. Corroborating these findings, Sa 1-P concentrations,\nand Sa 1-P:So\n1-P ratios measured in DBS samples were found to be significantly\nhigher in Jutiapa compared to Chimaltenango or Escuintla.42 Individually matched DBS values of Sa 1-P and\nSa 1-P:So 1-P ratios were positively associated with UFB1 measurements,42 which provides further\nvalidation of the exposure biomarker. Moreover, these results were\ndemonstrated across sampling time points. The data reported also support\nthe hypothesis of a threshold effect by which Sa 1-P concentrations\n(>0.88 nmol/mL) and Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios (>0.36) are significantly\nassociated with elevated UFB1 concentrations above these\nthresholds.42 A confirmatory field\nstudy (February–March 2013) was conducted\nin one low exposure department (Sacatepéquez, n = 100) and two high exposure departments (Santa Rosa, n = 100, and Chiquimula, n = 99).42 A total of 299 study participants (all women) were included.\nMaize contamination levels were confirmed to be significantly higher\nin Santa Rosa and Chiquimula compared to Sacatepéquez. For\nexample, using maize sampling, the estimated average FB1 intake exceeded the PMTDI in 68% and 85% of study participants from\nSanta Rosa and Chiquimula, respectively.42 Similar FB exposure estimates were concluded from UFB1 measurements. Corroborating the prior field study, a dose-dependent\nrelationship between total FB intake and urinary FB1 was\ndemonstrated.42 Analyzing the DBS samples\n(n = 299) showed significantly higher concentrations\nof Sa 1-P and ratios of Sa 1-P:So 1-P in Chiquimula and Santa Rosa\ncompared to Sacatepéquez.42 As in\nthe prior study, individually matched Sa 1-P concentrations and Sa\n1-P and Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios were significantly correlated with UFB1 levels.42 Moreover, the results\nlargely confirmed the threshold effect reported in the previous (2011–2012)\nfield study.42 The results from these\nthree Guatemalan field studies (2010–2011\npilot study; 2011–2012; and 2012–2013) suggest that\nindividuals with UFB1 levels >0.1 ng/mL have an increased\nrisk for exceeding the PMTDI FB exposure level, while individuals\n>0.5 ng/mL will almost certainly exceed the PMTDI.42 Moreover, these studies support the hypothesis that FB1 inhibits the ceramide synthesis in humans. The next step\nwill be to investigate associations among UFB1, Sa 1-P,\nand Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios and incident NTD cases in a prospective cohort\nstudy. The studies by Riley et al.41,42,66 demonstrated that DBS sampling is feasible for large-scale\nfield studies measuring exposure to fumonisins (with simultaneous\ncollection of urine samples). It is important to note, however, that\nFB was not directly measured in the DBS samples in these studies. The multimycotoxin assay discussed previously46 included FB1, raising the possibility of directly\nmeasuring FB1 in DBS samples in future field studies rather\nthan measuring UFB1 in urine samples. The reported LOD\nand LOQ of the DBS assay for FB1 was 0.627 ng/mL and 2.5\nng/mL, respectively.46 The average recovery\nrate was 97% in spiked DBS samples and 61% in DSS samples.46 FB1 was stable in DBS samples when\nstored at −18 °C for 24 weeks. However, significant degradation\nwas apparent when stored at 20 °C for 5 (55% recovery rate) and\n10 weeks (37% recovery rate).46 Using these\nmethods, FB1 was not detectable in DBS samples from the\nsmall German cohort discussed previously (n = 50).46 The inability to detect FB in this sample would\nbe expected, since FB exposure was likely low in this population.\nSimilar findings were reported by Riley et al. in their initial studies\namong only low-exposure groups,41 and could\nreflect inadequate sensitivity of the assay. Applying this assay to\nDBS samples collected to samples from a population with likely higher\nlevels of exposure to FB, as was done in Riley et al. (2015b),42 should be an objective for future studies. Vidal et al. spiked samples in the VTS assay with 5 different FB1\nconcentrations (10–250 ng/mL).30 Compared with the multimycotoxin DBS assay,46 this VTS assay had lower sensitivity and stability. The LODs obtained\nby the VTS assay were several times higher than the LODs obtained\nby DBS or urine assays (Table 3). While higher concentrations of spiked FB1 (50–250\nng/mL) were relatively stable (i.e., >90%), recovery rates of FB1 at lower concentrations (10 ng/mL) were <70% at 21 weeks\nwhen refrigerated at 4 °C."

      "text": "Fumonisins (FB) are mycotoxins which can\ngrow in maize and may increase the risk for neural tube defects (NTDs),\nstunting in children, and carcinogenesis.3,51 Exposure\nto fumonisins may be higher in regions where maize is a staple crop,\nsuch as Mexico, Central America,62 and\nSouth Africa.3,8 Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is likely the most prevalent and toxic to humans, with animal\nmodels demonstrating the kidneys and liver to be target organs of\neffects, including carcinogenicity.3,51 A few epidemiologic\nstudies have also found exposure to FB1 to be associated\nwith esophageal cancer risk.3,8 FB1 is classified\nas a group 2B possible human carcinogen by the IARC.58 High-quality data on exposure and health risks are lacking\nin humans due to difficulty in obtaining reliable and precise exposure\nassessments.3 Riley et al. hypothesized\nthat FB1 may exert human health effects (e.g., NTDs) via\nFB1 inhibition of ceramide synthase, which is an important\nenzyme involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids.41 Previous studies in animal models had demonstrated this\nto be a plausible mechanism to induce NTDs in humans.62−64 FB1 inhibition of ceramide synthase results in elevated\nlevels of sphinganine 1-phosphate (Sa 1-P) and, to a lesser extent,\nsphingosine 1-phosphate (So 1-P). Thus, Sa 1-P and the Sa 1-P:So 1-P\nratio could be used as biomarkers of effect (i.e., mechanism-based\nbiomarkers) for human exposure to FB1. Prior studies had\nvalidated the use of urinary FB1 (UFB1) as an\nexposure biomarker to fumonisins in the diet.65 Prior to these studies, blood-based biomarkers had not been used\nto measure exposure to fumonisins or to demonstrate evidence of ceramide\nsynthesis inhibition in humans.41"

      "text": "In a series of experiments, Riley et al. (2015a)\ndeveloped a DBS assay for estimating FB1 exposure by measuring\nSa 1-P and So 1-P in DBS samples using HPLC-MS/MS.41 The DBS assay was first developed and validated in a mouse\nmodel. In mice, oral administration of FB1, including at\nlevels sufficient to induce NTDs, was positively related to blood\nSa 1-P, So 1-P, and the Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratio (measured in DBS) in\na dose-dependent manner.41 Sa 1-P and the\nSa 1-P:So 1-P ratio also had a dose-dependent relationship with UFB1.41 In mice, Sa 1-P levels measured\nin DBS were positively related to Sa levels measured in target tissues,\nincluding the liver and kidneys.41 Elevated\nSa and the Sa:So ratio were also measured in embryonic tissue in mice\ngiven oral administration of FB1,41 thus supporting the mechanism by which FB1 might induce\nNTDs in vivo. After the methods were developed\nand validated in mice, the assay was applied to a small sample of\nhealthy human volunteers (n = 10) from the United\nStates. Volunteers ate maize-based food for three consecutive days\n(estimated FB1 intake: ∼2.94 μg/kg body weight\nper day). No significant changes (P < 0.05) of\nSa 1-P and So 1-P levels were detectable in DBS samples collected\nfrom these volunteers.41 Moreover, there\nwas no significant correlation between UFB1 and Sa 1-P:So\n1-P ratio across the three sampling time points (n = 25 total samples).41 Additional blood samples were obtained from\nvolunteers to conduct smaller laboratory-based experiments in which\nknown blood volumes were spotted onto DBS cards.41 From these experiments, it was determined that the LOQ\nfor Sa 1-P and So 1-P was 0.8 pmol using 8 mm DBS punches (∼15–17\nμL of blood).41 Sa 1-P and So 1-P\nlevels were detectable in spotted human blood volume extracts as low\nas 2.5 μL.41 A model was developed\nand validated for normalizing Sa 1-P and So 1-P in DBS samples by\nestimated blood volumes.41 Spotting different\nvolumes of blood onto DBS cards had no significant effects on Sa\n1-P:So 1-P ratio. Stability testing showed no significant time-dependent\ndegradation for the Sa 1-P and So 1-P biomarkers for 170 days when\nstored at −20 °C in spotted human DBS samples.41 This DBS assay was then applied in a pilot\nstudy (2010–2011)\nconducted in Guatemala to assess the feasibility of using DBS sampling\nin the field.41 In the pilot study, DBS\nsamples were collected from a total of 176 participants (n = 76 women and 100 men) from two departments (Chimaltenango and\nEscuintla) in Guatemala. Chimaltenango and Escuintla were originally\nselected to compare samples from the expected low and high FB exposure\npopulations, respectively. In other work, maize grown in hotter and\ndryer climates were determined to have higher FB contamination compared\nto maize grown at high elevations and colder climates.66 However, in this study, both Chimaltenango and\nEscuintla were ultimately determined to have low levels of FB exposure\nafter urine and maize sampling (estimated total FB intake: ∼0.41\nμg/kg of body weight per day). Subsequent analyses of DBS and\nurinary samples showed no relationship between UFB1, Sa\n1-P, So 1-P, or the Sa 1-p:So 1-P ratio in both men and women.41 The null findings of the pilot field study in\nGuatemala, as well as the small study involving volunteers from the\nUnited States, can likely be attributed to the low FB exposure levels\nof study participants. The study in the United States was also limited\nby a very small sample size (n = 10 volunteers).41 Therefore, detectable concentrations of Sa 1-P\nand So 1-P in DBS samples may only be seen among populations with\nchronically elevated FB exposures,41 especially\nif there is a threshold level above which FB inhibits ceramide synthase. In a follow-up larger field study (2011–2012), urinary and\nDBS samples were collected from a total of 1,240 women from two low-exposure\ndepartments (Chimaltenango, n = 439; Escuintla, n = 402) and one high-exposure department (Jutiapa, n = 399) in Guatemala.42 DBS\nsamples were collected from 1,233 of the study participants and used\nfor the analyses of Sa 1-P and So 1-P levels. Urine samples were collected\nat the same time points and later quantified for FB1 (UFB1). Urine and DBS samples were collected every 3 months over\na one year time frame (4 total sampling time points). Only women were\nrecruited for this study, because future work will investigate whether\nFB exposure increases the risk for NTDs. Maize in Jutiapa was determined\nto have total FB and FB1 contamination levels that were\napproximately 5–6 times higher than contamination levels in\nChimaltenango and Escuintla.66 UFB1 had a dose-dependent relationship with estimated dietary\nFB intake.66 The average UFB1 levels were in Jutiapa were 2.27 ng/mL compared to 0.38 and 0.26\nng/mL in Chimaltenango and Escuintla, respectively.66 Moreover, 75% of the study participants from the high-exposure\ndepartment (Jutiapa) were estimated to have total FB intake exceeding\n2 μg/kg body weight per day, which is considered the provisional\nmaximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI).66 These results confirm that FB exposure was higher in Jutiapa compared\nto Chimaltenango and Escuintla and that these were exposure levels\nof possible concern. Corroborating these findings, Sa 1-P concentrations,\nand Sa 1-P:So\n1-P ratios measured in DBS samples were found to be significantly\nhigher in Jutiapa compared to Chimaltenango or Escuintla.42 Individually matched DBS values of Sa 1-P and\nSa 1-P:So 1-P ratios were positively associated with UFB1 measurements,42 which provides further\nvalidation of the exposure biomarker. Moreover, these results were\ndemonstrated across sampling time points. The data reported also support\nthe hypothesis of a threshold effect by which Sa 1-P concentrations\n(>0.88 nmol/mL) and Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios (>0.36) are significantly\nassociated with elevated UFB1 concentrations above these\nthresholds.42 A confirmatory field\nstudy (February–March 2013) was conducted\nin one low exposure department (Sacatepéquez, n = 100) and two high exposure departments (Santa Rosa, n = 100, and Chiquimula, n = 99).42 A total of 299 study participants (all women) were included.\nMaize contamination levels were confirmed to be significantly higher\nin Santa Rosa and Chiquimula compared to Sacatepéquez.

The studies by Riley et al.41,42,66 demonstrated that DBS sampling is feasible for large-scale\nfield studies measuring exposure to fumonisins (with simultaneous\ncollection of urine samples).

      "text": "This review summarizes recent advances in\nmeasuring mycotoxins\nin human DBS/DSS samples and VTS. The studies reviewed have focused\non method development with applications in relatively small populations,\nwhich have not yet been applied to larger-scale population-based studies.\nWhile Riley et al. demonstrated feasibility of performing DBS sampling\nfor measuring mycotoxin exposure biomarkers in larger-scale field\nstudies,42 studies which have applied the\nmultimycotoxin DBS/DSS assay by Osteresch et al. (2017) created DSS\nsamples from venous blood.43−45 The multimycotoxin assay adapted\nfor DBS/DSS46 represents a powerful method\nto detect an array of important mycotoxin exposure biomarkers and\ncan be useful for applications in large-scale temporal biomonitoring\nand surveillance studies. Although the assay’s sensitivity\nand precision were slightly lower for OTA, the assay performed well\noverall with recoveries greater than 90% for most target analytes.46 While other multimycotoxin assays have been\ndeveloped using human blood, plasma, and urine,67−69 this was the\nfirst assay adapted for DBS/DSS analyses and had high recovery rates.10 However, the assay was applied to a population\nwith undetectable exposures for most biomarkers (except for OTA, 2’R-OTA,\nand Enniatin B) and should be validated in populations with wider\nranges of mycotoxin exposures in future studies. In addition, this\nsample46 may be underpowered and larger\nsample sizes would likely result in higher detection frequencies for\nmany of the mycotoxin biomarkers analyzed. Multimycotoxin assays30,46 should be expanded\nto include additional mycotoxins of interest, including trichothecenes,\npatulin (PAT), and citrinin (CIT), which are important mycotoxins\nfound in many legislative efforts to reduce human exposures.7 In addition, mycotoxins such as tenuazonic acid\n(TeA), produced by the Alternaria species, have been\nmeasured in DBS samples using pig’s whole blood with low levels\nof detection.70 ZEA are also important\nmycotoxins included in the multimycotoxin assays developed by Osteresch\net al.46 and Vidal et al.30 which can result in adverse reproductive effects in animals,\nincluding infertility, embryo death, and testosterone attrition.71−73 In general, blood-based biomarkers have the potential to better\ncapture long-term mycotoxin exposure, while mycotoxin exposure biomarkers\nmeasured in the urine are more representative of acute exposures.10 This is especially true for blood protein adduct\nbiomarkers (e.g., hemoglobin or albumin adducts), which reflect an\nindividual’s exposure history integrated over weeks to months.12 Currently, urine is a preferred sampling matrix\nin field studies for many analytes due to its noninvasive nature and\nacceptability among study participants.7 However, DBS sampling represents a field-friendly complement to\nurine sample collection with a high level of acceptability by study\nparticipants,74−76 especially in settings where DBS sampling has been\nused for other purposes, such as for the monitoring of HIV antiretroviral\ntreatment.77 Moreover, the use of minimally\ninvasive sampling methods may facilitate repeated sampling from the\nsame individual in longitudinal cohort studies, which allows for determining\nICCs to inform reliability of mycotoxin exposure biomarkers.40 Since many mycotoxin exposure biomarkers\nare better detected in\nblood (e.g., OTA, 2’R-OTA, EnB46) and others are better detected in urine (e.g., deoxynivalenol-3-glucoronide46 and possibly fumonisins66), the field collection of both biological specimens is optimal when\nfeasible. Table 3 shows\nthat alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), alternariol (AOH), and FB1 have high detection capacity in urine (i.e., LOD < 0.1\nng/mL) while AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and\nBEA have high detection capacity in plasma (i.e., LOD < 0.1 ng/mL).\nA multimycotoxin assay has also recently been developed for dried\nurine spots.78 Furthermore, Schmidt et\nal. (2021) incorporated online solid-phase extraction with HPLC-MS/MS\nfor detecting mycotoxins biomarkers to achieve greater analytical\nsensitivity compared to other extraction methods (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).79 With further validation and adoption of DBS sampling for\nmeasuring chronic human exposure to mycotoxins, additional research\nquestions may be pursued, such as potential additive or synergistic\neffects between mycotoxin coexposures,8,43 other environmental\nexposures (e.g., trace elements, organic pollutants, and endocrine\ndisrupting chemicals),25 and associations\nwith systems biology (e.g., using omics).10,80 In addition, animal studies have suggested that aflatoxin and fumonisins\ncoexposures can synergistically increase the risk for developing hepatocellular\ncarcinoma.4 Because coexposure to these\ntoxins are common in many countries in Africa8 and Central America, multimycotoxin assays adapted to DBS would\nhave significant epidemiologic utility. Global awareness among\nkey stakeholders is growing for strengthening\nfood safety measures by detecting and reducing mycotoxin contamination\nlevels.4,81 Methods that quantify contamination levels\nin the food supply (i.e., upstream sources) should be coupled with\nhigh-throughput, ultrasensitive, and reliable public health tools\nthat quantify levels of human exposures (i.e., downstream effects\nof contamination in the food supply). DBS sampling can extend surveillance\nto rural subsistence farming communities, which are at greatest risk\nof exposure.8 Other advantages of using\nbiological sampling compared to food sampling alone include the heterogeneous\ndistribution of mycotoxins in foodstuffs, as well as the ability to\ncapture additional routes of exposure (e.g., inhalation and intradermal)\nand contamination that might arise from methods of food preparation.43 Recent innovations in detecting mycotoxin contaminants\nin food matrices include aptasensors, which present a low-cost, high-throughput,\nultrasensitive approach for improving surveillance across the food\nsupply chain.82 A novel, complementary\napproach uses dried extract spots (DES), which allows for sample collection\nof food matrices by minimally trained personnel and centralized laboratory\nprocessing for precise quantification of contaminants.83 Future work may also seek to evaluate the interchangeability\nof capillary and venous mycotoxin biomarkers to develop point of care\n(POC) devices, as was demonstrated in a small sample size (36 reproductive\nage women in Uganda) for albumin-normalized AFB1-lysine\nadducts.57 VTS presents another minimally\ninvasive sampling technique that\nmay have utility. In particular, concentrations of AFB1 or OTA collected\nfrom VTS had higher reproducibility84 than\nthose collected from DBS (Table 2).35,48 VTS also allows for easier laboratory\nblood extraction compared to standard DBS methods.47 The use of VTS facilitates sample identification during\nextraction, but this is not the case with DBS since it cannot be identified\nonce it has been punched.85,86 Vidal et al. (2021)\nvalidated a multimycotoxin VTS ultraperformance liquid chromatography-\ntandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) assay for 24 mycotoxins, including\naflatoxins, ZEA, ochratoxins, and fumonisins (Table 3).30 For multimycotoxins\nassays, VTS requires 0.25 mL of extraction solution for sonication,30 whereas DBS requires 2 mL46 (Section S1 of the Supporting Information). VTS values were found to be stable for at least 21 days with refrigeration\nor at room temperature.30 VTS-based procedures\nhad high recovery rates and stability (Table 2), while LODs of the VTS assay were approximately\none order higher than those of the DBS- or liquid plasma-based procedures\nfor ochratoxins, aflatoxins, and fumonisins (Table 3). These method validation results suggest\nthat VTS may serve as an alternative to DBS or conventional venous\nsampling to perform quantitative screening of the exposure of these\nmycotoxins for highly exposed populations. However, future work is\nneeded to improve the detection limits of the VTS assays. At\npresent, the most significant disadvantage of VTS is its relatively\nhigh cost compared to that of DBS sampling, therefore hindering its\nability to expand HBM and environmental epidemiologic studies at scale.\nVTM is currently offered as two commercially available devices: the\nMitra device by Neoteryx (which uses patented volumetric absorptive\nmicrosampling technology; VAMS) and the TASSO-M20 device by Tasso,\nInc.87 In addition, VTS is limited to commercially\navailable sample volumes (e.g., ∼10 μL), which may not\nbe sufficient for certain biomarkers such as aflatoxin adducts to\nhuman serum albumin.47 Many DBS assays\nfor environmental exposure biomarkers (e.g., cotinine) were found\nto have minimal hematocrit effects.25,88 Among mycotoxin\nDBS assays, hematocrit effects were negligible for analyses of OTA.48 Therefore, VTS may present the greatest value\nfor therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies where\nhematocrit effects are most significant.85,89 Future work validating DBS assays should continue to investigate\nhematocrit effects and elucidate the value of VTS versus DBS/DSS sampling\non a biomarker-by-biomarker basis. Overall, the development\nof field-friendly sampling methods87,90 will facilitate\nlongitudinal cohort studies investigating mycotoxins\nand associated health risks, for which there are currently very few\nstudies.13 Due to its low cost and convenience,\nDBS sampling is well-suited for extending temporal biomonitoring and\nsurveillance studies in low-resource settings, where mycotoxin exposures\nand associated health risks are the most prevalent.10 Scaling up minimally invasive sampling methods for the\nmonitoring of population-level exposures to mycotoxins can elucidate\nglobal health inequities91,92 and direct efforts\nfor reducing population exposure levels. In regions where exposure\nto mycotoxins is endemic, exposure is lifelong and may start in utero.(3) In high-resource countries,\nlow socioeconomic status may also present increased risk for exposure\nto mycotoxins; for example, among occupants of water-damaged buildings.93,94 Importantly, multimycotoxin assays adapted to DBS/DSS analyses represent\na unique and invaluable opportunity to advance studies elucidating\nthe human “exposome”,10,95 which represents\nthe totality of human exposures from conception onward. DBS/DSS\nmultimycotoxin assays can also be applied to epidemiologic\nstudies utilizing archived newborn dried blood spots25 and in studies involving infants and young children.35 Aflatoxins are lipophilic (i.e., polar) and\ncan exert effects in utero. For example, Turner et\nal. (2007) reported that aflatoxin-albumin adducts were detected from\nhalf of the cord blood samples collected from 138 Gambian infants\nwith levels ranging from 5.0–189.6 pg/mg.96 In Gambia, aflatoxin-albumin adducts were found in more\nthan 80% of tested infants between 3 and 9 years old, and blood levels\nof aflatoxin-albumin adducts were measured up to 720 pg/mg.97−99 An important limitation of minimally invasive sampling approaches\nis the analytical challenges associated with small sample volumes,\nwhich limit the ability to analyze samples for additional biomarkers.\nThis limitation may be overcome by continued innovations in microsampling\nmethods and continued improvements in analytical sensitivity and precision\nof mass spectrometry instrumentation87,90 as well as\nmultimycotoxin assays.30,46 Advancing the science of DBS/DSS\nsampling and VTS for measuring exposure to mycotoxins and implementing\nthese approaches widely as public health tools should be a research\npriority to promote global health equity. Additional work is needed\nto identify appropriate and sustainable financing mechanisms and implementation\nstrategies to incorporate DBS/DSS sampling and VTS into global health\nsurveillance systems for monitoring population-level exposures to\nmycotoxins in regions where exposures are endemic and in regions where\nexposures are expected to increase with global climate change.16,18,54"

Populations in many LMICs face higher chronic exposures to mycotoxins\ndue to climate and storage conditions that are conducive to fungal\ngrowth and mycotoxin production (e.g., high heat and humidity), exacerbated\nby poor or nonexistent food surveillance systems.3,15 Rural\nsubsistence farming communities face the greatest exposure risks because\nmany of these communities both produce and consume their own crops\nwithout regulatory oversight.3,8 In addition, climate\nchange is expected to increase human exposure to mycotoxins in many\ngeographic regions,7 including Europe and\nother regions that may experience more extreme weather events, such\nas heat waves and droughts.16 More research\nis needed to identify the effects of climate change on exposures to\nmycotoxins in geographic areas where exposures are endemic,8,17,18 including regions in Africa and\nAsia where concerning elevations in levels of aflatoxin exposure biomarkers\nhave been reported.3 While aflatoxins\nare recognized to be highly hepatocarcinogenic\nin humans, especially in those with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)\ninfection,1,3 other possible health effects from aflatoxins\nand other mycotoxins have been less well studied. Epidemiologic studies\nhave investigated the associations between dietary mycotoxin exposure\n(mostly aflatoxins) and child growth impairment, immune system effects,\nmorbidity, and mortality. However, the overall quality of the evidence\nis low, and the results are inconclusive.19 A variety of biological mechanisms have been proposed by which mycotoxins\nmay exert effects on human health,3,20,21 including on the gut microbiota.22 Mycotoxin exposure may also increase the risk for adverse\nfetal and maternal outcomes.23 Aflatoxins,\nfor example, can cross the placental barrier and exert effects in utero.(3) Carefully designed\nprospective cohort studies and cluster randomized controlled trials19,24 are needed to elucidate health risks attributable to exposure to\nmycotoxins and evaluate interventions which can reduce exposures.3 Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is an emerging\ntool for public\nhealth and environmental epidemiology, and has particular advantages\nin low-resource settings and in studies involving infants and children.25 DBSs are drops of whole blood from a minimally\ninvasive finger- or heel-prick, collected on specially designed filter\npaper (e.g., Whatman 903).26,27 We recently reviewed\nthe state of the science of using DBS sampling for measuring exposures\nto environmental tobacco smoke, trace elements (lead, mercury, cadmium,\nand arsenic), several important persistent organic pollutants (e.g.,\nper- and polyfluoroalkyl substances; PFAS), and endocrine disrupting\nchemicals.25 The number of developed and\nvalidated DBS assays for measuring environmental exposure biomarkers\ncontinues to grow,25,28,29 with many recent applications in larger-scale field studies conducted\nin low-resource settings.25 Volumetric\ntip microsampling (VTS) is another minimally invasive sampling technique\nwhere a fixed volume of blood (∼10.4 μL) is absorbed\non a tip, therefore potentially overcoming drawbacks of blood volume\nvariations (homogeneity issues) and hematocrit effects with DBS/DSS\npunching methods.30,31 DBS sampling and VTS are\nsuitable for estimating long-term and\nchronic exposures to mycotoxins because covalently bound mycotoxin\nexposure biomarkers, such as AFB1-lysine2 and Ochratoxin A (OTA),32,33 have long\nretention times in human blood (e.g., half-life: ∼35 days for\nOTA)9,32,34 due to their\nhigh binding to plasma proteins (e.g., human serum albumin).2,9,35,36 This can help to overcome limitations of using single spot measurements\nwith biomarkers with short biological half-lives (e.g., urinary metabolites)\nin cross sectional studies for determining the etiologies of multifactorial\nchronic diseases.37−39 For single spot measurements, intraclass correlation\ncoefficients (ICCs) can be reported to assist in interpreting the\nreliability of the exposure biomarker.38,40 ICCs are determined\nfrom repeated measurements from the same individual over various time\nperiods, compared to variations between individuals.40 Minimally invasive sampling methods can facilitate repeated\nmeasurements of mycotoxin exposure biomarkers in longitudinal cohort\nstudies, which can play a key role in establishing ICCs for various\nmycotoxin biomarkers in humans. This review summarizes assays\nusing minimally invasive sampling\ntechniques (DBS/DSS and VTS) for estimating exposures to mycotoxins\nin human blood and suggests the next steps, including lab and field-\nvalidation, required to incorporate minimally invasive sampling methods\ninto large-scale epidemiologic studies and global public health interventions.\n\n## Methods\nA systematic search of the literature (PubMed,\nEmbase, and CINAHL)\nwas conducted in March 2022.

Eight reports\nwere primarily methods development and validation (Table 1), while 3 reports were primarily\napplication of previously validated assays.43−45 Three reports\ndeveloped and/or validated DBS/DSS methods for detecting biomarkers\nof exposure to aflatoxins,35,46,47 three reports developed methods for ochratoxins,34,46,48 two reports developed methods for detecting\nfumonisins mechanism-based biomarkers,41,42 and one report\ndescribed methods for detecting fumonisins directly in DBS/DSS samples.46 Multimycotoxin asssays have been described for\nboth DBS/DSS46 and VTS.30 No studies utilized newborn DBS samples. DBS measurements\nwere compared to matched venous blood values in two studies.35,48 Among the studies which were primarily application of previously\ndeveloped assays, one study collected DSS samples from waste management\nworkers in Portugal,43 one study used DSS\nsamples in a relatively large (n = 1105) survey of\nschool children in Sweden,45 and one study\nused DSS samples to compare mycotoxin exposure among vegans and omnivores\nusing a cross sectional study design.44 No application studies collected DBS/DSS samples in the field, i.e.,\nall three studies spotted DSS samples from venous blood samples.43−45 Three larger-scale field studies collected DBS samples in Guatemala.41,42 One field study was conducted using previously collected DBS samples\nfrom a longitudinal cohort study in Kenya35 and one study used DBS samples collected in a German cohort.34,46,48 In total, three reports were\nfrom Germany,34,44,48 two reports were from Germany/Portugal,43,46 one report was from Belgium,30 one report\nwas from Sweden,45 three reports were from\nthe United States,35,41,42 and one report was from Canada.47 Additionally,\nthe extraction of mycotoxin biomarkers from DBS/DSS and VTS generally\nincludes two stages: (1) sonication of the sample with a water/acetonitrile\nmixture and (2) digestion with protonase. Specific key extraction\nprocedures conducted by each study are summarized in Section S2 of the Supporting Information.\n\n## Aflatoxins\nAflatoxins can contaminate groundnut- and\ncorn-based foods and is of particular concern in LMICs, including\nmany countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.2,49−52 Exposure to aflatoxins is a well-recognized risk factor for liver\ncancer and may also increase the risk for childhood stunting.3,49−51 AFB1 is classified as a Group 1A carcinogen\nby the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).53 A recent study reported an increase in the serum\nAFB1-lysine adduct levels from 2004 to 2014 from 2.35 to\n4.34 pg/mg albumin among two populations in Texas, United States.54 Therefore, more HBM studies are needed, especially\namong populations with expected increases in exposure to aflatoxins\nwith global climate change.16 Xue et al. (2016) validated previously developed\nmethods55,56 for measuring aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) lysine adducts in DBS samples using a high-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC)-fluorescence detection system (FDS). The method for detecting\nand quantifying AFB1-lysine adducts in DBS was further\nconfirmed and validated using LC-MS/MS.35 DBS methods were developed and validated in rats and then applied\nto quantify AFB1 lysine adduct levels in DBS samples (n = 36) from mothers and children in a previous longitudinal\nstudy in Kenya.35 Recovery rates of spiked\nrat DBS samples were close to 100% regardless of spotted blood volumes\n(20, 40, or 60 μL of blood).35 The\nLOD was determined to be 10 pg/mL of extract of 0.2 pg/mg of albumin,\nand the assay produced precise and reliable results. AFB1-lysine adducts showed a strong dose–response relationship\nwith administered doses of AFB1 in the animal model. Average AFB1-lysine adduct levels in the human DBS samples\nwas 11.88 pg/mg albumin.35 Human DBS and\nserum sample AFB1-lysine adduct levels had a Pearson correlation\ncoefficient of 0.784 (p < 0.0001).35 While detection rates were 100% in the high\nexposure group (n = 12, median adduct concentration\n= 136 pg/mg albumin), detection rates were around 50% in both the\nlow (n = 12, median adduct concentration = 4 pg/mg\nalbumin) and medium exposure groups (n = 12, median\nadduct concentration = 12 pg/mg albumin).35 Therefore, future work may seek to further lower the detection limits\nof this assay. Adducts in DBS samples were stable at 6 and 12 months\nwhen refrigerated at 4 °C in bags with desiccant.35 Osteresch et al. (2017) developed and\napplied an assay to measure\na total of 27 important mycotoxins and metabolites using HPLC-MS/MS,\nincluding the direct measurement of several aflatoxins (Aflatoxin\nB1; Aflatoxin B2; Aflatoxin G1; Aflatoxin\nG2; Aflatoxin M1).46 The scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) parameters for\nHPLC-MS/MS of all 27 mycotoxin analytes are reported.46 DBS and DSS samples were spiked with 100 μL of blood\nor serum from healthy volunteers from Germany, respectively. Using\nspiked DBS/DSS samples, recovery rates were high (>81%, with most\nclose to 100%) for all target aflatoxins in both DBS and DSS samples.46 Detection limits, including comparison to HPLC-MS/MS\nanalyses of whole blood (DBS) and plasma (DSS) assays, are reported\nin Table 3. This study also performed stability testing for all\n27 mycotoxins\nand metabolites across a variety of storage conditions (room temperature,\n4 °C [refrigerated], and −18 °C [frozen]) and at\nseveral time points (1, 5, and 10 weeks for room temperature; 24 weeks\nfor refrigerated and frozen conditions). The aflatoxins were stable\nat 1 week when stored at room temperature (recovery rates >84%,\nwith\nmost >93%).46 However, at 5- and 10\nweeks,\nrecovery rates for the aflatoxins decreased to as low as 44% and 17%\nwhen stored at room temperature, respectively.46 The time-dependent degradation was almost entirely mitigated\nat 24 weeks when samples were refrigerated (recovery rates >79%,\nwith\nmost >85%) or frozen (recovery rates >94%).46 Renaud et al. (2022) produced reference materials\nof AFB1-lysine HSA adducts by spotting known blood volumes\n(20 μL)\nonto DBS cards at varying concentrations.47 In this study, DBS reference materials were compared to VTS and\nserum samples. VTS had a high agreement with known serum sample values,\nwhile DBS was found to have significant matrix effects (signal suppression).\nThis may have resulted from not using an initial extraction step resulting\nin protein digestion directly on the DBS cards.47 Additionally, VTS with known concentrations ranging from\n4 to 50 ng/mL AFB1-lysine were highly correlated (r2 = 0.99) with DBS concentrations (Table 2).47 Srinivasan et al. (2022) explored the concordance of AFB1-lysine adducts in matching venous and capillary blood samples\n(not DBS) among 36 study participants.57 In this study, the albumin-normalized AFB1-lysine adduct\nconcentrations between venous and capillary samples were found to\nhave reasonable agreement (r = 0.71).57\n\n## Background\nAflatoxins can contaminate groundnut- and\ncorn-based foods and is of particular concern in LMICs, including\nmany countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.2,49−52 Exposure to aflatoxins is a well-recognized risk factor for liver\ncancer and may also increase the risk for childhood stunting.3,49−51 AFB1 is classified as a Group 1A carcinogen\nby the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).53 A recent study reported an increase in the serum\nAFB1-lysine adduct levels from 2004 to 2014 from 2.35 to\n4.34 pg/mg albumin among two populations in Texas, United States.54 Therefore, more HBM studies are needed, especially\namong populations with expected increases in exposure to aflatoxins\nwith global climate change.16\n\n## Methods\nXue et al.

OTA exposure levels were\nhigher than previous studies which quantified OTA levels in blood\nor plasma in other regions of Spain (range of means: 0.63–1.19\nng/mL).59 Other countries for which OTA\nlevels have been recently reported include Sweden, China, the Czech\nRepublic, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Bangladesh, and Egypt (ranges\nof mean concentrations: undetectable to 1.21 ng/mL).59 Cramer et al. (2015) measured OTA in human\nDBS samples using HPLC-MS/MS.34 This study\nalso measured the corresponding thermal degradation product, 2’R-ochratoxin\nA (2’R-OTA), which can form during the processing of contaminated\nfood, including during coffee roasting.34 In this study, venous blood was drawn from 34 coffee drinkers and\n16 noncoffee drinkers and 100 μL aliquots were applied to DBS\nsamples.34 OTA was detected in 100% of\nsamples from a concentration range of 0.071–0.383 ng/mL (mean:\n0.21 ng/mL).34 2’R-OTA was detected\nin 100% of samples in coffee drinkers with concentrations ranging\nfrom 0.021–0.414 ng/mL (mean: 0.11 ng/mL) and was detected\nin 0% of samples from noncoffee drinkers.34 These average concentrations were comparable to previous levels\nreported in the German adult population (∼0.2 ng/mL).34 This assay was developed for 40 samples per\nbatch and analytes were stable for up to 4 weeks when stored at 4\n°C.34 Osteresch et al. (2016)\nimproved upon this method by investigating the influence of hematocrit,\nblood spot volume, and DBS venous versus finger-prick blood samples.48 OTA and 2’R-OTA levels were analyzed\nin 8.8 mm punches (∼18.7 μL of blood) using HPLC-MS/MS\nand compared to values derived from whole DBS spots (∼100 μL\nof blood).48 Spiked DBS samples with known\nconcentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.00 ng/mL OTA and 2’R-OTA\nin whole spots were highly correlated (r2 > 0.99) with concentrations in the 8.8 mm punches.48 In addition, 8.8 mm punches were taken from\nthe center\nof DBS cards, which were spotted with venous blood volumes of 75,\n100, and 125 μL.48 The blood spot\nvolumes did not influence OTA measurements when the same DBS punch\nsizes were used, which suggests homogeneous dispersion. Matching venous\nand capillary DBS measurements were also compared using the same punch\nsizes, with excellent agreement between matching finger-prick (capillary)\nand venous DBS values (r2 = 0.93 and 0.91\nfor OTA and 2’R-OTA, respectively), suggesting capillary blood\nis suitable for DBS analyses.48 Overall,\nthe assay was sensitive and precise. The limit of detection\n(LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for both OTA and 2’R-OTA\nin matrix-free solution were 0.005 ng/mL and 0.013 ng/mL.48 The LOD and LOQ in the sampling matrix was only\ndetermined for 2’R-OTA and was 0.006 ng/mL and 0.021 ng/mL\nfor the 100 μL whole spot DBS samples, respectively.48 For punched DBS samples, the LOD and LOQ for\nOTA were reported to be 0.008 ng/mL and 0.026 ng/mL, respectively.48 Recovery rates were ∼100% for both OTA\nand 2’R-OTA.48 Hematocrit effects\nwere negligible.48 This assay was applied\nto a small German cohort (50 blood samples collected from volunteers\nduring the previous study)34 to evaluate\nthe accuracy of the DBS-punching method. OTA and 2’R-OTA levels\nwere determined from both 100 μL whole DBS spots and 8.8 mm\npunched discs.48 OTA had a detection frequency\nof 100% while 2’R-OTA was detected in 68% (34/50) of the samples.48 OTA concentrations derived from whole spots\n(100 μL blood) and 8.8 mm discs showed strong agreement (r2 = 0.68 and 0.70 for OTA and 2’R-OTA,\nrespectively).48 OTA and 2’R-OTA\nconcentrations in the sample ranged from ∼0.1 to 0.4 ng/mL.48 Given the low analyte concentrations investigated,\nthe results suggest that the punching method with smaller blood volumes\n(∼18.7 μL of blood) is adequate for OTA quantification.48 Osteresch et al. (2017) expanded the assay\nto include several ochratoxins\n(OTA, 2’R-OTA, Ochratoxin α (OTα), and 10-hydroxyochratoxin\nA (10-OH-OTA).46 Average recovery rates\nin spiked DBS/DSS samples were close to 100% for all target ochratoxins.46 The LOD and LOQ for OTA and 2’R-OTA was\nhigher than reported previously at 0.014 and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively.46 However, this assay produced LOQs, which are\ncomparable to LOQs (∼0.03 ng/mL) published in previous methods\nto detect and quantify OTA.46,60 For an additional comparison,\na recent assay developed using plasma (not DSS) had a LOD of 0.52\nng/mL and was able to detect OTA in 97.3% of samples.59Table 3 contains\nadditional comparisons between the DBS/DSS and other detection methods,\nincluding VTS. Both OTA and 2’R-OTA showed only minor matrix\neffects.46 Stability testing revealed\nthat OTA and 2’R-OTA were highly\nstable when stored at room temperature at 1 week (recovery rate: 99%),\n5 weeks (93%), and 10 weeks (89%).46 DBS\nsamples that were refrigerated or frozen also had high OTA and 2’R-OTA\nrecovery rates (>90%) at 24 weeks.46 In\ncontrast, OTα and 10-OH-OTA showed significant time-dependent\ndegradation when stored at room temperature, with recovery rates as\nlow as 35% for OTα at 10 weeks and 69% for 10-OH-OTA.46 Refrigerating the samples mitigated these effects\nwith recovery rates >81% for both analytes at 24 weeks, while freezing\nnearly eliminated any time-dependent degradation.46 This novel multimycotoxin assay was applied in two\nseparate studies\nreanalyzing previously collected samples.43,46 The first study46 applied the multimycotoxin\nassay to 50 DBS samples from a German cohort analyzed previously.34,48 Enniatin B (EnB), OTA, and 2’R-OTA were the only detectable\nmycotoxins and metabolites.46 This analysis\nlargely confirmed the positive findings of OTA and 2’R-OTA\nin DBS samples obtained from the same participants analyzed previously.\nHowever, since this method46 was found\nto have lower sensitivity and precision compared to the previously\ndeveloped methods specific for OTA and 2’R-OTA, some previously\nquantified samples fell between the assay’s LOD and LOQ.48 Comparing OTA and 2’R-OTA concentrations\nmeasured previously48 to the concentrations\nmeasured with the multimycotoxin assay on matching DBS samples showed\nhigh agreement,46 indicating both methods\nare reliable. The second study applied the multimycotoxin assay\nto 42 DSS samples\nfrom workers at a waste management plant in Portugal who were expected\nto have coexposure to multiple mycotoxins.43 DSS samples were created by spotting filter paper with 100 μL\nof serum. The entire spot was used for analyses using HPLC-MS/MS.\nA previous analysis of the same serum samples detected aflatoxins\nwith enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) methods,61 which had high agreement with approaches using\nHPLC-FDS for measuring aflatoxin albumin adducts.55 This study detected EnB, OTA, and 2’R-OTA at detection\nfrequencies of 100%, 100%, and 82%, respectively (with median concentrations\nof 0.0481, 0.756, and 0.323 ng/mL, respectively).43 These were the same mycotoxins detected in the previous\napplication study involving the German cohort.46 The authors speculated that coexposure to multiple mycotoxins\nlikely occurred via different routes of exposure (i.e., occupational\nexposures for aflatoxins and dietary exposure for the other mycotoxins).43 However, since a control group was not used\nfor this study, it was not possible to conclude that EnB, OTA, and\n2’R-OTA levels were from dietary exposures. Vidal et\nal. developed and validated a VTS-based method for multiple\nmycotoxins including OTA, AFB1, and FB1 using\nultraperformance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry\n(UPLC-MS/MS).30 VTSs were prepared by spiking\n5 different OTA concentration levels (0.5–12.5 ng/mL) on EDTA-anticoagulated\nblood samples obtained from a commercial vendor, Rode Kruis Vlaanderen\n(Ghent, Belgium). Recovery rates were 84–91% depending on spiked\nconcentrations (Table 2). Stabilities were >90% in both the 4 °C and room temperature\nconditions (Table 2). The VTS assay showed similar accuracy to DBS and liquid blood\nassays in terms of OTA analyses. Renaud et al. (2022) reported a coefficient\nof determination between DBS and VTS assays of 0.99.47 In addition, Vidal et al. (2022) showed OTA concentrations\nobtained by the VTS assay were similar to those obtained by whole\nblood from 20 blood samples. OTA showed good stability when using\nthe VTS assay. After 21 days, stability was close to 100% at room\ntemperature, while it was >90% in 4 °C.30 The LOD obtained by the VTS assay30 was\nseveral times higher than LODs obtained by DBS but lower than the\nLOD obtained by liquid plasma (Table 3).\n\n## Background\nOTA is the most toxic of the ochratoxins\nand can be found in coffee beans, cereals (oats, maize, wheat, and\nbarley), and other food sources.20,51 In animal\nmodels, OTA has been demonstrated to be nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic,\ngenotoxic, and teratogenic.20,51 OTA is classified as\na group 2B substance of possible human carcinogenicity by the IARC.58 Blood OTA levels are primarily bound to human\nserum albumin.20 A recent HBM study\nconducted in Spain quantified the plasma levels of 19 mycotoxin biomarkers\namong 438 individuals and reported OTA to be the most prevalent exposure\nbiomarker.59 The LOD of this assay, which\nused plasma as a sampling matrix, was 0.52 ng/mL and OTA levels were\ndetected in 97.3% of samples (concentration range: undetectable to\n45.7 ng/mL, mean: 2.99 ng/mL).59 Ochratoxin\nB was also detectable in 10% of the samples. OTA exposure levels were\nhigher than previous studies which quantified OTA levels in blood\nor plasma in other regions of Spain (range of means: 0.63–1.19\nng/mL).59 Other countries for which OTA\nlevels have been recently reported include Sweden, China, the Czech\nRepublic, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Bangladesh, and Egypt (ranges\nof mean concentrations: undetectable to 1.21 ng/mL).59\n\n## Methods\nCramer et al. (2015) measured OTA in human\nDBS samples using HPLC-MS/MS.34 This study\nalso measured the corresponding thermal degradation product, 2’R-ochratoxin\nA (2’R-OTA), which can form during the processing of contaminated\nfood, including during coffee roasting.34 In this study, venous blood was drawn from 34 coffee drinkers and\n16 noncoffee drinkers and 100 μL aliquots were applied to DBS\nsamples.34 OTA was detected in 100% of\nsamples from a concentration range of 0.071–0.383 ng/mL (mean:\n0.21 ng/mL).34 2’R-OTA was detected\nin 100% of samples in coffee drinkers with concentrations ranging\nfrom 0.021–0.414 ng/mL (mean: 0.11 ng/mL) and was detected\nin 0% of samples from noncoffee drinkers.34 These average concentrations were comparable to previous levels\nreported in the German adult population (∼0.2 ng/mL).34 This assay was developed for 40 samples per\nbatch and analytes were stable for up to 4 weeks when stored at 4\n°C.34 Osteresch et al. (2016)\nimproved upon this method by investigating the influence of hematocrit,\nblood spot volume, and DBS venous versus finger-prick blood samples.48 OTA and 2’R-OTA levels were analyzed\nin 8.8 mm punches (∼18.7 μL of blood) using HPLC-MS/MS\nand compared to values derived from whole DBS spots (∼100 μL\nof blood).48 Spiked DBS samples with known\nconcentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.00 ng/mL OTA and 2’R-OTA\nin whole spots were highly correlated (r2 > 0.99) with concentrations in the 8.8 mm punches.48 In addition, 8.8 mm punches were taken from\nthe center\nof DBS cards, which were spotted with venous blood volumes of 75,\n100, and 125 μL.48 The blood spot\nvolumes did not influence OTA measurements when the same DBS punch\nsizes were used, which suggests homogeneous dispersion. Matching venous\nand capillary DBS measurements were also compared using the same punch\nsizes, with excellent agreement between matching finger-prick (capillary)\nand venous DBS values (r2 = 0.93 and 0.91\nfor OTA and 2’R-OTA, respectively), suggesting capillary blood\nis suitable for DBS analyses.48 Overall,\nthe assay was sensitive and precise.

Thus, Sa 1-P and the Sa 1-P:So 1-P\nratio could be used as biomarkers of effect (i.e., mechanism-based\nbiomarkers) for human exposure to FB1. Prior studies had\nvalidated the use of urinary FB1 (UFB1) as an\nexposure biomarker to fumonisins in the diet.65 Prior to these studies, blood-based biomarkers had not been used\nto measure exposure to fumonisins or to demonstrate evidence of ceramide\nsynthesis inhibition in humans.41 In a series of experiments, Riley et al. (2015a)\ndeveloped a DBS assay for estimating FB1 exposure by measuring\nSa 1-P and So 1-P in DBS samples using HPLC-MS/MS.41 The DBS assay was first developed and validated in a mouse\nmodel. In mice, oral administration of FB1, including at\nlevels sufficient to induce NTDs, was positively related to blood\nSa 1-P, So 1-P, and the Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratio (measured in DBS) in\na dose-dependent manner.41 Sa 1-P and the\nSa 1-P:So 1-P ratio also had a dose-dependent relationship with UFB1.41 In mice, Sa 1-P levels measured\nin DBS were positively related to Sa levels measured in target tissues,\nincluding the liver and kidneys.41 Elevated\nSa and the Sa:So ratio were also measured in embryonic tissue in mice\ngiven oral administration of FB1,41 thus supporting the mechanism by which FB1 might induce\nNTDs in vivo. After the methods were developed\nand validated in mice, the assay was applied to a small sample of\nhealthy human volunteers (n = 10) from the United\nStates. Volunteers ate maize-based food for three consecutive days\n(estimated FB1 intake: ∼2.94 μg/kg body weight\nper day). No significant changes (P < 0.05) of\nSa 1-P and So 1-P levels were detectable in DBS samples collected\nfrom these volunteers.41 Moreover, there\nwas no significant correlation between UFB1 and Sa 1-P:So\n1-P ratio across the three sampling time points (n = 25 total samples).41 Additional blood samples were obtained from\nvolunteers to conduct smaller laboratory-based experiments in which\nknown blood volumes were spotted onto DBS cards.41 From these experiments, it was determined that the LOQ\nfor Sa 1-P and So 1-P was 0.8 pmol using 8 mm DBS punches (∼15–17\nμL of blood).41 Sa 1-P and So 1-P\nlevels were detectable in spotted human blood volume extracts as low\nas 2.5 μL.41 A model was developed\nand validated for normalizing Sa 1-P and So 1-P in DBS samples by\nestimated blood volumes.41 Spotting different\nvolumes of blood onto DBS cards had no significant effects on Sa\n1-P:So 1-P ratio. Stability testing showed no significant time-dependent\ndegradation for the Sa 1-P and So 1-P biomarkers for 170 days when\nstored at −20 °C in spotted human DBS samples.41 This DBS assay was then applied in a pilot\nstudy (2010–2011)\nconducted in Guatemala to assess the feasibility of using DBS sampling\nin the field.41 In the pilot study, DBS\nsamples were collected from a total of 176 participants (n = 76 women and 100 men) from two departments (Chimaltenango and\nEscuintla) in Guatemala. Chimaltenango and Escuintla were originally\nselected to compare samples from the expected low and high FB exposure\npopulations, respectively. In other work, maize grown in hotter and\ndryer climates were determined to have higher FB contamination compared\nto maize grown at high elevations and colder climates.66 However, in this study, both Chimaltenango and\nEscuintla were ultimately determined to have low levels of FB exposure\nafter urine and maize sampling (estimated total FB intake: ∼0.41\nμg/kg of body weight per day). Subsequent analyses of DBS and\nurinary samples showed no relationship between UFB1, Sa\n1-P, So 1-P, or the Sa 1-p:So 1-P ratio in both men and women.41 The null findings of the pilot field study in\nGuatemala, as well as the small study involving volunteers from the\nUnited States, can likely be attributed to the low FB exposure levels\nof study participants. The study in the United States was also limited\nby a very small sample size (n = 10 volunteers).41 Therefore, detectable concentrations of Sa 1-P\nand So 1-P in DBS samples may only be seen among populations with\nchronically elevated FB exposures,41 especially\nif there is a threshold level above which FB inhibits ceramide synthase. In a follow-up larger field study (2011–2012), urinary and\nDBS samples were collected from a total of 1,240 women from two low-exposure\ndepartments (Chimaltenango, n = 439; Escuintla, n = 402) and one high-exposure department (Jutiapa, n = 399) in Guatemala.42 DBS\nsamples were collected from 1,233 of the study participants and used\nfor the analyses of Sa 1-P and So 1-P levels. Urine samples were collected\nat the same time points and later quantified for FB1 (UFB1). Urine and DBS samples were collected every 3 months over\na one year time frame (4 total sampling time points). Only women were\nrecruited for this study, because future work will investigate whether\nFB exposure increases the risk for NTDs. Maize in Jutiapa was determined\nto have total FB and FB1 contamination levels that were\napproximately 5–6 times higher than contamination levels in\nChimaltenango and Escuintla.66 UFB1 had a dose-dependent relationship with estimated dietary\nFB intake.66 The average UFB1 levels were in Jutiapa were 2.27 ng/mL compared to 0.38 and 0.26\nng/mL in Chimaltenango and Escuintla, respectively.66 Moreover, 75% of the study participants from the high-exposure\ndepartment (Jutiapa) were estimated to have total FB intake exceeding\n2 μg/kg body weight per day, which is considered the provisional\nmaximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI).66 These results confirm that FB exposure was higher in Jutiapa compared\nto Chimaltenango and Escuintla and that these were exposure levels\nof possible concern. Corroborating these findings, Sa 1-P concentrations,\nand Sa 1-P:So\n1-P ratios measured in DBS samples were found to be significantly\nhigher in Jutiapa compared to Chimaltenango or Escuintla.42 Individually matched DBS values of Sa 1-P and\nSa 1-P:So 1-P ratios were positively associated with UFB1 measurements,42 which provides further\nvalidation of the exposure biomarker. Moreover, these results were\ndemonstrated across sampling time points. The data reported also support\nthe hypothesis of a threshold effect by which Sa 1-P concentrations\n(>0.88 nmol/mL) and Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios (>0.36) are significantly\nassociated with elevated UFB1 concentrations above these\nthresholds.42 A confirmatory field\nstudy (February–March 2013) was conducted\nin one low exposure department (Sacatepéquez, n = 100) and two high exposure departments (Santa Rosa, n = 100, and Chiquimula, n = 99).42 A total of 299 study participants (all women) were included.\nMaize contamination levels were confirmed to be significantly higher\nin Santa Rosa and Chiquimula compared to Sacatepéquez. For\nexample, using maize sampling, the estimated average FB1 intake exceeded the PMTDI in 68% and 85% of study participants from\nSanta Rosa and Chiquimula, respectively.42 Similar FB exposure estimates were concluded from UFB1 measurements. Corroborating the prior field study, a dose-dependent\nrelationship between total FB intake and urinary FB1 was\ndemonstrated.42 Analyzing the DBS samples\n(n = 299) showed significantly higher concentrations\nof Sa 1-P and ratios of Sa 1-P:So 1-P in Chiquimula and Santa Rosa\ncompared to Sacatepéquez.42 As in\nthe prior study, individually matched Sa 1-P concentrations and Sa\n1-P and Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios were significantly correlated with UFB1 levels.42 Moreover, the results\nlargely confirmed the threshold effect reported in the previous (2011–2012)\nfield study.42 The results from these\nthree Guatemalan field studies (2010–2011\npilot study; 2011–2012; and 2012–2013) suggest that\nindividuals with UFB1 levels >0.1 ng/mL have an increased\nrisk for exceeding the PMTDI FB exposure level, while individuals\n>0.5 ng/mL will almost certainly exceed the PMTDI.42 Moreover, these studies support the hypothesis that FB1 inhibits the ceramide synthesis in humans. The next step\nwill be to investigate associations among UFB1, Sa 1-P,\nand Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios and incident NTD cases in a prospective cohort\nstudy. The studies by Riley et al.41,42,66 demonstrated that DBS sampling is feasible for large-scale\nfield studies measuring exposure to fumonisins (with simultaneous\ncollection of urine samples). It is important to note, however, that\nFB was not directly measured in the DBS samples in these studies. The multimycotoxin assay discussed previously46 included FB1, raising the possibility of directly\nmeasuring FB1 in DBS samples in future field studies rather\nthan measuring UFB1 in urine samples. The reported LOD\nand LOQ of the DBS assay for FB1 was 0.627 ng/mL and 2.5\nng/mL, respectively.46 The average recovery\nrate was 97% in spiked DBS samples and 61% in DSS samples.46 FB1 was stable in DBS samples when\nstored at −18 °C for 24 weeks. However, significant degradation\nwas apparent when stored at 20 °C for 5 (55% recovery rate) and\n10 weeks (37% recovery rate).46 Using these\nmethods, FB1 was not detectable in DBS samples from the\nsmall German cohort discussed previously (n = 50).46 The inability to detect FB in this sample would\nbe expected, since FB exposure was likely low in this population.\nSimilar findings were reported by Riley et al. in their initial studies\namong only low-exposure groups,41 and could\nreflect inadequate sensitivity of the assay. Applying this assay to\nDBS samples collected to samples from a population with likely higher\nlevels of exposure to FB, as was done in Riley et al. (2015b),42 should be an objective for future studies. Vidal et al. spiked samples in the VTS assay with 5 different FB1\nconcentrations (10–250 ng/mL).30 Compared with the multimycotoxin DBS assay,46 this VTS assay had lower sensitivity and stability. The LODs obtained\nby the VTS assay were several times higher than the LODs obtained\nby DBS or urine assays (Table 3). While higher concentrations of spiked FB1 (50–250\nng/mL) were relatively stable (i.e., >90%), recovery rates of FB1 at lower concentrations (10 ng/mL) were <70% at 21 weeks\nwhen refrigerated at 4 °C.\n\n## Background\nFumonisins (FB) are mycotoxins which can\ngrow in maize and may increase the risk for neural tube defects (NTDs),\nstunting in children, and carcinogenesis.3,51 Exposure\nto fumonisins may be higher in regions where maize is a staple crop,\nsuch as Mexico, Central America,62 and\nSouth Africa.3,8 Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is likely the most prevalent and toxic to humans, with animal\nmodels demonstrating the kidneys and liver to be target organs of\neffects, including carcinogenicity.3,51 A few epidemiologic\nstudies have also found exposure to FB1 to be associated\nwith esophageal cancer risk.3,8 FB1 is classified\nas a group 2B possible human carcinogen by the IARC.58 High-quality data on exposure and health risks are lacking\nin humans due to difficulty in obtaining reliable and precise exposure\nassessments.3 Riley et al. hypothesized\nthat FB1 may exert human health effects (e.g., NTDs) via\nFB1 inhibition of ceramide synthase, which is an important\nenzyme involved in the synthesis of sphingolipids.41 Previous studies in animal models had demonstrated this\nto be a plausible mechanism to induce NTDs in humans.62−64 FB1 inhibition of ceramide synthase results in elevated\nlevels of sphinganine 1-phosphate (Sa 1-P) and, to a lesser extent,\nsphingosine 1-phosphate (So 1-P). Thus, Sa 1-P and the Sa 1-P:So 1-P\nratio could be used as biomarkers of effect (i.e., mechanism-based\nbiomarkers) for human exposure to FB1. Prior studies had\nvalidated the use of urinary FB1 (UFB1) as an\nexposure biomarker to fumonisins in the diet.65 Prior to these studies, blood-based biomarkers had not been used\nto measure exposure to fumonisins or to demonstrate evidence of ceramide\nsynthesis inhibition in humans.41\n\n## Methods\nIn a series of experiments, Riley et al. (2015a)\ndeveloped a DBS assay for estimating FB1 exposure by measuring\nSa 1-P and So 1-P in DBS samples using HPLC-MS/MS.41 The DBS assay was first developed and validated in a mouse\nmodel. In mice, oral administration of FB1, including at\nlevels sufficient to induce NTDs, was positively related to blood\nSa 1-P, So 1-P, and the Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratio (measured in DBS) in\na dose-dependent manner.41 Sa 1-P and the\nSa 1-P:So 1-P ratio also had a dose-dependent relationship with UFB1.41 In mice, Sa 1-P levels measured\nin DBS were positively related to Sa levels measured in target tissues,\nincluding the liver and kidneys.41 Elevated\nSa and the Sa:So ratio were also measured in embryonic tissue in mice\ngiven oral administration of FB1,41 thus supporting the mechanism by which FB1 might induce\nNTDs in vivo. After the methods were developed\nand validated in mice, the assay was applied to a small sample of\nhealthy human volunteers (n = 10) from the United\nStates. Volunteers ate maize-based food for three consecutive days\n(estimated FB1 intake: ∼2.94 μg/kg body weight\nper day). No significant changes (P < 0.05) of\nSa 1-P and So 1-P levels were detectable in DBS samples collected\nfrom these volunteers.41 Moreover, there\nwas no significant correlation between UFB1 and Sa 1-P:So\n1-P ratio across the three sampling time points (n = 25 total samples).41 Additional blood samples were obtained from\nvolunteers to conduct smaller laboratory-based experiments in which\nknown blood volumes were spotted onto DBS cards.41 From these experiments, it was determined that the LOQ\nfor Sa 1-P and So 1-P was 0.8 pmol using 8 mm DBS punches (∼15–17\nμL of blood).41 Sa 1-P and So 1-P\nlevels were detectable in spotted human blood volume extracts as low\nas 2.5 μL.41 A model was developed\nand validated for normalizing Sa 1-P and So 1-P in DBS samples by\nestimated blood volumes.41 Spotting different\nvolumes of blood onto DBS cards had no significant effects on Sa\n1-P:So 1-P ratio. Stability testing showed no significant time-dependent\ndegradation for the Sa 1-P and So 1-P biomarkers for 170 days when\nstored at −20 °C in spotted human DBS samples.41 This DBS assay was then applied in a pilot\nstudy (2010–2011)\nconducted in Guatemala to assess the feasibility of using DBS sampling\nin the field.41 In the pilot study, DBS\nsamples were collected from a total of 176 participants (n = 76 women and 100 men) from two departments (Chimaltenango and\nEscuintla) in Guatemala. Chimaltenango and Escuintla were originally\nselected to compare samples from the expected low and high FB exposure\npopulations, respectively. In other work, maize grown in hotter and\ndryer climates were determined to have higher FB contamination compared\nto maize grown at high elevations and colder climates.66 However, in this study, both Chimaltenango and\nEscuintla were ultimately determined to have low levels of FB exposure\nafter urine and maize sampling (estimated total FB intake: ∼0.41\nμg/kg of body weight per day). Subsequent analyses of DBS and\nurinary samples showed no relationship between UFB1, Sa\n1-P, So 1-P, or the Sa 1-p:So 1-P ratio in both men and women.41 The null findings of the pilot field study in\nGuatemala, as well as the small study involving volunteers from the\nUnited States, can likely be attributed to the low FB exposure levels\nof study participants. The study in the United States was also limited\nby a very small sample size (n = 10 volunteers).41 Therefore, detectable concentrations of Sa 1-P\nand So 1-P in DBS samples may only be seen among populations with\nchronically elevated FB exposures,41 especially\nif there is a threshold level above which FB inhibits ceramide synthase. In a follow-up larger field study (2011–2012), urinary and\nDBS samples were collected from a total of 1,240 women from two low-exposure\ndepartments (Chimaltenango, n = 439; Escuintla, n = 402) and one high-exposure department (Jutiapa, n = 399) in Guatemala.42 DBS\nsamples were collected from 1,233 of the study participants and used\nfor the analyses of Sa 1-P and So 1-P levels. Urine samples were collected\nat the same time points and later quantified for FB1 (UFB1). Urine and DBS samples were collected every 3 months over\na one year time frame (4 total sampling time points). Only women were\nrecruited for this study, because future work will investigate whether\nFB exposure increases the risk for NTDs. Maize in Jutiapa was determined\nto have total FB and FB1 contamination levels that were\napproximately 5–6 times higher than contamination levels in\nChimaltenango and Escuintla.66 UFB1 had a dose-dependent relationship with estimated dietary\nFB intake.66 The average UFB1 levels were in Jutiapa were 2.27 ng/mL compared to 0.38 and 0.26\nng/mL in Chimaltenango and Escuintla, respectively.66 Moreover, 75% of the study participants from the high-exposure\ndepartment (Jutiapa) were estimated to have total FB intake exceeding\n2 μg/kg body weight per day, which is considered the provisional\nmaximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI).66 These results confirm that FB exposure was higher in Jutiapa compared\nto Chimaltenango and Escuintla and that these were exposure levels\nof possible concern. Corroborating these findings, Sa 1-P concentrations,\nand Sa 1-P:So\n1-P ratios measured in DBS samples were found to be significantly\nhigher in Jutiapa compared to Chimaltenango or Escuintla.42 Individually matched DBS values of Sa 1-P and\nSa 1-P:So 1-P ratios were positively associated with UFB1 measurements,42 which provides further\nvalidation of the exposure biomarker. Moreover, these results were\ndemonstrated across sampling time points. The data reported also support\nthe hypothesis of a threshold effect by which Sa 1-P concentrations\n(>0.88 nmol/mL) and Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios (>0.36) are significantly\nassociated with elevated UFB1 concentrations above these\nthresholds.42 A confirmatory field\nstudy (February–March 2013) was conducted\nin one low exposure department (Sacatepéquez, n = 100) and two high exposure departments (Santa Rosa, n = 100, and Chiquimula, n = 99).42 A total of 299 study participants (all women) were included.\nMaize contamination levels were confirmed to be significantly higher\nin Santa Rosa and Chiquimula compared to Sacatepéquez. For\nexample, using maize sampling, the estimated average FB1 intake exceeded the PMTDI in 68% and 85% of study participants from\nSanta Rosa and Chiquimula, respectively.42 Similar FB exposure estimates were concluded from UFB1 measurements. Corroborating the prior field study, a dose-dependent\nrelationship between total FB intake and urinary FB1 was\ndemonstrated.42 Analyzing the DBS samples\n(n = 299) showed significantly higher concentrations\nof Sa 1-P and ratios of Sa 1-P:So 1-P in Chiquimula and Santa Rosa\ncompared to Sacatepéquez.42 As in\nthe prior study, individually matched Sa 1-P concentrations and Sa\n1-P and Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios were significantly correlated with UFB1 levels.42 Moreover, the results\nlargely confirmed the threshold effect reported in the previous (2011–2012)\nfield study.42 The results from these\nthree Guatemalan field studies (2010–2011\npilot study; 2011–2012; and 2012–2013) suggest that\nindividuals with UFB1 levels >0.1 ng/mL have an increased\nrisk for exceeding the PMTDI FB exposure level, while individuals\n>0.5 ng/mL will almost certainly exceed the PMTDI.42 Moreover, these studies support the hypothesis that FB1 inhibits the ceramide synthesis in humans. The next step\nwill be to investigate associations among UFB1, Sa 1-P,\nand Sa 1-P:So 1-P ratios and incident NTD cases in a prospective cohort\nstudy. The studies by Riley et al.41,42,66 demonstrated that DBS sampling is feasible for large-scale\nfield studies measuring exposure to fumonisins (with simultaneous\ncollection of urine samples). It is important to note, however, that\nFB was not directly measured in the DBS samples in these studies. The multimycotoxin assay discussed previously46 included FB1, raising the possibility of directly\nmeasuring FB1 in DBS samples in future field studies rather\nthan measuring UFB1 in urine samples. The reported LOD\nand LOQ of the DBS assay for FB1 was 0.627 ng/mL and 2.5\nng/mL, respectively.46 The average recovery\nrate was 97% in spiked DBS samples and 61% in DSS samples.46 FB1 was stable in DBS samples when\nstored at −18 °C for 24 weeks. However, significant degradation\nwas apparent when stored at 20 °C for 5 (55% recovery rate) and\n10 weeks (37% recovery rate).46 Using these\nmethods, FB1 was not detectable in DBS samples from the\nsmall German cohort discussed previously (n = 50).46 The inability to detect FB in this sample would\nbe expected, since FB exposure was likely low in this population.\nSimilar findings were reported by Riley et al. in their initial studies\namong only low-exposure groups,41 and could\nreflect inadequate sensitivity of the assay. Applying this assay to\nDBS samples collected to samples from a population with likely higher\nlevels of exposure to FB, as was done in Riley et al. (2015b),42 should be an objective for future studies. Vidal et al. spiked samples in the VTS assay with 5 different FB1\nconcentrations (10–250 ng/mL).30 Compared with the multimycotoxin DBS assay,46 this VTS assay had lower sensitivity and stability. The LODs obtained\nby the VTS assay were several times higher than the LODs obtained\nby DBS or urine assays (Table 3). While higher concentrations of spiked FB1 (50–250\nng/mL) were relatively stable (i.e., >90%), recovery rates of FB1 at lower concentrations (10 ng/mL) were <70% at 21 weeks\nwhen refrigerated at 4 °C.\n\n## Discussion\nThis review summarizes recent advances in\nmeasuring mycotoxins\nin human DBS/DSS samples and VTS. The studies reviewed have focused\non method development with applications in relatively small populations,\nwhich have not yet been applied to larger-scale population-based studies.\nWhile Riley et al. demonstrated feasibility of performing DBS sampling\nfor measuring mycotoxin exposure biomarkers in larger-scale field\nstudies,42 studies which have applied the\nmultimycotoxin DBS/DSS assay by Osteresch et al. (2017) created DSS\nsamples from venous blood.43−45 The multimycotoxin assay adapted\nfor DBS/DSS46 represents a powerful method\nto detect an array of important mycotoxin exposure biomarkers and\ncan be useful for applications in large-scale temporal biomonitoring\nand surveillance studies. Although the assay’s sensitivity\nand precision were slightly lower for OTA, the assay performed well\noverall with recoveries greater than 90% for most target analytes.46 While other multimycotoxin assays have been\ndeveloped using human blood, plasma, and urine,67−69 this was the\nfirst assay adapted for DBS/DSS analyses and had high recovery rates.10 However, the assay was applied to a population\nwith undetectable exposures for most biomarkers (except for OTA, 2’R-OTA,\nand Enniatin B) and should be validated in populations with wider\nranges of mycotoxin exposures in future studies. In addition, this\nsample46 may be underpowered and larger\nsample sizes would likely result in higher detection frequencies for\nmany of the mycotoxin biomarkers analyzed. Multimycotoxin assays30,46 should be expanded\nto include additional mycotoxins of interest, including trichothecenes,\npatulin (PAT), and citrinin (CIT), which are important mycotoxins\nfound in many legislative efforts to reduce human exposures.7 In addition, mycotoxins such as tenuazonic acid\n(TeA), produced by the Alternaria species, have been\nmeasured in DBS samples using pig’s whole blood with low levels\nof detection.70 ZEA are also important\nmycotoxins included in the multimycotoxin assays developed by Osteresch\net al.46 and Vidal et al.30 which can result in adverse reproductive effects in animals,\nincluding infertility, embryo death, and testosterone attrition.71−73 In general, blood-based biomarkers have the potential to better\ncapture long-term mycotoxin exposure, while mycotoxin exposure biomarkers\nmeasured in the urine are more representative of acute exposures.10 This is especially true for blood protein adduct\nbiomarkers (e.g., hemoglobin or albumin adducts), which reflect an\nindividual’s exposure history integrated over weeks to months.12 Currently, urine is a preferred sampling matrix\nin field studies for many analytes due to its noninvasive nature and\nacceptability among study participants.7 However, DBS sampling represents a field-friendly complement to\nurine sample collection with a high level of acceptability by study\nparticipants,74−76 especially in settings where DBS sampling has been\nused for other purposes, such as for the monitoring of HIV antiretroviral\ntreatment.77 Moreover, the use of minimally\ninvasive sampling methods may facilitate repeated sampling from the\nsame individual in longitudinal cohort studies, which allows for determining\nICCs to inform reliability of mycotoxin exposure biomarkers.40 Since many mycotoxin exposure biomarkers\nare better detected in\nblood (e.g., OTA, 2’R-OTA, EnB46) and others are better detected in urine (e.g., deoxynivalenol-3-glucoronide46 and possibly fumonisins66), the field collection of both biological specimens is optimal when\nfeasible. Table 3 shows\nthat alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), alternariol (AOH), and FB1 have high detection capacity in urine (i.e., LOD < 0.1\nng/mL) while AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and\nBEA have high detection capacity in plasma (i.e., LOD < 0.1 ng/mL).\nA multimycotoxin assay has also recently been developed for dried\nurine spots.78 Furthermore, Schmidt et\nal. (2021) incorporated online solid-phase extraction with HPLC-MS/MS\nfor detecting mycotoxins biomarkers to achieve greater analytical\nsensitivity compared to other extraction methods (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).79 With further validation and adoption of DBS sampling for\nmeasuring chronic human exposure to mycotoxins, additional research\nquestions may be pursued, such as potential additive or synergistic\neffects between mycotoxin coexposures,8,43 other environmental\nexposures (e.g., trace elements, organic pollutants, and endocrine\ndisrupting chemicals),25 and associations\nwith systems biology (e.g., using omics).10,80 In addition, animal studies have suggested that aflatoxin and fumonisins\ncoexposures can synergistically increase the risk for developing hepatocellular\ncarcinoma.4 Because coexposure to these\ntoxins are common in many countries in Africa8 and Central America, multimycotoxin assays adapted to DBS would\nhave significant epidemiologic utility. Global awareness among\nkey stakeholders is growing for strengthening\nfood safety measures by detecting and reducing mycotoxin contamination\nlevels.4,81 Methods that quantify contamination levels\nin the food supply (i.e., upstream sources) should be coupled with\nhigh-throughput, ultrasensitive, and reliable public health tools\nthat quantify levels of human exposures (i.e., downstream effects\nof contamination in the food supply). DBS sampling can extend surveillance\nto rural subsistence farming communities, which are at greatest risk\nof exposure.8 Other advantages of using\nbiological sampling compared to food sampling alone include the heterogeneous\ndistribution of mycotoxins in foodstuffs, as well as the ability to\ncapture additional routes of exposure (e.g., inhalation and intradermal)\nand contamination that might arise from methods of food preparation.43 Recent innovations in detecting mycotoxin contaminants\nin food matrices include aptasensors, which present a low-cost, high-throughput,\nultrasensitive approach for improving surveillance across the food\nsupply chain.82 A novel, complementary\napproach uses dried extract spots (DES), which allows for sample collection\nof food matrices by minimally trained personnel and centralized laboratory\nprocessing for precise quantification of contaminants.83 Future work may also seek to evaluate the interchangeability\nof capillary and venous mycotoxin biomarkers to develop point of care\n(POC) devices, as was demonstrated in a small sample size (36 reproductive\nage women in Uganda) for albumin-normalized AFB1-lysine\nadducts.57 VTS presents another minimally\ninvasive sampling technique that\nmay have utility. In particular, concentrations of AFB1 or OTA collected\nfrom VTS had higher reproducibility84 than\nthose collected from DBS (Table 2).35,48 VTS also allows for easier laboratory\nblood extraction compared to standard DBS methods.47 The use of VTS facilitates sample identification during\nextraction, but this is not the case with DBS since it cannot be identified\nonce it has been punched.85,86 Vidal et al. (2021)\nvalidated a multimycotoxin VTS ultraperformance liquid chromatography-\ntandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) assay for 24 mycotoxins, including\naflatoxins, ZEA, ochratoxins, and fumonisins (Table 3).30 For multimycotoxins\nassays, VTS requires 0.25 mL of extraction solution for sonication,30 whereas DBS requires 2 mL46 (Section S1 of the Supporting Information). VTS values were found to be stable for at least 21 days with refrigeration\nor at room temperature.30 VTS-based procedures\nhad high recovery rates and stability (Table 2), while LODs of the VTS assay were approximately\none order higher than those of the DBS- or liquid plasma-based procedures\nfor ochratoxins, aflatoxins, and fumonisins (Table 3). These method validation results suggest\nthat VTS may serve as an alternative to DBS or conventional venous\nsampling to perform quantitative screening of the exposure of these\nmycotoxins for highly exposed populations. However, future work is\nneeded to improve the detection limits of the VTS assays. At\npresent, the most significant disadvantage of VTS is its relatively\nhigh cost compared to that of DBS sampling, therefore hindering its\nability to expand HBM and environmental epidemiologic studies at scale.\nVTM is currently offered as two commercially available devices: the\nMitra device by Neoteryx (which uses patented volumetric absorptive\nmicrosampling technology; VAMS) and the TASSO-M20 device by Tasso,\nInc.87 In addition, VTS is limited to commercially\navailable sample volumes (e.g., ∼10 μL), which may not\nbe sufficient for certain biomarkers such as aflatoxin adducts to\nhuman serum albumin.47 Many DBS assays\nfor environmental exposure biomarkers (e.g., cotinine) were found\nto have minimal hematocrit effects.25,88 Among mycotoxin\nDBS assays, hematocrit effects were negligible for analyses of OTA.48 Therefore, VTS may present the greatest value\nfor therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies where\nhematocrit effects are most significant.85,89 Future work validating DBS assays should continue to investigate\nhematocrit effects and elucidate the value of VTS versus DBS/DSS sampling\non a biomarker-by-biomarker basis. Overall, the development\nof field-friendly sampling methods87,90 will facilitate\nlongitudinal cohort studies investigating mycotoxins\nand associated health risks, for which there are currently very few\nstudies.13 Due to its low cost and convenience,\nDBS sampling is well-suited for extending temporal biomonitoring and\nsurveillance studies in low-resource settings, where mycotoxin exposures\nand associated health risks are the most prevalent.10 Scaling up minimally invasive sampling methods for the\nmonitoring of population-level exposures to mycotoxins can elucidate\nglobal health inequities91,92 and direct efforts\nfor reducing population exposure levels. In regions where exposure\nto mycotoxins is endemic, exposure is lifelong and may start in utero.(3) In high-resource countries,\nlow socioeconomic status may also present increased risk for exposure\nto mycotoxins; for example, among occupants of water-damaged buildings.93,94 Importantly, multimycotoxin assays adapted to DBS/DSS analyses represent\na unique and invaluable opportunity to advance studies elucidating\nthe human “exposome”,10,95 which represents\nthe totality of human exposures from conception onward. DBS/DSS\nmultimycotoxin assays can also be applied to epidemiologic\nstudies utilizing archived newborn dried blood spots25 and in studies involving infants and young children.35 Aflatoxins are lipophilic (i.e., polar) and\ncan exert effects in utero. For example, Turner et\nal. (2007) reported that aflatoxin-albumin adducts were detected from\nhalf of the cord blood samples collected from 138 Gambian infants\nwith levels ranging from 5.0–189.6 pg/mg.96 In Gambia, aflatoxin-albumin adducts were found in more\nthan 80% of tested infants between 3 and 9 years old, and blood levels\nof aflatoxin-albumin adducts were measured up to 720 pg/mg.97−99 An important limitation of minimally invasive sampling approaches\nis the analytical challenges associated with small sample volumes,\nwhich limit the ability to analyze samples for additional biomarkers.\nThis limitation may be overcome by continued innovations in microsampling\nmethods and continued improvements in analytical sensitivity and precision\nof mass spectrometry instrumentation87,90 as well as\nmultimycotoxin assays.30,46 Advancing the science of DBS/DSS\nsampling and VTS for measuring exposure to mycotoxins and implementing\nthese approaches widely as public health tools should be a research\npriority to promote global health equity. Additional work is needed\nto identify appropriate and sustainable financing mechanisms and implementation\nstrategies to incorporate DBS/DSS sampling and VTS into global health\nsurveillance systems for monitoring population-level exposures to\nmycotoxins in regions where exposures are endemic and in regions where\nexposures are expected to increase with global climate change.16,18,54\n\n## Environmental Implications\nMinimally invasive sampling\nassays have been developed and validated\nfor important mycotoxins including ochratoxins, aflatoxins, and fumonisins.\nDBS/DSS sampling and VTS can facilitate the collection of longitudinal\nepidemiologic data on human exposure to mycotoxins and elucidate associated\nhealth risks, especially in low-resource settings. Low cost and field-friendly\n(minimally invasive) approaches are needed to evaluate mycotoxin exposures\nand direct mitigation efforts. Several of the DBS/DSS and VTS assays\ndescribed in this review have sufficient validation for deployment\nin the field (Table S2 in the Supporting Information) and should be scaled-up for surveillance efforts and population\nhealth studies. Multimycotoxin assays should be expanded to include\nother mycotoxins of interest. DBS/DSS and VTS measurements should\nbe further validated against gold-standard venous blood values, and\nstability concerns across different storage conditions (e.g., high\nheat and humidity) need to be addressed on a biomarker-by-biomarker\nbasis. Continued improvements in detection limits, reliability, and\nanalyte stability for multimycotoxin assays can facilitate widespread\nimplementation of DBS/DSS and VTS sampling to reduce global inequities\nin mycotoxin exposures.",
