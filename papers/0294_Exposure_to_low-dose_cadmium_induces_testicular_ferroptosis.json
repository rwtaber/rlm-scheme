  "abstract": "As an environmental pollutant, cadmium (Cd) has been widely reported to induce male infertility due to its gonadotoxicity. However, the specific mechanism of Cd-induced testicular damage remains unclear. We investigated whether Cd causes testicular injury through ferroptosis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to 0, 0.5, or 5 ppm Cd via drinking water, starting in utero, and continuing through 24 weeks post-weaning. The results showed that Cd accumulated in the testes in a dose-dependent manner. Cd exposure at a concentration of 5 ppm, but not 0.5 ppm, caused a mass loss and detachment of germ cells, as well as a decreased meiotic index and testis weight. Exposure to 5 ppm Cd caused iron accumulation, increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitro tyrosine (3-NT), and decreased expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and SOD2. We also found that exposure to 5 ppm Cd significantly decreased the expression of SLC7A11, a marker of ferroptosis in mice, along with the expression of SLC40A1 mRNA and ferritin heavy chain (FTH) protein, whereas there was no obvious change in the mRNA expression of Tfrc, ZIP8, ZIP14, and NCOA4. These findings indicate that 5 ppm Cd exposure increased testicular ferroptosis, which may be attributed to the reduction of stored iron export.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "As a hazardous metal, cadmium (Cd) pollution is of great concern and is becoming more severe with the continual increases of industrialization. Numerous studies have shown that water, seafood, soil, vegetables, and rice are contaminated by Cd and the general public is inevitably exposed to Cd via Cd-contaminated food, water, and air ( Ngoc et al., 2020 ;  Larson, 2014 ;  Zhou et al., 2020 ;  He et al., 2018 ). It has been reported that Cd exposure is correlated with many health disorders due to its bioaccumulation, including the global public health problem of male infertility ( Wu et al., 2016 ;  Lv et al., 2017 ;  Zhang et al., 2019 ). Numerous in vivo studies have demonstrated that Cd can accumulate in testes through long-term exposure and cause a series of adverse effects, including decreased sperm count and quality, sexual dysfunction, fetal growth restriction, and impairment of testicular development during the pubertal period ( He et al., 2018 ;  Ujah et al., 2018 ;  Blanco et al., 2010 ;  Zhang et al., 2016 ;  Ji et al., 2010 ;  Venditti et al., 2021 ;  Horri et al., 2021 ). These toxic effects are reported to correlate with the replacement of essential elements, oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetic changes ( Zhang et al., 2016 ;  Habib et al., 2019 ;  Chen et al., 2018 ;  Nakayama et al., 2019 ;  Cupertino et al., 2017 ). Nonetheless, recent studies have proposed that Cd-induced toxicity in testes is predominately due to testicular cell death ( Ola-Mudathir et al., 2008 ;  Yang et al., 2006 ).\n\nCell death is critical for and ubiquitous in animal development as it controls cell numbers, tissue shaping, and other processes like evolutionary origins ( Ghose and Shaham, 2020 ). However, excess, or pathological cell death causes injury or dysfunction to tissues and organs. Ferroptosis is a newly identified type of programmed cell death that differs from necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy, and is characterized by intracellular iron accumulation and oxidative stress ( Xie et al., 2016 ). It has been reported that ferroptosis is involved in various diseases and metal toxicity, such as diabetic osteoporosis, sepsis-induced cardiac injury, and arsenite-induced testicular toxicity, which are related to iron accumulation ( Ma et al., 2020 ;  Li et al., 2020a ;  Meng et al., 2020 ). As an essential trace element in nearly all organisms, iron is relatively stable in the body and plays an important role in various physiological processes, including the synthesis of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and some respiratory enzymes, as well as the transport and exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide ( Kim et al., 2021 ). This maintenance of iron homeostasis depends on normal iron metabolism, including iron import, utilization, storage, and export. Any change of that could affect iron homeostasis, thus causing damage to cells, tissues, and organs. Previous studies demonstrated that iron accumulation, which is caused by the enhanced expression of transferrin receptor (Tfrc) or reduced expression of ferroportin (FPN), triggers ferroptosis in cells ( Li et al., 2021 ;  Lu et al., 2021 ;  Zhao et al., 2020 ). The accumulation of iron, especially ferrous iron due to the breakdown of iron homeostasis, leads to the Fenton reaction as it responds to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by producing overwhelming lethal levels of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus inducing cell death ( Shen et al., 2018 ).\n\nIn addition, ferroptosis can be triggered by other factors, such as the cysteine to glutathione axis, lipid metabolism, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1-coenzyme Q10 pathway, and voltage-dependent anion channels 2 and 3, which contribute to oxidative damage ( Kim et al., 2021 ). Treatment with iron chelators and blocking these pathways or proteins is effective in protecting cells from ferroptosis ( Fang et al., 2019 ;  Dong et al., 2020 ). However, whether this ferroptotic cell death occurs in Cd-induced testicular damage remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that Cd exposure increased the concentration of iron in the testes along with increased lipid peroxidation, and the accumulated iron was considered to enhance testicular toxicity caused by Cd ( Kusakabe et al., 2008 ;  Djuric et al., 2015 ). These findings indicate that Cd exposure may induce damage in the testes through ferroptosis mediated by iron accumulation.\n\nThus, in this study, to mimic the general public’s exposure to Cd contamination in the environment, we exposed mice to low-doses of Cd. We aimed to investigate whether Cd exposure induces ferroptosis in testicular cells. Our results will provide new insights into the mechanisms of Cd-induced testicular damage and may open new avenues for treating male infertility, including the use of inhibitors of ferroptosis as potential therapeutic methods."

      "text": "All animal protocols and manipulations were approved by the University of Louisville’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC 18278, approved on July 20, 2018), and were in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (No. A3586-01), and the Animal Welfare Regulations promulgated by the Animal Welfare Act (OLAW), which was most recently renewed on February 2, 2018, and expires on February 28, 2022. Eight-week-old male (n = 19, 25.0 ± 1.4 g) and female (n = 51, 19.6 ± 1.3 g) parental mice (F0) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The mice were housed in a pathogen-free laboratory conditions and maintained under a 12 h light/dark cycle at 25 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 15%. Standard laboratory chow and deionized water were provided ad libitum. After two weeks of adaptive feeding, diets were changed to an AIN-76A purified diet (Envigo TD 160377, Madison, MI) and these parental mice at the age of 10-week were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Control; (2) 0.5 ppm Cd (0.5 ppm Cd in drinking water); (3) 5 ppm Cd (5 ppm Cd in drinking water). Cd stock solutions (CdCl2⋅5H2O, Alfa Aesar) were prepared with deionized water and stored at −80 °C. The Cd concentrations of 0.5 and 5 ppm were selected based on the animal welfare, statistical significance, biological relevance, and our own and other previous studies ( Saygi et al., 1991 ;  Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). According to the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), acute oral exposure to 640–1200 mg/kg Cd (mean level 890 mg/kg, e.g., 890 ppm based on the equation of 1 ppm = 1 mg/kg) is lethal to 50% (LD50) of mice ( Bellinger et al., 1992 ). Therefore, 0.5 ppm or 5 ppm Cd is about 0.07 – 0.16% of LD50 in mice based on the standard of IPCS. Additionally, within contaminated environments, Cd concentration found in surface or underground water was detected in a range from 0.025 to 6.26 ppm ( Idrees et al., 2020 ;  Ihunwo et al., 2020 ;  Selvam et al., 2021 ), which significantly exceeds the permissible limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO) ( WHO, 2016 ). Hence, in this project low-doses of Cd were used to mimic environmental Cd contamination.\n\nAt 12-weeks old, the parental mice in each group were mated at a ratio of 2 females to 1 male. Pregnant females remained exposed to Cd until their offspring were weaned. After weaning at three weeks of age, 12 male offspring (F1, 4 animals per group) were continually exposed to the same concentration of Cd as their parents for a further 24 weeks until 27 weeks of age. This was based on the animal welfare saving experimental resources policy and also our previous studies where four mice reached the level required to conduct a rigorous statistical analysis of the assesses in the different treatment groups ( Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). For these animals, body weights were monitored weekly ensuring used animals without sudden and unexpected body change. In addition, water consumption was recorded weekly.\n\nMice were sacrificed by anesthetizing with ketamine/xylazine at the end of the 27-weeks, based on by chronic toxicity experimental definition ( Xiong et al., 2021 ) and also used in previous studies from our own and others ( Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). The testes were harvested from each mouse and weighed. The right testis was stored at −80 °C to assess the oxidative stress and iron metabolism markers. The left testis was divided into two parts: one was frozen in liquid nitrogen for the determination of metal concentration and the other was fixed in 10% formalin solution for histopathological evaluation.\n\nCadmium chloride (CdCl2⋅5H2O) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA).\n\nAll other reagents are indicated in the described methods.\n\nPortions of the left testis were fixed in formalin for at least 24 h and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded testicular samples were cut into thin slices of approximately 4 μm thickness using a microtome (HM325, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sample sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard protocols and observed under an Olympus BX43 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 100 × and 400 × magnification. A semi-quantitative analysis of the rate of germ cell loss by using meiotic index (MI) was obtained, which was calculated as the number of round spermatids per pachytene spermatocyte at stage VII of the spermatogenetic cycle counted in ten round seminiferous tubule cross-sections ( Costa et al., 2017 ).\n\nTesticular tissues were digested in 70% nitric acid (HNO3; cat# A509P500, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 65 °C for 4 h. Then, the samples were diluted to 2% nitric acid with Milli-Q deionized water. Concentrations of metals were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and expressed in ng/g for Cd and in ng/mg for total iron.\n\nThe ferrous iron level in the testicular cells was assessed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (cat#K390-100, BioVision). Testicular tissues (10 mg) were homogenized on ice with 10 volumes of iron assay buffer and centrifuged at 16000g for 10 min to collect the supernatant. The supernatant (50 μL) was added to a 96-well plate and the volume was brought to 100 μL/well with iron assay buffer. This was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the samples were incubated with 100 μL iron probe/well at 37 °C for 60 min protected from light. The absorbance was measured at 593 nm using a microplate reader and expressed in nmol/mg.\n\nWestern blotting was performed according to procedures described in previous studies ( He et al., 2018 ;  Zhao et al., 2020 ). Testicular tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min to collect the proteins. Protein samples were fractionated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% skimmed milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies as follows: glutathione- peroxidase 4 (GPX4, cat#ab125066, Abcam), ferritin heavy chain (FTH, cat#ab65080, Abcam), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2, cat#sc-133134, Santa Cruz), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4, cat#sc-365230, Santa Cruz), β-actin (cat#sc-47778, Santa Cruz), solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11, cat#PA1-16893, Invitrogen), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1; cat#20507-1-AP, Proteintech), six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (STEAP3, cat#A0683, ABclonal), nitrotyrosine (3-NT, cat#N0409, Sigma-Aldrich), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, cat#ab62352, Abcam), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, cat#70081, Cell Signaling Technology). Membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG) at room temperature for 1 h and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Clarity and Clarity Max Western Enhanced Chemiluminescence Substrates, cat#1705060, Bio-Rad). The density of the protein bands was quantified using β-actin as an internal control.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA concentration was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using an RNA PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix in a LightCycler 96 RT-PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The expression levels of the target genes were normalized with those of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). All TaqMan ®  assay primers were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Grand Island, NY, USA) and were as follows: GPX4, Mm00515041_m1; SLC7A11, Mm00442530_m1; ACSL4, Mm00490331_m1; nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), Mm01219858_g1; Slc39a8 (ZIP8), Mm01320977_m1; Slc39a14 (ZIP14), Mm01317439_m1; transferrin receptor 1 (Tfrc), Mm00441941_m1; and Slc40a1(FPN1), Mm01254822_m1; GAPDH, Mm99999915_g1.\n\nParaffin-embedded slices (approximately 4 μm thick) were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated using a gradient concentration of ethanol. The slices were then immersed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. The slices were boiled in an instant pot with Tris-EDTA buffer (Tris 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM, pH 9.0) for antigen retrieval. After washing with PBST, the tissue sections were incubated with anti-NCOA4 (1:200, cat # PA5-36391, Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the tissue sections were incubated with anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase antibodies (1:500, cat#7074, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and counterstained with hematoxylin. The sections were examined under an Olympus BX43 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed. The staining intensities were analyzed using the Image-Pro Plus software.\n\nMalondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured using thiobarbituric acid reactive species assay. Testicular tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer on ice, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was quantified using the bovine serum albumin as standard. The measurement procedures were performed as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm wavelength. The MDA concentration is presented as mmol/mg protein.\n\nAll data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons among different groups were confirmed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by pair-wise repetitive comparisons using Tukey’s test. Data analysis and graph preparation were performed using the GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was set at  p  value < 0.05."

The mice from the 5 ppm Cd group, but not from 0.5 ppm Cd group, showed lower testis weight than the control group ( Fig. 1B ).\n\nHistological observation with H&E staining revealed a normal histological structure with complete spermatogenic epithelium in mice of the control group ( Fig. 2A ), whereas mice treated with 5 ppm Cd showed partial detachment of germ cells, and the testes were even devoid of spermatogenic cells ( Fig. 2C ). Exposure to 0.5 ppm Cd caused slight detachment of germ cells as clarified by a little cleft between the basal and the abluminal compartments ( Fig. 2B ). Semi-quantitative analysis showed a significantly lower MI in the 5 ppm Cd group (approximately 2.065,  p  < 0.05) than that in the control group (approximately 3.153), whereas there was no significant difference between the 0.5 ppm group (approximately 3.003) and the control ( Fig. 2D ).\n\nTesticular Cd concentrations, measured using ICP-MS, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after Cd exposure ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 3A ). In addition, 5 ppm Cd exposure caused a marked increase in the concentration of total iron and ferrous iron ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 3B ,  3C ), while 0.5 ppm Cd exposure did not cause significant change in both total iron and ferrous iron levels ( Fig. 3B ,  3C ). These different results between 0.5 ppm and 5 ppm groups may be explained by the potential threshold of Cd dose affecting the iron metabolism.\n\nComparisons among different groups were confirmed by ANOVA, the result of which showed that Cd can affect MDA content in testes (p value = 0.0179). However, the result of Tukey’s test used for pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed that compared to the control, the concentration of MDA in the testes sharply increased in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05) and trended towards an increase in the 0.5 ppm Cd group ( Fig. 4A ). In line with the MDA result, 5 ppm Cd exposure significantly upregulated the expression of 3-NT ( p  < 0.05), whereas 0.5 ppm Cd exposure tended to increase the expression ( Fig. 4B ). Meanwhile, the expression levels of antioxidants including HO-1 and SOD2 were significantly downregulated in mice treated with 5 ppm Cd ( p  < 0.05), while there was no marked change in 0.5 ppm Cd group compared to control ( Fig. 4C ,  D ). Consistent with these results, the expression of Nrf2 decreased significantly in 5 ppm Cd group and showed no significant differences in 0.5 ppm Cd group, compared to the control ( Fig. 4E ).\n\nCd exposure exerted no significant effect on either mRNA or protein expression of GPX4 ( Fig. 5A ,  B ). ANOVA analysis showed that Cd exposure can affect either the mRNA or protein expression level of SLC7A11 ( p  < 0.05). Nevertheless, the result of pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed that both the mRNA and protein expression levels of SLC7A11 were significantly downregulated in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05) but tended towards a decrease in the 0.5 ppm Cd group ( p  > 0.05), compared to the control group ( Fig. 5C ,  D ). The expression of SLC7A11 mRNA was reduced 25%, but its protein level was reduced about 75%. There was no significant difference in either mRNA or protein expression of ACSL4 between the experimental and control groups ( Fig. 5E ,  F ).\n\nSince intracellular ferrous iron was increased in the testis of 5.0 ppm-Cd treated mice, we explored whether the importation of Fe into cells was increased by examining the major extracellular ferric iron importers, Tfrc, ZIP8 (SLC39A8), and ZIP14 (SLC39A14) ( Fig. 6A ) ( Xie et al., 2016 ;  Wang et al., 2012 ). RT-PCR examination showed that neither 0.5 nor 5 ppm Cd caused significant changes in mRNA expression levels of Tfrc, SLC39A8, or SLC39A14 ( Fig. 6B – D ). These results may eliminate the potential contribution of increased importation of extracellular iron into cells. Since increased intracellular ferrous iron may be caused by the decrease in exporting function ( Fig. 6A ), we investigated the mRNA expression of its major exporter, SLC40A1 by RT-PCR. ANOVA analysis showed Cd can affect the mRNA expression of SLC40A1 ( p  < 0.05), which is responsible for iron exportation. The result of pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed significantly decreased expressions of SLC40A1 mRNA in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 6E ), but not in 0.5 ppm Cd group compared to the control ( p  > 0.05,  Fig. 6E ).\n\nImported intracellular iron is converted to ferrous iron by the metalloreductase STEAP3 after entering the endosome ( Lei et al., 2019 ), and then, ferrous iron is further released into a labile iron pool located in the cytoplasm by DMT1 for either being utilized for cell activities or being stored in ferritin ( Fig. 7A ) ( Wang et al., 2012 ;  Lei et al., 2019 ). ANOVA analysis showed that Cd exposure significantly affected the expression of STEAP3 ( p  < 0.05), which tended to increase in the 0.5 and 5 ppm groups, although pairwise comparison showed no marked difference between treatment and control groups ( Fig. 7B ). The expression of DMT1 was not significantly changed in mice exposed to either dose of Cd compared to the control group ( Fig. 7C ). However, 5 ppm Cd exposure significantly downregulated the protein expression of FTH ( Fig. 7D ), a storage form of iron ( Figs. 6A ,  7A ).\n\nA previous study showed that ferroptosis can be induced through ferritinophagy mediated by NCOA4 ( Fang et al., 2019 ). As an autophagic cargo receptor, NCOA4 targets ferritin and induces its autophagic degradation, leading to increased free iron ( Gryzik et al., 2021 ), as illustrated in  Fig. 6A . Therefore, we detected the protein expression level of NCOA4 and its location by immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 8A – D ) and mRNA expression by RT-PCR ( Fig. 8E ) to investigate whether the accumulation of iron in our model was a result of ferritinophagy. The results showed no significant difference in either protein or mRNA expression of NCOA4 among the groups ( Fig. 8 )."

      "text": "Cd may induce testicular damage by triggering cell death in the testis via apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy ( Wang et al., 2020 ;  Adamkovicova et al., 2014 ). However, whether ferroptosis, a newly identified type of cell death, is involved in Cd-induced testicular toxicity remains unclear. Distinct from apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death, ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death; the term was coined by  Dixon et al. in 2012  ( Dixon et al., 2012 ) and has been found to contribute to germ cell death ( Bromfield et al., 2019 ). Hence, we treated C57/6J mice with low-dose of Cd to investigate the potential mechanism of Cd-induced cell death in the testes.\n\nIn this study, exposure to 5 ppm Cd showed significantly reduced testis weight and detachment of germ cells in the seminiferous tubules, whereas no significant change on testis weight in the 0.5 ppm Cd group in spite of a slight detachment of germ cells was observed. This suggests that Cd induces histological damage and morphological changes in the testis at a dose threshold between 0.5 and 5 ppm, which needs further exploration in the future. In line with this, a mass of cell loss in the testis was observed in the mice exposed to 5 ppm Cd, but not 0.5 ppm, manifested by reduced MI, which represents the rate of germ cell loss during meiosis ( Costa et al., 2017 ). In our present study, the MI in the 5 ppm Cd group was approximately 2.065, indicating a nearly 50% cell loss in the testis, markedly lower than that exhibited by the control group (approximately 25%) ( Costa et al., 2017 ;  Segatelli et al., 2004 ). Germ cells are the main cells in the testis, making up the bulk of the testis weight and are responsible for sperm production ( Habib et al., 2019 ). Thus, the additional loss of germ cells caused by exposure to 5 ppm Cd may significantly contribute to the reduction of testis weight and suppression of spermatogenesis.\n\nSince ferroptosis is characterized by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation ( Stockwell et al., 2017 ), we detected the following indicators related to these processes: total iron content, ferrous iron content, SOD2, MDA, 3-NT, and HO-1. Our results showed that total iron and ferrous iron level significantly increased in the 5 ppm group but not in 0.5 ppm group. We also observed enhanced MDA levels and a sharply increased expression of 3-NT in the 5 ppm group, indicating that the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and tyrosine nitration products may be a result of the iron accumulation caused by 5 ppm Cd exposure. Interestingly, exposure to 5 ppm Cd significantly reduced the expression of HO-1, which contradicts with previous studies ( Dong et al., 2020 ;  Li et al., 2020b ). This can be explained as HO-1 plays a dual role in ferroptosis. As an inducer of ferroptosis, HO-1 increases the sources of iron by degrading heme into biliverdin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. HO-1 is also an antioxidant that has been shown to protect against oxidative damage in various stress-related conditions ( Kajarabille and Latunde-Dada, 2019 ). With the increasing oxidative stress caused by Cd exposure, the synthesized HO-1 cannot handle the excessive reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species and is quickly exhausted. Therefore, HO-1 levels were markedly decreased in the 5 ppm Cd-treated mice. A similar trend was observed for the expression level of SOD2. These results indicate that the enhanced oxidative stress and decreased levels of antioxidants may be attributed to iron accumulation, which causes massive cell death in the testes. However, the mechanisms of iron accumulation in the testes caused by Cd exposure remains unknown.\n\nStudies have revealed that the large accumulation of ferrous iron is mainly derived from the destruction of iron homeostasis, which depends on iron metabolism processes ( Zhao et al., 2020 ;  Tang et al., 2018 ). As illustrated in  Figure 9 , under physiological conditions, circulating iron (ferric iron), which binds to transferrin, is taken up by cells through Tfrc ( Xie et al., 2016 ). In addition, extracellular iron can be partially imported into cells by ZIP8 and ZIP14, which are metal transporters belonging to the ZIP family ( Wang et al., 2012 ). Subsequently, ferric iron enters the endosome and is converted to ferrous iron by the metalloreductase STEAP3 and is further released by DMT1 into a labile iron pool located in the cytoplasm ( Lei et al., 2019 ). Finally, ferrous iron can be utilized for various physiological reactions or stored in FTH, whereas excess ferrous iron is exported out of the cells by the membrane protein FPN1 ( Xie et al., 2016 ;  Lei et al., 2019 ). Thus, any change in the iron metabolism pathways may affect the initiation of ferroptosis. In the present study, our results showed that Cd exposure either at the dose of 0.5 or 5 ppm did not cause any change in the expression of Tfrc, ZIP8, and ZIP14, suggesting that the import of iron into cells was not affected by Cd exposure. In contrast, the expression of FTH and FPN1 was markedly downregulated by exposure to 5 ppm Cd, suggesting that Cd-induced iron accumulation may be mainly caused by reduced storage and the exportation of iron. Interestingly, the expression of STEAP3 was significantly enhanced in the 5 ppm Cd group, indicating that the transport of iron was in an activated state during the requirement for intracellular ferrous iron. Nevertheless, previous studies have reported that several inducers or diseases cause ferroptosis through ferritinophagy mediated by NCOA4 ( Li et al., 2020a ;  Gryzik et al., 2021 ); however, our results showed no significant change in the expression of NCOA4 between experimental and control groups, indicating that Cd-induced accumulation of iron is not related to ferritinophagy. Taken together, these findings show that the Cd-induced disturbance of iron homeostasis was probably caused by the reduced exportation and storage of iron ( Fig. 9 ).\n\nFurthermore, given that ferroptosis can be regulated by lipid metabolism, GPX4, and SLC7A11 ( Fig. 9 ), we further detected the mRNA and protein expression levels of ACSL4, SLC7A11, and GPX4 in testis. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expressions of ACSL4 did not change significantly in the treated groups, which indicates that Cd-triggered ferroptosis may be independent of ACSL4 although we did not measure its activity. In addition, our results identified no significant change in both mRNA and protein expressions of GPX4 in the 0.5 and 5 ppm Cd groups, which is not consistent with the decreased expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and SOD2 in the present study. This inconsistence may be due to the fact that although GPX4 is one of Nrf2 downstream genes, Nrf2 is not the only one to regulate GPX4 expression. Several other transcriptional factors also regulate the expression of GPX4 such as zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), cAMP-response element modulator (CREM), and transcription factor AP-2c (TFAP2c) ( Han et al., 2021 ;  Wang et al., 2021 ;  Alim et al., 2019 ). Hence, Cd-triggered lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis may be independent of GPX4 activity. In the present study, we showed that the mRNA expression of SLC7A11 was reduced by about 25% with protein expression reduced by about 75% in mice treated with 5 ppm Cd. The significantly reduced protein level may result in significant reduction of SLC7A11 function, a pathway responsible for ferroptosis inhibition. It may need to notice that although GPX4 is the predominant pathway to inhibit phospholipid peroxidation and suppress ferroptosis, here the induction of ferroptosis by exposure to 5 ppm Cd seems not mainly due to the lose of its suppressive effect, which, however, is due to other GPX4-independent pathway as reported recently ( Kraft et al., 2020 ;  Bersuker et al., 2019 ;  Dar et al., 2021 ), needs to be further exposured in the future study. Considering the fact that ALOX12-mediated tumor suppression via P53-mediated ferroptosis, in which SLC7A11 is inhibited without GPX4 significant alteration ( Chu et al., 2019 ), we assume that the downregulation of SLC7A11 may partly contribute to the ferroptosis induced by Cd-mediated oxidative stress.\n\nThere are some limitations to our study. First, we lack the information of mitochondrial morphology and so the results were not included. Second, we didn’t conduct cell experiments treated with inhibitor of ferroptosis to further verify Cd-induced ferroptosis. Third, the specific pathway related to Cd-induced ferroptosis remains to illustrated.\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrated for the first time that ferroptosis may be a novel type of testicular cell death caused by Cd exposure. Cd-induced ferroptosis in the testes was mainly achieved by reducing the export and storage of iron and partially by inhibiting sSLC7A11 function. Our study provided new insights into the mechanism of Cd-induced testicular toxicity."

  "full_text": "As an environmental pollutant, cadmium (Cd) has been widely reported to induce male infertility due to its gonadotoxicity. However, the specific mechanism of Cd-induced testicular damage remains unclear. We investigated whether Cd causes testicular injury through ferroptosis. Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to 0, 0.5, or 5 ppm Cd via drinking water, starting in utero, and continuing through 24 weeks post-weaning. The results showed that Cd accumulated in the testes in a dose-dependent manner. Cd exposure at a concentration of 5 ppm, but not 0.5 ppm, caused a mass loss and detachment of germ cells, as well as a decreased meiotic index and testis weight. Exposure to 5 ppm Cd caused iron accumulation, increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitro tyrosine (3-NT), and decreased expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and SOD2. We also found that exposure to 5 ppm Cd significantly decreased the expression of SLC7A11, a marker of ferroptosis in mice, along with the expression of SLC40A1 mRNA and ferritin heavy chain (FTH) protein, whereas there was no obvious change in the mRNA expression of Tfrc, ZIP8, ZIP14, and NCOA4. These findings indicate that 5 ppm Cd exposure increased testicular ferroptosis, which may be attributed to the reduction of stored iron export.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs a hazardous metal, cadmium (Cd) pollution is of great concern and is becoming more severe with the continual increases of industrialization. Numerous studies have shown that water, seafood, soil, vegetables, and rice are contaminated by Cd and the general public is inevitably exposed to Cd via Cd-contaminated food, water, and air ( Ngoc et al., 2020 ;  Larson, 2014 ;  Zhou et al., 2020 ;  He et al., 2018 ). It has been reported that Cd exposure is correlated with many health disorders due to its bioaccumulation, including the global public health problem of male infertility ( Wu et al., 2016 ;  Lv et al., 2017 ;  Zhang et al., 2019 ). Numerous in vivo studies have demonstrated that Cd can accumulate in testes through long-term exposure and cause a series of adverse effects, including decreased sperm count and quality, sexual dysfunction, fetal growth restriction, and impairment of testicular development during the pubertal period ( He et al., 2018 ;  Ujah et al., 2018 ;  Blanco et al., 2010 ;  Zhang et al., 2016 ;  Ji et al., 2010 ;  Venditti et al., 2021 ;  Horri et al., 2021 ). These toxic effects are reported to correlate with the replacement of essential elements, oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetic changes ( Zhang et al., 2016 ;  Habib et al., 2019 ;  Chen et al., 2018 ;  Nakayama et al., 2019 ;  Cupertino et al., 2017 ). Nonetheless, recent studies have proposed that Cd-induced toxicity in testes is predominately due to testicular cell death ( Ola-Mudathir et al., 2008 ;  Yang et al., 2006 ).\n\nCell death is critical for and ubiquitous in animal development as it controls cell numbers, tissue shaping, and other processes like evolutionary origins ( Ghose and Shaham, 2020 ). However, excess, or pathological cell death causes injury or dysfunction to tissues and organs. Ferroptosis is a newly identified type of programmed cell death that differs from necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy, and is characterized by intracellular iron accumulation and oxidative stress ( Xie et al., 2016 ). It has been reported that ferroptosis is involved in various diseases and metal toxicity, such as diabetic osteoporosis, sepsis-induced cardiac injury, and arsenite-induced testicular toxicity, which are related to iron accumulation ( Ma et al., 2020 ;  Li et al., 2020a ;  Meng et al., 2020 ). As an essential trace element in nearly all organisms, iron is relatively stable in the body and plays an important role in various physiological processes, including the synthesis of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and some respiratory enzymes, as well as the transport and exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide ( Kim et al., 2021 ). This maintenance of iron homeostasis depends on normal iron metabolism, including iron import, utilization, storage, and export. Any change of that could affect iron homeostasis, thus causing damage to cells, tissues, and organs. Previous studies demonstrated that iron accumulation, which is caused by the enhanced expression of transferrin receptor (Tfrc) or reduced expression of ferroportin (FPN), triggers ferroptosis in cells ( Li et al., 2021 ;  Lu et al., 2021 ;  Zhao et al., 2020 ). The accumulation of iron, especially ferrous iron due to the breakdown of iron homeostasis, leads to the Fenton reaction as it responds to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by producing overwhelming lethal levels of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus inducing cell death ( Shen et al., 2018 ).\n\nIn addition, ferroptosis can be triggered by other factors, such as the cysteine to glutathione axis, lipid metabolism, ferroptosis suppressor protein 1-coenzyme Q10 pathway, and voltage-dependent anion channels 2 and 3, which contribute to oxidative damage ( Kim et al., 2021 ). Treatment with iron chelators and blocking these pathways or proteins is effective in protecting cells from ferroptosis ( Fang et al., 2019 ;  Dong et al., 2020 ). However, whether this ferroptotic cell death occurs in Cd-induced testicular damage remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that Cd exposure increased the concentration of iron in the testes along with increased lipid peroxidation, and the accumulated iron was considered to enhance testicular toxicity caused by Cd ( Kusakabe et al., 2008 ;  Djuric et al., 2015 ). These findings indicate that Cd exposure may induce damage in the testes through ferroptosis mediated by iron accumulation.\n\nThus, in this study, to mimic the general public’s exposure to Cd contamination in the environment, we exposed mice to low-doses of Cd. We aimed to investigate whether Cd exposure induces ferroptosis in testicular cells. Our results will provide new insights into the mechanisms of Cd-induced testicular damage and may open new avenues for treating male infertility, including the use of inhibitors of ferroptosis as potential therapeutic methods.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\nAll animal protocols and manipulations were approved by the University of Louisville’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC 18278, approved on July 20, 2018), and were in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (No. A3586-01), and the Animal Welfare Regulations promulgated by the Animal Welfare Act (OLAW), which was most recently renewed on February 2, 2018, and expires on February 28, 2022. Eight-week-old male (n = 19, 25.0 ± 1.4 g) and female (n = 51, 19.6 ± 1.3 g) parental mice (F0) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The mice were housed in a pathogen-free laboratory conditions and maintained under a 12 h light/dark cycle at 25 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 15%. Standard laboratory chow and deionized water were provided ad libitum. After two weeks of adaptive feeding, diets were changed to an AIN-76A purified diet (Envigo TD 160377, Madison, MI) and these parental mice at the age of 10-week were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Control; (2) 0.5 ppm Cd (0.5 ppm Cd in drinking water); (3) 5 ppm Cd (5 ppm Cd in drinking water). Cd stock solutions (CdCl2⋅5H2O, Alfa Aesar) were prepared with deionized water and stored at −80 °C. The Cd concentrations of 0.5 and 5 ppm were selected based on the animal welfare, statistical significance, biological relevance, and our own and other previous studies ( Saygi et al., 1991 ;  Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). According to the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), acute oral exposure to 640–1200 mg/kg Cd (mean level 890 mg/kg, e.g., 890 ppm based on the equation of 1 ppm = 1 mg/kg) is lethal to 50% (LD50) of mice ( Bellinger et al., 1992 ). Therefore, 0.5 ppm or 5 ppm Cd is about 0.07 – 0.16% of LD50 in mice based on the standard of IPCS. Additionally, within contaminated environments, Cd concentration found in surface or underground water was detected in a range from 0.025 to 6.26 ppm ( Idrees et al., 2020 ;  Ihunwo et al., 2020 ;  Selvam et al., 2021 ), which significantly exceeds the permissible limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO) ( WHO, 2016 ). Hence, in this project low-doses of Cd were used to mimic environmental Cd contamination.\n\nAt 12-weeks old, the parental mice in each group were mated at a ratio of 2 females to 1 male. Pregnant females remained exposed to Cd until their offspring were weaned. After weaning at three weeks of age, 12 male offspring (F1, 4 animals per group) were continually exposed to the same concentration of Cd as their parents for a further 24 weeks until 27 weeks of age. This was based on the animal welfare saving experimental resources policy and also our previous studies where four mice reached the level required to conduct a rigorous statistical analysis of the assesses in the different treatment groups ( Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). For these animals, body weights were monitored weekly ensuring used animals without sudden and unexpected body change. In addition, water consumption was recorded weekly.\n\nMice were sacrificed by anesthetizing with ketamine/xylazine at the end of the 27-weeks, based on by chronic toxicity experimental definition ( Xiong et al., 2021 ) and also used in previous studies from our own and others ( Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). The testes were harvested from each mouse and weighed. The right testis was stored at −80 °C to assess the oxidative stress and iron metabolism markers. The left testis was divided into two parts: one was frozen in liquid nitrogen for the determination of metal concentration and the other was fixed in 10% formalin solution for histopathological evaluation.\n\nCadmium chloride (CdCl2⋅5H2O) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA).\n\nAll other reagents are indicated in the described methods.\n\nPortions of the left testis were fixed in formalin for at least 24 h and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded testicular samples were cut into thin slices of approximately 4 μm thickness using a microtome (HM325, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sample sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard protocols and observed under an Olympus BX43 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 100 × and 400 × magnification. A semi-quantitative analysis of the rate of germ cell loss by using meiotic index (MI) was obtained, which was calculated as the number of round spermatids per pachytene spermatocyte at stage VII of the spermatogenetic cycle counted in ten round seminiferous tubule cross-sections ( Costa et al., 2017 ).\n\nTesticular tissues were digested in 70% nitric acid (HNO3; cat# A509P500, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 65 °C for 4 h. Then, the samples were diluted to 2% nitric acid with Milli-Q deionized water. Concentrations of metals were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and expressed in ng/g for Cd and in ng/mg for total iron.\n\nThe ferrous iron level in the testicular cells was assessed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (cat#K390-100, BioVision). Testicular tissues (10 mg) were homogenized on ice with 10 volumes of iron assay buffer and centrifuged at 16000g for 10 min to collect the supernatant. The supernatant (50 μL) was added to a 96-well plate and the volume was brought to 100 μL/well with iron assay buffer. This was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, the samples were incubated with 100 μL iron probe/well at 37 °C for 60 min protected from light. The absorbance was measured at 593 nm using a microplate reader and expressed in nmol/mg.\n\nWestern blotting was performed according to procedures described in previous studies ( He et al., 2018 ;  Zhao et al., 2020 ). Testicular tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min to collect the proteins. Protein samples were fractionated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% skimmed milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies as follows: glutathione- peroxidase 4 (GPX4, cat#ab125066, Abcam), ferritin heavy chain (FTH, cat#ab65080, Abcam), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2, cat#sc-133134, Santa Cruz), acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4, cat#sc-365230, Santa Cruz), β-actin (cat#sc-47778, Santa Cruz), solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11, cat#PA1-16893, Invitrogen), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1; cat#20507-1-AP, Proteintech), six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (STEAP3, cat#A0683, ABclonal), nitrotyrosine (3-NT, cat#N0409, Sigma-Aldrich), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, cat#ab62352, Abcam), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, cat#70081, Cell Signaling Technology). Membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG) at room temperature for 1 h and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Clarity and Clarity Max Western Enhanced Chemiluminescence Substrates, cat#1705060, Bio-Rad). The density of the protein bands was quantified using β-actin as an internal control.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA concentration was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using an RNA PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-PCR analysis was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix in a LightCycler 96 RT-PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The expression levels of the target genes were normalized with those of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). All TaqMan ®  assay primers were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Grand Island, NY, USA) and were as follows: GPX4, Mm00515041_m1; SLC7A11, Mm00442530_m1; ACSL4, Mm00490331_m1; nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), Mm01219858_g1; Slc39a8 (ZIP8), Mm01320977_m1; Slc39a14 (ZIP14), Mm01317439_m1; transferrin receptor 1 (Tfrc), Mm00441941_m1; and Slc40a1(FPN1), Mm01254822_m1; GAPDH, Mm99999915_g1.\n\nParaffin-embedded slices (approximately 4 μm thick) were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated using a gradient concentration of ethanol. The slices were then immersed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. The slices were boiled in an instant pot with Tris-EDTA buffer (Tris 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM, pH 9.0) for antigen retrieval. After washing with PBST, the tissue sections were incubated with anti-NCOA4 (1:200, cat # PA5-36391, Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the tissue sections were incubated with anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase antibodies (1:500, cat#7074, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and counterstained with hematoxylin. The sections were examined under an Olympus BX43 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed. The staining intensities were analyzed using the Image-Pro Plus software.\n\nMalondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured using thiobarbituric acid reactive species assay. Testicular tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer on ice, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was quantified using the bovine serum albumin as standard. The measurement procedures were performed as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm wavelength. The MDA concentration is presented as mmol/mg protein.\n\nAll data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons among different groups were confirmed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by pair-wise repetitive comparisons using Tukey’s test. Data analysis and graph preparation were performed using the GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was set at  p  value < 0.05.\n\n## Animals and experimental design\n\nAll animal protocols and manipulations were approved by the University of Louisville’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC 18278, approved on July 20, 2018), and were in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (No. A3586-01), and the Animal Welfare Regulations promulgated by the Animal Welfare Act (OLAW), which was most recently renewed on February 2, 2018, and expires on February 28, 2022. Eight-week-old male (n = 19, 25.0 ± 1.4 g) and female (n = 51, 19.6 ± 1.3 g) parental mice (F0) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. The mice were housed in a pathogen-free laboratory conditions and maintained under a 12 h light/dark cycle at 25 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 15%. Standard laboratory chow and deionized water were provided ad libitum. After two weeks of adaptive feeding, diets were changed to an AIN-76A purified diet (Envigo TD 160377, Madison, MI) and these parental mice at the age of 10-week were randomly divided into three groups: (1) Control; (2) 0.5 ppm Cd (0.5 ppm Cd in drinking water); (3) 5 ppm Cd (5 ppm Cd in drinking water). Cd stock solutions (CdCl2⋅5H2O, Alfa Aesar) were prepared with deionized water and stored at −80 °C. The Cd concentrations of 0.5 and 5 ppm were selected based on the animal welfare, statistical significance, biological relevance, and our own and other previous studies ( Saygi et al., 1991 ;  Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). According to the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), acute oral exposure to 640–1200 mg/kg Cd (mean level 890 mg/kg, e.g., 890 ppm based on the equation of 1 ppm = 1 mg/kg) is lethal to 50% (LD50) of mice ( Bellinger et al., 1992 ). Therefore, 0.5 ppm or 5 ppm Cd is about 0.07 – 0.16% of LD50 in mice based on the standard of IPCS. Additionally, within contaminated environments, Cd concentration found in surface or underground water was detected in a range from 0.025 to 6.26 ppm ( Idrees et al., 2020 ;  Ihunwo et al., 2020 ;  Selvam et al., 2021 ), which significantly exceeds the permissible limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO) ( WHO, 2016 ). Hence, in this project low-doses of Cd were used to mimic environmental Cd contamination.\n\nAt 12-weeks old, the parental mice in each group were mated at a ratio of 2 females to 1 male. Pregnant females remained exposed to Cd until their offspring were weaned. After weaning at three weeks of age, 12 male offspring (F1, 4 animals per group) were continually exposed to the same concentration of Cd as their parents for a further 24 weeks until 27 weeks of age. This was based on the animal welfare saving experimental resources policy and also our previous studies where four mice reached the level required to conduct a rigorous statistical analysis of the assesses in the different treatment groups ( Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). For these animals, body weights were monitored weekly ensuring used animals without sudden and unexpected body change. In addition, water consumption was recorded weekly.\n\nMice were sacrificed by anesthetizing with ketamine/xylazine at the end of the 27-weeks, based on by chronic toxicity experimental definition ( Xiong et al., 2021 ) and also used in previous studies from our own and others ( Young et al., 2019 ;  Zhou et al., 2021 ;  Xiong et al., 2022 ). The testes were harvested from each mouse and weighed. The right testis was stored at −80 °C to assess the oxidative stress and iron metabolism markers. The left testis was divided into two parts: one was frozen in liquid nitrogen for the determination of metal concentration and the other was fixed in 10% formalin solution for histopathological evaluation.\n\n## Chemicals and reagents\n\nCadmium chloride (CdCl2⋅5H2O) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA).\n\nAll other reagents are indicated in the described methods.\n\n## Histological evaluation of testes\n\nPortions of the left testis were fixed in formalin for at least 24 h and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded testicular samples were cut into thin slices of approximately 4 μm thickness using a microtome (HM325, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sample sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard protocols and observed under an Olympus BX43 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at 100 × and 400 × magnification.

Then, the samples were diluted to 2% nitric acid with Milli-Q deionized water. Concentrations of metals were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and expressed in ng/g for Cd and in ng/mg for total iron.\n\n## Ferrous iron assay in testis\n\nThe ferrous iron level in the testicular cells was assessed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (cat#K390-100, BioVision). Testicular tissues (10 mg) were homogenized on ice with 10 volumes of iron assay buffer and centrifuged at 16000g for 10 min to collect the supernatant. The supernatant (50 μL) was added to a 96-well plate and the volume was brought to 100 μL/well with iron assay buffer. This was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min.

Membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG) at room temperature for 1 h and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Clarity and Clarity Max Western Enhanced Chemiluminescence Substrates, cat#1705060, Bio-Rad). The density of the protein bands was quantified using β-actin as an internal control.\n\n## Real-time PCR (RT-PCR)\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA concentration was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using an RNA PCR kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

The slices were then immersed in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. The slices were boiled in an instant pot with Tris-EDTA buffer (Tris 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM, pH 9.0) for antigen retrieval.

The sections were examined under an Olympus BX43 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed. The staining intensities were analyzed using the Image-Pro Plus software.\n\n## Assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels\n\nMalondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured using thiobarbituric acid reactive species assay. Testicular tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer on ice, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was quantified using the bovine serum albumin as standard. The measurement procedures were performed as described previously ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm wavelength. The MDA concentration is presented as mmol/mg protein.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nAll data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons among different groups were confirmed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by pair-wise repetitive comparisons using Tukey’s test. Data analysis and graph preparation were performed using the GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was set at  p  value < 0.05.\n\n## Results\n\nThe offspring body weights showed age-dependent increase and were not significantly different among groups ( Fig. 1A ). The mice from the 5 ppm Cd group, but not from 0.5 ppm Cd group, showed lower testis weight than the control group ( Fig. 1B ).\n\nHistological observation with H&E staining revealed a normal histological structure with complete spermatogenic epithelium in mice of the control group ( Fig. 2A ), whereas mice treated with 5 ppm Cd showed partial detachment of germ cells, and the testes were even devoid of spermatogenic cells ( Fig. 2C ). Exposure to 0.5 ppm Cd caused slight detachment of germ cells as clarified by a little cleft between the basal and the abluminal compartments ( Fig. 2B ). Semi-quantitative analysis showed a significantly lower MI in the 5 ppm Cd group (approximately 2.065,  p  < 0.05) than that in the control group (approximately 3.153), whereas there was no significant difference between the 0.5 ppm group (approximately 3.003) and the control ( Fig. 2D ).\n\nTesticular Cd concentrations, measured using ICP-MS, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after Cd exposure ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 3A ). In addition, 5 ppm Cd exposure caused a marked increase in the concentration of total iron and ferrous iron ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 3B ,  3C ), while 0.5 ppm Cd exposure did not cause significant change in both total iron and ferrous iron levels ( Fig. 3B ,  3C ). These different results between 0.5 ppm and 5 ppm groups may be explained by the potential threshold of Cd dose affecting the iron metabolism.\n\nComparisons among different groups were confirmed by ANOVA, the result of which showed that Cd can affect MDA content in testes (p value = 0.0179). However, the result of Tukey’s test used for pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed that compared to the control, the concentration of MDA in the testes sharply increased in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05) and trended towards an increase in the 0.5 ppm Cd group ( Fig. 4A ). In line with the MDA result, 5 ppm Cd exposure significantly upregulated the expression of 3-NT ( p  < 0.05), whereas 0.5 ppm Cd exposure tended to increase the expression ( Fig. 4B ). Meanwhile, the expression levels of antioxidants including HO-1 and SOD2 were significantly downregulated in mice treated with 5 ppm Cd ( p  < 0.05), while there was no marked change in 0.5 ppm Cd group compared to control ( Fig. 4C ,  D ). Consistent with these results, the expression of Nrf2 decreased significantly in 5 ppm Cd group and showed no significant differences in 0.5 ppm Cd group, compared to the control ( Fig. 4E ).\n\nCd exposure exerted no significant effect on either mRNA or protein expression of GPX4 ( Fig. 5A ,  B ). ANOVA analysis showed that Cd exposure can affect either the mRNA or protein expression level of SLC7A11 ( p  < 0.05). Nevertheless, the result of pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed that both the mRNA and protein expression levels of SLC7A11 were significantly downregulated in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05) but tended towards a decrease in the 0.5 ppm Cd group ( p  > 0.05), compared to the control group ( Fig. 5C ,  D ). The expression of SLC7A11 mRNA was reduced 25%, but its protein level was reduced about 75%. There was no significant difference in either mRNA or protein expression of ACSL4 between the experimental and control groups ( Fig. 5E ,  F ).\n\nSince intracellular ferrous iron was increased in the testis of 5.0 ppm-Cd treated mice, we explored whether the importation of Fe into cells was increased by examining the major extracellular ferric iron importers, Tfrc, ZIP8 (SLC39A8), and ZIP14 (SLC39A14) ( Fig. 6A ) ( Xie et al., 2016 ;  Wang et al., 2012 ). RT-PCR examination showed that neither 0.5 nor 5 ppm Cd caused significant changes in mRNA expression levels of Tfrc, SLC39A8, or SLC39A14 ( Fig. 6B – D ). These results may eliminate the potential contribution of increased importation of extracellular iron into cells. Since increased intracellular ferrous iron may be caused by the decrease in exporting function ( Fig. 6A ), we investigated the mRNA expression of its major exporter, SLC40A1 by RT-PCR. ANOVA analysis showed Cd can affect the mRNA expression of SLC40A1 ( p  < 0.05), which is responsible for iron exportation. The result of pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed significantly decreased expressions of SLC40A1 mRNA in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 6E ), but not in 0.5 ppm Cd group compared to the control ( p  > 0.05,  Fig. 6E ).\n\nImported intracellular iron is converted to ferrous iron by the metalloreductase STEAP3 after entering the endosome ( Lei et al., 2019 ), and then, ferrous iron is further released into a labile iron pool located in the cytoplasm by DMT1 for either being utilized for cell activities or being stored in ferritin ( Fig. 7A ) ( Wang et al., 2012 ;  Lei et al., 2019 ). ANOVA analysis showed that Cd exposure significantly affected the expression of STEAP3 ( p  < 0.05), which tended to increase in the 0.5 and 5 ppm groups, although pairwise comparison showed no marked difference between treatment and control groups ( Fig. 7B ). The expression of DMT1 was not significantly changed in mice exposed to either dose of Cd compared to the control group ( Fig. 7C ). However, 5 ppm Cd exposure significantly downregulated the protein expression of FTH ( Fig. 7D ), a storage form of iron ( Figs. 6A ,  7A ).\n\nA previous study showed that ferroptosis can be induced through ferritinophagy mediated by NCOA4 ( Fang et al., 2019 ). As an autophagic cargo receptor, NCOA4 targets ferritin and induces its autophagic degradation, leading to increased free iron ( Gryzik et al., 2021 ), as illustrated in  Fig. 6A . Therefore, we detected the protein expression level of NCOA4 and its location by immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 8A – D ) and mRNA expression by RT-PCR ( Fig. 8E ) to investigate whether the accumulation of iron in our model was a result of ferritinophagy. The results showed no significant difference in either protein or mRNA expression of NCOA4 among the groups ( Fig. 8 ).\n\n## Effects of Cd on morphometry and testicular histology\n\nThe offspring body weights showed age-dependent increase and were not significantly different among groups ( Fig. 1A ). The mice from the 5 ppm Cd group, but not from 0.5 ppm Cd group, showed lower testis weight than the control group ( Fig. 1B ).\n\nHistological observation with H&E staining revealed a normal histological structure with complete spermatogenic epithelium in mice of the control group ( Fig. 2A ), whereas mice treated with 5 ppm Cd showed partial detachment of germ cells, and the testes were even devoid of spermatogenic cells ( Fig. 2C ). Exposure to 0.5 ppm Cd caused slight detachment of germ cells as clarified by a little cleft between the basal and the abluminal compartments ( Fig. 2B ). Semi-quantitative analysis showed a significantly lower MI in the 5 ppm Cd group (approximately 2.065,  p  < 0.05) than that in the control group (approximately 3.153), whereas there was no significant difference between the 0.5 ppm group (approximately 3.003) and the control ( Fig. 2D ).\n\n## Effects of Cd on the concentration of iron in the testes\n\nTesticular Cd concentrations, measured using ICP-MS, significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner after Cd exposure ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 3A ). In addition, 5 ppm Cd exposure caused a marked increase in the concentration of total iron and ferrous iron ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 3B ,  3C ), while 0.5 ppm Cd exposure did not cause significant change in both total iron and ferrous iron levels ( Fig. 3B ,  3C ). These different results between 0.5 ppm and 5 ppm groups may be explained by the potential threshold of Cd dose affecting the iron metabolism.\n\n## Effects of Cd on oxidative stress and several proteins related to ferroptosis in testes\n\nComparisons among different groups were confirmed by ANOVA, the result of which showed that Cd can affect MDA content in testes (p value = 0.0179). However, the result of Tukey’s test used for pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed that compared to the control, the concentration of MDA in the testes sharply increased in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05) and trended towards an increase in the 0.5 ppm Cd group ( Fig. 4A ). In line with the MDA result, 5 ppm Cd exposure significantly upregulated the expression of 3-NT ( p  < 0.05), whereas 0.5 ppm Cd exposure tended to increase the expression ( Fig. 4B ). Meanwhile, the expression levels of antioxidants including HO-1 and SOD2 were significantly downregulated in mice treated with 5 ppm Cd ( p  < 0.05), while there was no marked change in 0.5 ppm Cd group compared to control ( Fig. 4C ,  D ). Consistent with these results, the expression of Nrf2 decreased significantly in 5 ppm Cd group and showed no significant differences in 0.5 ppm Cd group, compared to the control ( Fig. 4E ).\n\nCd exposure exerted no significant effect on either mRNA or protein expression of GPX4 ( Fig. 5A ,  B ). ANOVA analysis showed that Cd exposure can affect either the mRNA or protein expression level of SLC7A11 ( p  < 0.05). Nevertheless, the result of pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed that both the mRNA and protein expression levels of SLC7A11 were significantly downregulated in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05) but tended towards a decrease in the 0.5 ppm Cd group ( p  > 0.05), compared to the control group ( Fig. 5C ,  D ). The expression of SLC7A11 mRNA was reduced 25%, but its protein level was reduced about 75%. There was no significant difference in either mRNA or protein expression of ACSL4 between the experimental and control groups ( Fig. 5E ,  F ).\n\n## Effects of Cd on iron metabolism pathways\n\nSince intracellular ferrous iron was increased in the testis of 5.0 ppm-Cd treated mice, we explored whether the importation of Fe into cells was increased by examining the major extracellular ferric iron importers, Tfrc, ZIP8 (SLC39A8), and ZIP14 (SLC39A14) ( Fig. 6A ) ( Xie et al., 2016 ;  Wang et al., 2012 ). RT-PCR examination showed that neither 0.5 nor 5 ppm Cd caused significant changes in mRNA expression levels of Tfrc, SLC39A8, or SLC39A14 ( Fig. 6B – D ). These results may eliminate the potential contribution of increased importation of extracellular iron into cells. Since increased intracellular ferrous iron may be caused by the decrease in exporting function ( Fig. 6A ), we investigated the mRNA expression of its major exporter, SLC40A1 by RT-PCR. ANOVA analysis showed Cd can affect the mRNA expression of SLC40A1 ( p  < 0.05), which is responsible for iron exportation. The result of pair-wise repetitive comparisons showed significantly decreased expressions of SLC40A1 mRNA in the 5 ppm Cd group ( p  < 0.05,  Fig. 6E ), but not in 0.5 ppm Cd group compared to the control ( p  > 0.05,  Fig. 6E ).\n\nImported intracellular iron is converted to ferrous iron by the metalloreductase STEAP3 after entering the endosome ( Lei et al., 2019 ), and then, ferrous iron is further released into a labile iron pool located in the cytoplasm by DMT1 for either being utilized for cell activities or being stored in ferritin ( Fig. 7A ) ( Wang et al., 2012 ;  Lei et al., 2019 ). ANOVA analysis showed that Cd exposure significantly affected the expression of STEAP3 ( p  < 0.05), which tended to increase in the 0.5 and 5 ppm groups, although pairwise comparison showed no marked difference between treatment and control groups ( Fig. 7B ). The expression of DMT1 was not significantly changed in mice exposed to either dose of Cd compared to the control group ( Fig. 7C ). However, 5 ppm Cd exposure significantly downregulated the protein expression of FTH ( Fig. 7D ), a storage form of iron ( Figs. 6A ,  7A ).\n\nA previous study showed that ferroptosis can be induced through ferritinophagy mediated by NCOA4 ( Fang et al., 2019 ). As an autophagic cargo receptor, NCOA4 targets ferritin and induces its autophagic degradation, leading to increased free iron ( Gryzik et al., 2021 ), as illustrated in  Fig. 6A . Therefore, we detected the protein expression level of NCOA4 and its location by immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 8A – D ) and mRNA expression by RT-PCR ( Fig. 8E ) to investigate whether the accumulation of iron in our model was a result of ferritinophagy. The results showed no significant difference in either protein or mRNA expression of NCOA4 among the groups ( Fig. 8 ).\n\n## Discussion\n\nCd may induce testicular damage by triggering cell death in the testis via apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy ( Wang et al., 2020 ;  Adamkovicova et al., 2014 ). However, whether ferroptosis, a newly identified type of cell death, is involved in Cd-induced testicular toxicity remains unclear. Distinct from apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death, ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death; the term was coined by  Dixon et al. in 2012  ( Dixon et al., 2012 ) and has been found to contribute to germ cell death ( Bromfield et al., 2019 ). Hence, we treated C57/6J mice with low-dose of Cd to investigate the potential mechanism of Cd-induced cell death in the testes.\n\nIn this study, exposure to 5 ppm Cd showed significantly reduced testis weight and detachment of germ cells in the seminiferous tubules, whereas no significant change on testis weight in the 0.5 ppm Cd group in spite of a slight detachment of germ cells was observed. This suggests that Cd induces histological damage and morphological changes in the testis at a dose threshold between 0.5 and 5 ppm, which needs further exploration in the future. In line with this, a mass of cell loss in the testis was observed in the mice exposed to 5 ppm Cd, but not 0.5 ppm, manifested by reduced MI, which represents the rate of germ cell loss during meiosis ( Costa et al., 2017 ). In our present study, the MI in the 5 ppm Cd group was approximately 2.065, indicating a nearly 50% cell loss in the testis, markedly lower than that exhibited by the control group (approximately 25%) ( Costa et al., 2017 ;  Segatelli et al., 2004 ). Germ cells are the main cells in the testis, making up the bulk of the testis weight and are responsible for sperm production ( Habib et al., 2019 ). Thus, the additional loss of germ cells caused by exposure to 5 ppm Cd may significantly contribute to the reduction of testis weight and suppression of spermatogenesis.\n\nSince ferroptosis is characterized by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation ( Stockwell et al., 2017 ), we detected the following indicators related to these processes: total iron content, ferrous iron content, SOD2, MDA, 3-NT, and HO-1. Our results showed that total iron and ferrous iron level significantly increased in the 5 ppm group but not in 0.5 ppm group. We also observed enhanced MDA levels and a sharply increased expression of 3-NT in the 5 ppm group, indicating that the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and tyrosine nitration products may be a result of the iron accumulation caused by 5 ppm Cd exposure. Interestingly, exposure to 5 ppm Cd significantly reduced the expression of HO-1, which contradicts with previous studies ( Dong et al., 2020 ;  Li et al., 2020b ). This can be explained as HO-1 plays a dual role in ferroptosis. As an inducer of ferroptosis, HO-1 increases the sources of iron by degrading heme into biliverdin, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide. HO-1 is also an antioxidant that has been shown to protect against oxidative damage in various stress-related conditions ( Kajarabille and Latunde-Dada, 2019 ). With the increasing oxidative stress caused by Cd exposure, the synthesized HO-1 cannot handle the excessive reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species and is quickly exhausted. Therefore, HO-1 levels were markedly decreased in the 5 ppm Cd-treated mice. A similar trend was observed for the expression level of SOD2. These results indicate that the enhanced oxidative stress and decreased levels of antioxidants may be attributed to iron accumulation, which causes massive cell death in the testes. However, the mechanisms of iron accumulation in the testes caused by Cd exposure remains unknown.\n\nStudies have revealed that the large accumulation of ferrous iron is mainly derived from the destruction of iron homeostasis, which depends on iron metabolism processes ( Zhao et al., 2020 ;  Tang et al., 2018 ). As illustrated in  Figure 9 , under physiological conditions, circulating iron (ferric iron), which binds to transferrin, is taken up by cells through Tfrc ( Xie et al., 2016 ). In addition, extracellular iron can be partially imported into cells by ZIP8 and ZIP14, which are metal transporters belonging to the ZIP family ( Wang et al., 2012 ). Subsequently, ferric iron enters the endosome and is converted to ferrous iron by the metalloreductase STEAP3 and is further released by DMT1 into a labile iron pool located in the cytoplasm ( Lei et al., 2019 ). Finally, ferrous iron can be utilized for various physiological reactions or stored in FTH, whereas excess ferrous iron is exported out of the cells by the membrane protein FPN1 ( Xie et al., 2016 ;  Lei et al., 2019 ). Thus, any change in the iron metabolism pathways may affect the initiation of ferroptosis. In the present study, our results showed that Cd exposure either at the dose of 0.5 or 5 ppm did not cause any change in the expression of Tfrc, ZIP8, and ZIP14, suggesting that the import of iron into cells was not affected by Cd exposure. In contrast, the expression of FTH and FPN1 was markedly downregulated by exposure to 5 ppm Cd, suggesting that Cd-induced iron accumulation may be mainly caused by reduced storage and the exportation of iron. Interestingly, the expression of STEAP3 was significantly enhanced in the 5 ppm Cd group, indicating that the transport of iron was in an activated state during the requirement for intracellular ferrous iron. Nevertheless, previous studies have reported that several inducers or diseases cause ferroptosis through ferritinophagy mediated by NCOA4 ( Li et al., 2020a ;  Gryzik et al., 2021 ); however, our results showed no significant change in the expression of NCOA4 between experimental and control groups, indicating that Cd-induced accumulation of iron is not related to ferritinophagy. Taken together, these findings show that the Cd-induced disturbance of iron homeostasis was probably caused by the reduced exportation and storage of iron ( Fig. 9 ).\n\nFurthermore, given that ferroptosis can be regulated by lipid metabolism, GPX4, and SLC7A11 ( Fig. 9 ), we further detected the mRNA and protein expression levels of ACSL4, SLC7A11, and GPX4 in testis. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expressions of ACSL4 did not change significantly in the treated groups, which indicates that Cd-triggered ferroptosis may be independent of ACSL4 although we did not measure its activity. In addition, our results identified no significant change in both mRNA and protein expressions of GPX4 in the 0.5 and 5 ppm Cd groups, which is not consistent with the decreased expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and SOD2 in the present study. This inconsistence may be due to the fact that although GPX4 is one of Nrf2 downstream genes, Nrf2 is not the only one to regulate GPX4 expression. Several other transcriptional factors also regulate the expression of GPX4 such as zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), cAMP-response element modulator (CREM), and transcription factor AP-2c (TFAP2c) ( Han et al., 2021 ;  Wang et al., 2021 ;  Alim et al., 2019 ). Hence, Cd-triggered lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis may be independent of GPX4 activity. In the present study, we showed that the mRNA expression of SLC7A11 was reduced by about 25% with protein expression reduced by about 75% in mice treated with 5 ppm Cd. The significantly reduced protein level may result in significant reduction of SLC7A11 function, a pathway responsible for ferroptosis inhibition. It may need to notice that although GPX4 is the predominant pathway to inhibit phospholipid peroxidation and suppress ferroptosis, here the induction of ferroptosis by exposure to 5 ppm Cd seems not mainly due to the lose of its suppressive effect, which, however, is due to other GPX4-independent pathway as reported recently ( Kraft et al., 2020 ;  Bersuker et al., 2019 ;  Dar et al., 2021 ), needs to be further exposured in the future study. Considering the fact that ALOX12-mediated tumor suppression via P53-mediated ferroptosis, in which SLC7A11 is inhibited without GPX4 significant alteration ( Chu et al., 2019 ), we assume that the downregulation of SLC7A11 may partly contribute to the ferroptosis induced by Cd-mediated oxidative stress.\n\nThere are some limitations to our study. First, we lack the information of mitochondrial morphology and so the results were not included. Second, we didn’t conduct cell experiments treated with inhibitor of ferroptosis to further verify Cd-induced ferroptosis. Third, the specific pathway related to Cd-induced ferroptosis remains to illustrated.\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrated for the first time that ferroptosis may be a novel type of testicular cell death caused by Cd exposure. Cd-induced ferroptosis in the testes was mainly achieved by reducing the export and storage of iron and partially by inhibiting sSLC7A11 function. Our study provided new insights into the mechanism of Cd-induced testicular toxicity.",
