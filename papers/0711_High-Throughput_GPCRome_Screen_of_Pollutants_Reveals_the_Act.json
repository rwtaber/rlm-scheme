  "abstract": "Exposure to environmental pollutants is linked to numerous\ntoxic\noutcomes, warranting concern about the effect of pollutants on human\nhealth. To assess the threat of pollutant exposure, it is essential\nto understand their biological activity. Unfortunately, gaps remain\nfor many pollutants’ specific biological activity and molecular\ntargets. A superfamily of signaling proteins, G-protein-coupled receptors\n(GPCRs), has been shown as potential targets for pollutant activity.\nHowever, research investigating the pollutant activity at the GPCRome\nis scarce. This work explores pollutant activity across a library\nof human GPCRs by leveraging modern high-throughput screening techniques\ndevised for drug discovery and pharmacology. We designed and implemented\na pilot screen of eight pollutants at 314 human GPCRs and discovered\nspecific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) activity at sphingosine-1-phosphate\nand melatonin receptors. The method utilizes open-source resources\navailable to academic and governmental institutions to enable future\ncampaigns that screen large numbers of pollutants. Thus, we present\na novel high-throughput approach to assess the biological activity\nand specific targets of pollutants.",

      "text": "Many chemicals for industrial\nand consumer applications inevitably\npollute our food, water, and air.1 Understanding\nthe biological impact of human exposure to pollutants is necessary\nto gauge their threat to our health and inform regulatory decisions.\nA lack of proactive measures taken to identify and assess the toxicity\nof pollutants can result in considerable public health concerns—exemplified\nby historic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).2 While adverse health outcomes have been\nestablished for many pollutants,\ndetermining their specific targets and mechanisms remains challenging.\nFor example, the family of PCBs, legacy pollutants marked as hazardous\nand banned decades ago, is still subject to much research and new\nfindings.3−8 Moreover, the flow of new pollutants is relentless, leaving toxicologists\ninundated with compounds to investigate. Therefore, the ability to\nsimultaneously evaluate large numbers of pollutants for their potential\nimpact on biological systems is essential. Consequently, high-throughput\nscreening (HTS) techniques enabling rapid and broad assessment of\npollutant activity have become of great interest to toxicologists,\nas seen with the “Toxicology in the 21st Century” (Tox21)\nresearch consortium.9,10 In this work, we leverage G-protein-coupled\nreceptors (GPCRs) and contemporary HTS resources in a novel approach\nto assess pollutant activity. A superfamily containing hundreds\nof unique membrane receptors,\nGPCRs initiate signaling cascades for many physiological processes.\nMechanisms of GPCR activation by ligands and the subsequent activation\nof distinct signaling pathways are reviewed in detail elsewhere.11,12 Briefly, GPCRs respond to changes in the extracellular environment\nby recognizing myriad ligands from macromolecules to ions,13 initiating cellular responses, and ultimately\nimpacting systems from the cellular to the organismal level. The cellular\nresponses initiated by ligand–GPCR binding are predominantly\ntransduced via the activation of distinct G-protein members. Once\nactive, G-proteins interact with various downstream effector proteins\nthat modulate signaling molecules (e.g., second messengers such as\ncAMP and Ca2+) and, ultimately, the cellular response.11 Canonically, to terminate receptor signaling,\nactivated GPCRs are phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs), followed\nby the recruitment of β-arrestin proteins. Generally, the recruitment\nof β-arrestin to an activated GPCR is considered an off-switch.\nHowever, mechanisms exist where β-arrestin functions in nontraditional\nsignaling pathways.14−16 Given the manifold role GPCRs play in maintaining\nphysiological\nequilibria and the broad disruption of these equilibria by pollutants,\nit is reasonable to predict that pollutant–GPCR interactions\nexist and contribute to the adverse outcomes associated with pollutant\nexposure. Intuitively, reports in the literature have implicated GPCRs\nand GPCR signaling events as targets of pollutant toxicity.17−19 However, few studies exist that directly examine pollutant–GPCR\ninteractions. These studies are of limited scope, investigating select\npollutants and receptors in detail, which leaves a vast majority of\nthe GPCR landscape unexplored. We hypothesize that significant relationships\nbetween established pollutants and GPCRs remain to be discovered and\nthat a broad-ranging approach will show novel pollutant–GPCR\nactivity. The paucity of research focused on the activity of\npollutants at\nGPCRs (collectively, the GPCRome) is unsurprising due to a lack of\nresources and tools, which makes holistic studies difficult, time-consuming,\nand costly. Two modern techniques and tools that lower this barrier\nare the resources PRESTO-Tango20 and TRUPATH.21 An illustration and detailed description of\nthe resources are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Briefly, PRESTO-Tango utilizes the TANGO (transcriptional\noutput following arrestin translocation) system, where the recruitment\nof β-arrestin to the GPCR of interest causes the expression\nof luciferase, a light-producing enzyme.22 TRUPATH utilizes G-protein subunits labeled for bioluminescence\nresonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments to examine the activation\nof specific G-proteins. In combination, these resources enable the\nrapid and efficient screening of a GPCR library containing 314 unique\nreceptor members and the subsequent investigation into the downstream\nsignaling events of individual receptors. Further adding to their\nutility, both resources are open source (available to academic and\nnonprofit institutions), modular in design, and amenable to HTS. While\nPRESTO-Tango and TRUPATH are intended for drug discovery and detailed\npharmacology, in this work, we show for the first time that they also\nhave potential as tools for high-throughput toxicological investigations."

For TANGO plasmids used in the primary screen, bacterial stabs\nwere directly transferred to Luria Broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL\nof ampicillin and prepared via QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN,\n#27104) before evaluating the concentration and purity by measuring\nOD260/280 (Synergy2, BioTek.). To prepare library plates\nfor the primary screen, plasmids were diluted to 30 ng/μL in\n10 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and aliquoted to their respective wells in\n384-well polypropylene plates (ThermoFisher, #264573). All plasmids\nused in the subsequent dose–response and validation assays\nwere prepared similarly with Wizard Plus Midiprep (Promega, Madison,\nWI). The identity of the receptor plasmids considered hits was confirmed\nvia Sanger sequencing (University of Iowa, Genomics Core). HEK293T\ncells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were maintained in complete media comprised\nof Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s media (DMEM) supplemented\nwith 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and +1% penicillin–streptomycin.\nHTLA cells, a gift from the Barnea laboratory, were maintained similarly\nbut with the addition of 100 μg/mL of hygromycin B and 10 μg/mL\nof puromycin. Several batches of frozen cells were used throughout\nexperiments, with no more than a 10-passage difference in their starting\nnumber. Once thawed, cells were used within 3–20 passages. In\nthe primary screen, TANGO assays were conducted using a “batch\ntransfection” to facilitate high throughput. On day 1, cells\nwere detached via trypsin–EDTA solution, resuspended in complete\ngrowth media, and seeded at 10,000 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated\n384-well cell culture plates (Millipore Sigma-Aldrich, #Z759279) at\na final volume of 35 uL. On day 2, GPCR-Tango DNA library plates and\nTransit-2020 (Mirus Bio) were used to form a batch transfection plate.\nTransfection complexes were prepared in a 384-well polypropylene plate\n(Thermo Scientific, #264573) at a final concentration of 10 ng/μL\nof DNA, with a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 3 μL of transfection\nreagent. Transfection complexes were incubated for 20 min before transferring\n3 μL to cell plates using the liquid handling station (Microlab\nStar, Hamilton), resulting in test plates transfected with 96 receptors\nin quadruplicate. On day 3, to reduce the potential impact of serum\ncomponents on receptor activity, media was removed and replaced with\n30 μL of complete growth media diluted 1:10 in Opti-MEM (Thermo\nScientific #31985070). On day 4, 10 μL of 20 μM test compound\n(5 μM final) and vehicle control were added to test plates,\nboth in duplicate for each receptor. On day 5, 30 μL of cell\nsupernatant was carefully removed before the addition of 30 μL\nof Steady-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega) diluted 1:10 in cell culture\nmedia. After 30 min of incubation with Steady-Glo, relative light\nunits (RLUs) were measured (Synergy2, Biotek). Pollutant–receptor\npair follow-up experiments for the pollutant–receptor hit confirmation\nwere conducted identically to the primary screen. The method for determining\nand validating pollutant–GPCR pairs as hits is described in\nthe Supporting Information. All subsequent\nTANGO assays were conducted similarly except transfection complexes\nwere added to wells using the Mantis liquid handling platform (Formulatrix).\nIn experiments that include antagonists, media was supplemented with\nthe indicated antagonist or control for ∼60 min before compound\naddition. RLU values are shown as % change relative to the vehicle\ncontrols (i.e., basal activity) of individual experiments to correct\nfor variability between experiments. Gαβγ\ndissociation assays were performed as described by the original authors\nwith minimal modifications.23 Briefly,\nHEK293T were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected 4–8 h\nafter reaching ∼80% confluence with plasmid constituents (i.e., GPCRX, GαX-RLuc8, GFP2-GγX, and GβX)\nat a total amount of 250 ng of DNA. All plasmids were kept at an equal\n1:1:1:1 ratio, and transfection complexes were formed identically\nto the primary screen. Twenty-four h post transfection, cells were\nwashed, detached using a Versene–EDTA solution (Gibco, Cat\nno. 15040066), spun down (450g × 2 min), resuspended\nin complete media diluted 1:10 in Opti-MEM, and 35 μL of 650\ncells/μL (∼23,000 cells) were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 384-well plates. The following day, using the Microlab\nStar (Hamilton), media was aspirated from wells and replaced with\n15 μL of the test compound in drug buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.5\nmg/mL BSA, PH 7.5) or no compound control. Vehicle and reference ligand\ncontrols were distributed across rows to account for any possible\ndrift or edge effects. Following the addition of compound or vehicle,\n5 μL of 30 μM Prolume Purple (NanoLight Technologies Cat\nno. 369) dissolved in drug buffer was added to cells (7.5 μM\nfinal). Plates were equilibrated in the plate reader (Biotek, synergy2)\nfor ∼30 min before measuring luminescence with the emission\nfilters 440± 30 and 516 ± 20 nm for Rluc8 and GFP signal,\nrespectively. BRET ratios were determined by taking the ratio of RLUs\n(relative light units) from GFP2 to RLUs from the Rluc8. BRET ratios\nof vehicle controls are subtracted from the tested conditions to determine\nthe net change in the ratios (ΔBRET). To represent activation\nas an increase in the BRET signal relative to the vehicle, all ΔBRET\nvalues are represented as their negative value. In experiments where\ndata are normalized as % response, ΔBRET values of the vehicle\ncontrols are set to 0%, and ΔBRET values of the reference ligand\nare set to 100%. All ΔBRET and % response values were determined\nfrom individual experiments using their respective control groups. All calculations of\nstatistical significance were accomplished using GraphPad Prism 10. P values for the primary screen and the repeated hit confirmation\nexperiments were determined via multiple unpaired Student’s t tests, with no corrections for comparisons. For comparisons\nof PCB congener activity at sphingosine and melatonin receptors, data\nwere compared to vehicle control using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s\npost-test for multiple comparisons. For experiments of PCB congeners\nwith the panel of Gα proteins, compound groups were compared\nto Gα proteins via unpaired t test Holm–Sidak\npost-test for multiple comparisons.

      "text": "The\nPRESTO-Tango platform consists of 314 nonolfactory GPCRX-TANGO plasmids (i.e., the druggable-GPCRome), including well-characterized\nreceptors and poorly understood orphan receptors.20 Within the library, the activity of individual receptors\nis diverse and contextually dependent. Basal activity and the magnitude\nof activation of GPCRs contained in the library can span orders of\nmagnitude depending on the receptor(s) in question—a fundamental\ncharacteristic of GPCR biology.20,27 Even for the same receptor,\nactivation levels and signal windows exhibited can vary depending\non the ligand. In short, each GPCR must be considered its own system,\nand comparing the magnitudes of activation by a ligand across the\nentire GPCRome library is inappropriate. In our application,\nwe account for the inherent variability by discerning pollutant–receptor\npairs based on their statistical significance (i.e., P value) relative to the control population rather than their difference\nin magnitude. This approach values individual ligand–receptor\npairs across the entire library with respect to only the receptor\nin question and has little bias to the magnitude of change. Additionally,\nwhen ranking ligand–receptor pairs, P values\nare compared only with those of the same test compound, which would\nhelp to control for any nonspecific impact (e.g., vehicle differences,\ncompound cytotoxicity, etc.). Ultimately, we chose this analysis method\nto (1) help correct inter- and intrareceptor variabilities and (2)\nenable the detection of ligand–receptor interactions, which\nmay only show a small but consistent response in activity. To validate\nour method, the selective D2-like dopamine receptor agonist (−)-quinpirole28 was screened at the GPCRome library as a control\ncompound. Treatment with 100 nM (−)-quinpirole identified the\nfamily of D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) as ligand–receptor pairs for hit confirmation, while the\nD1-like dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD5) were unaffected\nby the ligand (Figure 1A). The D2-like receptors were confirmed as hits in follow-up validation\nexperiments (Figure 1B). The results from this control experiment validate our approach\nand statistical method for identifying specific ligand–receptor\ninteractions among the 314 unique GPCRs. Validation of screening\ndesign using (−)-quinpirole. (A)\nResults of GPCR library screen from treatment with 100 nM (−)-quinpirole.\nThe three D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) were marked\nabove the set threshold (mean +3 SD). (B) Volcano plot of repeated\nhit confirmation experiments for marked receptors (n = 3, triplicate). Data are shown as difference from vehicle (% change)\non the X-axis and statistical significance on the Y-axis (−log (P value)).\nIn the repeated confirmation experiments, ligand–receptor pairs\nwith P <. 01 (i.e., −log(P value) > 2) are considered hits. To test the ability\nof the GPCRome screen to discover pollutant–receptor pairs,\neight environmental pollutants were interrogated in the GPCR library.\nThe pollutants evaluated were three polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)\ncongeners (PCB11, PCB95, and PCB52), three PCB metabolites (4-OH-PCB11,\n4-OH-PCB52, and PCB52-SO4), bisphenol F (BPF), and lindane. Pollutants\nwere chosen based on established interest in their mechanisms of toxicity\nand their structural similarities (Figure 2) Structures and names of environmental pollutants\nscreened in the\nGPCR library. Briefly, PCBs are recognized to cause diverse health\noutcomes,\nmainly including neurotoxicity and neurodevelopment disorders,29 immune dysfunction,30 endocrine disruption,31 and reproductive\ntoxicity.32 The PCBs chosen in this study\ninclude prominent legacy PCBs (PCB52 and PCB95), nonlegacy PCBs of\nemerging concern (PCB11), and relevant metabolites, all with particular\ninterest for their implications in neurotoxicity and neurodevelopment\ndisorders.8,29,33 Bisphenols\nare a class of pollutants characterized by their endocrine-disrupting\nfunction, best illustrated by the notorious member, bisphenol A (BPA).34 BPF, a structural analog of BPA, is an emerging\nbisphenol pollutant with increasing evidence for broad toxicity ranging\nfrom metabolic35 to reproductive functions.36 Lindane is a pesticide with restricted or banned\nuse in most nations due to its established harm that ranges from neurotoxicity\nto cardiac arrhythmias.37 Collectively,\nthese pollutants evaluate the capability of our screening procedure\nto determine specific activity among structurally related pollutants\n(Figure 2) with meaningful\nimplications. Overnight treatment with 5 μM pollutants\nresulted in 49 ligand–receptor\npairs marked above the threshold for hit confirmation. The distribution\nof pollutant–receptor pairs for each compound and the list\nof pairs marked for hit confirmation can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2 and Table S1).\nFollow-up confirmation experiments identified five pollutant–receptor\npairs as hits (Figure 3A). Of these five ligand–receptor pairs marked as hits, three\nshowed appreciable concentration–response curves: PCB95 at\nsphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1PR4) and both\nPCB95 and PCB52 at melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B).\nConcentration–response experiments of the PCB congeners at\nS1PR4 and MTNR1B receptors showed a concentration-dependent increase\nin β-arrestin recruitment relative to the no compound control,\nwith activity in the low-micromolar range (Figure 3B). Furthermore, preincubation with S1PR4\nantagonist, CYM50358,38 and melatonin receptor\nantagonist, luzindole,39 blocked activity\nfrom PCBs specific to the receptor. Known ligands, melatonin (MT),\nsphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and fingolimod,40 were used parallel as positive controls to validate receptor\npharmacology. The remaining two pollutant–receptor pairs were\nconsidered false positives, as no evident activation was observed\nin concentration–response experiments (Figure S3), and their activity in the confirmation experiments\nwas incongruent with their activity from the primary screen. Hits identified\nfrom pollutant pilot screen (n = 3). (A) Volcano\nplot of pollutant–GPCR pairs investigated\n(5 μM) for hit confirmation. Pollutant–GPCR pairs with\na −log (P value) >2 (dotted line) are considered\nhits. (B) Concentration–response experiments of identified\ncontaminant–receptor pairs, dosed at receptors preincubated\nwith S1PR4 antagonist (2 μM, CYM50358), MTNR1B antagonist (500\nnM luzindole), or DMSO control. The number of validated hits from ligand–receptor\npairs\nmarked for confirmation (3 of 49) illustrates the nature of high-throughput\nmethodologies that often result in small proportions of initial hits\nbeing validated in subsequent experiments. In our iteration of the\nscreen, the threshold for hit confirmation was set as three standard\ndeviations above the mean log P value. While\na more stringent cutoff, for example, log P > 2.5, could result in fewer false positives, this would have\nalso\neliminated PCB52-MTNR1B, which was later validated\nas a hit. Furthermore, it was observed that several serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine;\n5-HT) receptors were clustered around the threshold for bisphenol\nF (BPF) but missed the cutoff by narrow margins (Figure S4). Briefly, BPF and structurally related bisphenol\ncompounds are implicated in various aspects of serotonin signaling.41,42 Consequently, the pollutant–receptor pairs of BPF and serotonin\nreceptors could represent false negatives. Thus, a balance must be\nstruck between the possibility of a greater number of false positives\nvs too high stringency, which could result in false negatives. Humans express\nmultiple receptors, recognizing melatonin and sphingosine-1-phosphate\nas their primary endogenous ligands. Melatonin has two receptor subtypes,43MTNR1B and the melatonin receptor\n1A (MTNR1A), while sphingosine-1-phosphate has five\nreceptor isoforms44 (S1PR1–5). All members of the receptor families were included in the receptors\nscreened. However, only the receptor members S1PR4 and MTNR1B were\nidentified as targets for distinct PCBs demonstrating specific activity\nfor PCB congeners and receptor subtypes/isoforms. To affirm these\nfindings, PCB congeners were tested at S1PR4 and MTNR1B at three concentrations:\n10, 5, and 1 μM (Figure 4A,B). Concentration-dependent activity was observed for PCB95\nand PCB52 at both receptors. Additionally, the 4-OH-PCB52 metabolite\nhad significant activity at MTNR1B, with a similar\nmagnitude to that of the parent congener at 1 μM, and the 4-OH-PCB11\nmetabolite had a concentration-dependent trend in activation at S1PR4. No significant activity was detected for PCB52-SO4\nor PCB11 at either receptor. Next, we evaluated if PCB parent congeners\nshowed activity at the other melatonin and sphingosine receptor family\nmembers (Figure 4C,D).\nInterestingly, none of the PCB parent congeners tested (5 μM)\nat S1PR1,2,3,5 and MTNR1A had significant activation of the receptors. Activity\nof PCBs at sphingosine-1-phosphate and melatonin receptors\nis selective for PCB congeners and receptor family members. Treatment\nwith three concentrations of PCB congeners and metabolites at (A)\nsphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1PR4) and (B) melatonin receptor\n1b (MTNR1B). (C) 5 μm PCB parent congeners at sphingosine-1-phosphate\nreceptor isoforms 1,2,3, and 5 (S1PR1–5), and (D) melatonin\nreceptor 1a (MTNR1A). Values are shown as % change relative to vehicle\ncontrol, data presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3,\nquadruplicate). (*) Significantly different from vehicle control at p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test\nfor multiple comparisons. (MT = melatonin; S1P =\nsphingosine-1-phosphate). These findings indicate that the activity of PCB\ncongeners on sphingosine-1-phosphate\nand melatonin receptor families is specific to both the congener and\nthe receptor family members. Results show that activity is limited\nto the S1PR4 and MTNR1B receptors, with activity predominately attributed\nto PCB95 and PCB52 and, to a lesser extent, to the hydroxylated metabolites.\nThese results demonstrate the capability of our screening approach\nto discern specific pollutant–receptor pairs from compounds\nof related structure and biological targets of conserved function. Identifying activity from PCB95 and PCB52, at S1PR4 and MTNR1B,\nbut not PCB11, suggests that structural differences contribute to\nthe specific activity of PCB congeners. While similar in chemical\ncomposition, PCB congeners can be classified by the orientation of\ntheir phenyl rings. PCBs can also be described as dioxin-like (DL)\nor nondioxin-like (NDL). The structural differences between DL and\nNDL-PCBs are known to contribute to divergent biological activity\nand toxicity.45 DL-PCBs are well-known\nto activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and this action is\nconsidered a primary mechanism for their adverse outcomes. The biological\nactivity of NDL-PCBs is less characterized, having more diverse putative\ntargets, such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the\npregnane-xenobiotic receptor (PXR).46 PCB95\nand PCB52 have chlorines at the ortho positions of the ring junctions\nthat constrain the biphenyl rings in a more rigid, noncoplanar orientation,47 while PCB11 lacks ortho-substituted chlorines.\nWe postulate that the more prominent activity of PCB95 and PCB52 could\nbe due to these ortho-substituted chlorines and their NDL structure.\nFuture investigations that examine differently substituted PCB congeners\nat S1PR4 and MTNR1B could provide valuable insight into the structural\nactivity relationships. Canonically,\nactivated GPCRs transduce their signal via the dissociation of Gαβγ\nheterotrimer complexes, where the dissociated (i.e., active) Gα\nand Gβγ subunits act on downstream effector proteins to\nproduce a cellular response.11 Several\nfamilies of Gα subunits contain over a dozen distinct members\nthat GPCRs can activate, dictated by the receptor’s structure\nand the conformational change specific to ligand binding.12 The TANGO assay measures the end point at the\nreceptor level via β-arrestin recruitment, which can be independent\nof G-protein activation. While measuring activity at the receptor\nlevel enables a homogeneous output for receptors coupled to different\ncellular pathways, it cannot describe what downstream signaling pathways\nare activated. Thus, additional systems are needed to confirm pollutant\nactivity at receptors beyond β-arrestin recruitment. To\nvalidate the interactions identified from the primary screen in an\northogonal assay and gain insight into potential activation mechanisms,\nwe examined parent PCB congeners at S1PR4 and MTNR1B to trigger specific\nG-protein α (Gα) subunit dissociation. Using the BRET\nassays (i.e., TRUPATH), PCB activity at S1PR4 and MTNR1B was tested\nwith the Gαi/o and Gα12/13 families,\nas these are the primary reported signal transducers for melatonin48 and S1P49 receptors\n(Figure 5). PCB activity\n(10 μM) on the dissociation of Gαi/o and Gα12/13 protein subunits at S1PR4\nand MTNR1B. Values are shown as the net change in the BRET ratio from\nthe vehicle control (ΔBRET ratio). Data represent mean ±\nSEM (n = 4, duplicate). (*) Significantly different\nfrom vehicle control at p < 0.001; unpaired t test Holm–Sidak post-test for multiple comparisons\n(MT = melatonin; S1P = sphingosine-1-phosphate). Congruent with the prior experiments, PCB95 and\nPCB52 (10 μM)\nhad significant activity for G-protein subunit activation at both\nreceptors, while PCB11 had no significant activity at either receptor.\nControl experiments using the dopamine D2 receptor (Figure S5) show that the change is not a product of nonspecific\nevents (e.g., compound interference with the BRET signal). These results\northogonally validate the findings from the β-arrestin experiments\nand further establish PCB activity at S1PR4 and MTNR1B. Interestingly, selective\ntrends in the activation of Gα proteins\nby PCBs were detected from the BRET experiments. Notably, at S1PR4,\nPCB52 and PCB95 show only activation of Gα12, while\nthe native ligand S1P activates both Gα12 and Gα13 subunits. Furthermore, when melatonin was used as a reference\nfor maximum activation, the relative activation from PCB95 and PCB52\nwas higher at MTNR1B-Gαi2 compared to that at MTNR1B-Gαi1/3. These results suggest that PCB congeners contain biased\nactivity at the receptors and signal through distinct pathways. Concentration–response\nexperiments were conducted for PCB95 and PCB52 at S1PR4-Gα12/13 and MTNR1B-Gαi2/3 to examine these relationships\nfurther. Affirming the initial observations, at S1PR4, PCB congeners\nexhibit\nactivation solely for Gα12, while S1P activates both\nGα12 and Gα13, and at MTNR1B, PCBs\nhave a more pronounced response in activity for the Gαi2 subunit compared to that of Gαi3 (Figure 6). Additionally, these experiments\nshow that PCB95 elicits a more robust response than PCB52, primarily\nat S1PR4. To confirm that the observed activity is receptor-mediated,\nwe tested the ability of antagonists to block G-protein activation.\nUsing PCB95 as a model system, cells were treated with PCB95 (10 and\n1 μM) in the presence or absence of selective antagonists CYM50358\n(2 μM) and 4P-PDOT50 (20 nM) at S1PR4-Gα12 and MTNR1B- Gαι2, respectively.

(*) Significantly different\nfrom vehicle control at p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA\nwith Dunnett’s post-test for multiple comparisons (MT = melatonin;\nS1P = sphingosine-1-phosphate). Together, results from the G-protein dissociation\nassays identify\nthe PCBs as specific agonists for S1PR4 and MTNR1B. In this system,\nthe activity of PCBs occurs after a brief exposure time (<30 min)\nand shows activity at low- and submicromolar concentrations. Additionally,\nresults demonstrate that the activity is selective for PCB congeners\nand is biased toward specific signaling pathways. Future studies examining\nthe relationships between PCBs and activated pathways in detail could\nprovide new insight into contributing mechanisms and biological implications\nof PCB exposure. For example, altered g-protein signaling at MTNR1B\nhas been correlated to metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes,51 and the cellular responses specific to Gα12 or Gα13 are vast.52,53 To the best of our knowledge, no studies have established\nPCB congeners\nas ligands for S1P or melatonin receptors, and we consider our findings\nnovel. However, we believe that there is precedent literature that\nconnects PCB activity to biological pathways proximal to the receptors\nand supports the significance of our findings. As a broad example,\none set of studies shows that treatment with melatonin can protect\nagainst PCB-induced neurotoxicity.54−59 The protective role of melatonin in these studies is largely attributed\nto its antioxidant characteristics and its downstream action on gene\nexpression.60 More specific examples are\nillustrated in select reports that establish PCB activity in cellular\nprocesses of circadian rhythm and sphingosine metabolism. These studies\nshow that PCB exposure can alter essential genes regulating circadian\nrhythm61,62 and the metabolic pathway responsible for\nproducing the S1P ligand.63,64 Interestingly, the\nstudies link their findings to similar outcomes regarding PCB toxicity,\nnotably the dysregulation of endothelial cell junctions from PCB exposure.62,64 The interrelationship of these activities is further supported by\nemerging reports that demonstrate crosstalk between melatonin and\nS1P signaling pathways, with implications at the receptor level.65,66 Collectively, these independent studies suggest that the activities\nfrom PCB95 and PCB52 at MTNR1B and S1PR4 reported here could be essential\ncomponents in a broader mechanism underlying PCB toxicity. Future\ninvestigations into the biological activity of PCBs that consider\nthe melatonin and sphingosine receptors could lead to more impactful\ndiscoveries. Here, we demonstrate a novel HTS paradigm for assessing\nthe activity\nof environmental pollutants.

The value of this approach\nis highlighted in our pilot screen, where the previously unknown activity\nbetween specific PCB congeners and GPCRs was identified.

Basal activity and the magnitude\nof activation of GPCRs contained in the library can span orders of\nmagnitude depending on the receptor(s) in question—a fundamental\ncharacteristic of GPCR biology.20,27 Even for the same receptor,\nactivation levels and signal windows exhibited can vary depending\non the ligand. In short, each GPCR must be considered its own system,\nand comparing the magnitudes of activation by a ligand across the\nentire GPCRome library is inappropriate. In our application,\nwe account for the inherent variability by discerning pollutant–receptor\npairs based on their statistical significance (i.e., P value) relative to the control population rather than their difference\nin magnitude. This approach values individual ligand–receptor\npairs across the entire library with respect to only the receptor\nin question and has little bias to the magnitude of change. Additionally,\nwhen ranking ligand–receptor pairs, P values\nare compared only with those of the same test compound, which would\nhelp to control for any nonspecific impact (e.g., vehicle differences,\ncompound cytotoxicity, etc.). Ultimately, we chose this analysis method\nto (1) help correct inter- and intrareceptor variabilities and (2)\nenable the detection of ligand–receptor interactions, which\nmay only show a small but consistent response in activity. To validate\nour method, the selective D2-like dopamine receptor agonist (−)-quinpirole28 was screened at the GPCRome library as a control\ncompound.

      "text": "To test the ability\nof the GPCRome screen to discover pollutant–receptor pairs,\neight environmental pollutants were interrogated in the GPCR library.\nThe pollutants evaluated were three polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)\ncongeners (PCB11, PCB95, and PCB52), three PCB metabolites (4-OH-PCB11,\n4-OH-PCB52, and PCB52-SO4), bisphenol F (BPF), and lindane. Pollutants\nwere chosen based on established interest in their mechanisms of toxicity\nand their structural similarities (Figure 2) Structures and names of environmental pollutants\nscreened in the\nGPCR library. Briefly, PCBs are recognized to cause diverse health\noutcomes,\nmainly including neurotoxicity and neurodevelopment disorders,29 immune dysfunction,30 endocrine disruption,31 and reproductive\ntoxicity.32 The PCBs chosen in this study\ninclude prominent legacy PCBs (PCB52 and PCB95), nonlegacy PCBs of\nemerging concern (PCB11), and relevant metabolites, all with particular\ninterest for their implications in neurotoxicity and neurodevelopment\ndisorders.8,29,33 Bisphenols\nare a class of pollutants characterized by their endocrine-disrupting\nfunction, best illustrated by the notorious member, bisphenol A (BPA).34 BPF, a structural analog of BPA, is an emerging\nbisphenol pollutant with increasing evidence for broad toxicity ranging\nfrom metabolic35 to reproductive functions.36 Lindane is a pesticide with restricted or banned\nuse in most nations due to its established harm that ranges from neurotoxicity\nto cardiac arrhythmias.37 Collectively,\nthese pollutants evaluate the capability of our screening procedure\nto determine specific activity among structurally related pollutants\n(Figure 2) with meaningful\nimplications. Overnight treatment with 5 μM pollutants\nresulted in 49 ligand–receptor\npairs marked above the threshold for hit confirmation. The distribution\nof pollutant–receptor pairs for each compound and the list\nof pairs marked for hit confirmation can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2 and Table S1).\nFollow-up confirmation experiments identified five pollutant–receptor\npairs as hits (Figure 3A). Of these five ligand–receptor pairs marked as hits, three\nshowed appreciable concentration–response curves: PCB95 at\nsphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1PR4) and both\nPCB95 and PCB52 at melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B).\nConcentration–response experiments of the PCB congeners at\nS1PR4 and MTNR1B receptors showed a concentration-dependent increase\nin β-arrestin recruitment relative to the no compound control,\nwith activity in the low-micromolar range (Figure 3B). Furthermore, preincubation with S1PR4\nantagonist, CYM50358,38 and melatonin receptor\nantagonist, luzindole,39 blocked activity\nfrom PCBs specific to the receptor. Known ligands, melatonin (MT),\nsphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and fingolimod,40 were used parallel as positive controls to validate receptor\npharmacology. The remaining two pollutant–receptor pairs were\nconsidered false positives, as no evident activation was observed\nin concentration–response experiments (Figure S3), and their activity in the confirmation experiments\nwas incongruent with their activity from the primary screen. Hits identified\nfrom pollutant pilot screen (n = 3). (A) Volcano\nplot of pollutant–GPCR pairs investigated\n(5 μM) for hit confirmation. Pollutant–GPCR pairs with\na −log (P value) >2 (dotted line) are considered\nhits. (B) Concentration–response experiments of identified\ncontaminant–receptor pairs, dosed at receptors preincubated\nwith S1PR4 antagonist (2 μM, CYM50358), MTNR1B antagonist (500\nnM luzindole), or DMSO control. The number of validated hits from ligand–receptor\npairs\nmarked for confirmation (3 of 49) illustrates the nature of high-throughput\nmethodologies that often result in small proportions of initial hits\nbeing validated in subsequent experiments. In our iteration of the\nscreen, the threshold for hit confirmation was set as three standard\ndeviations above the mean log P value. While\na more stringent cutoff, for example, log P > 2.5, could result in fewer false positives, this would have\nalso\neliminated PCB52-MTNR1B, which was later validated\nas a hit. Furthermore, it was observed that several serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine;\n5-HT) receptors were clustered around the threshold for bisphenol\nF (BPF) but missed the cutoff by narrow margins (Figure S4). Briefly, BPF and structurally related bisphenol\ncompounds are implicated in various aspects of serotonin signaling.41,42 Consequently, the pollutant–receptor pairs of BPF and serotonin\nreceptors could represent false negatives. Thus, a balance must be\nstruck between the possibility of a greater number of false positives\nvs too high stringency, which could result in false negatives."

Consequently, high-throughput\nscreening (HTS) techniques enabling rapid and broad assessment of\npollutant activity have become of great interest to toxicologists,\nas seen with the “Toxicology in the 21st Century” (Tox21)\nresearch consortium.9,10 In this work, we leverage G-protein-coupled\nreceptors (GPCRs) and contemporary HTS resources in a novel approach\nto assess pollutant activity. A superfamily containing hundreds\nof unique membrane receptors,\nGPCRs initiate signaling cascades for many physiological processes.\nMechanisms of GPCR activation by ligands and the subsequent activation\nof distinct signaling pathways are reviewed in detail elsewhere.11,12 Briefly, GPCRs respond to changes in the extracellular environment\nby recognizing myriad ligands from macromolecules to ions,13 initiating cellular responses, and ultimately\nimpacting systems from the cellular to the organismal level. The cellular\nresponses initiated by ligand–GPCR binding are predominantly\ntransduced via the activation of distinct G-protein members. Once\nactive, G-proteins interact with various downstream effector proteins\nthat modulate signaling molecules (e.g., second messengers such as\ncAMP and Ca2+) and, ultimately, the cellular response.11 Canonically, to terminate receptor signaling,\nactivated GPCRs are phosphorylated by GPCR kinases (GRKs), followed\nby the recruitment of β-arrestin proteins. Generally, the recruitment\nof β-arrestin to an activated GPCR is considered an off-switch.\nHowever, mechanisms exist where β-arrestin functions in nontraditional\nsignaling pathways.14−16 Given the manifold role GPCRs play in maintaining\nphysiological\nequilibria and the broad disruption of these equilibria by pollutants,\nit is reasonable to predict that pollutant–GPCR interactions\nexist and contribute to the adverse outcomes associated with pollutant\nexposure. Intuitively, reports in the literature have implicated GPCRs\nand GPCR signaling events as targets of pollutant toxicity.17−19 However, few studies exist that directly examine pollutant–GPCR\ninteractions. These studies are of limited scope, investigating select\npollutants and receptors in detail, which leaves a vast majority of\nthe GPCR landscape unexplored. We hypothesize that significant relationships\nbetween established pollutants and GPCRs remain to be discovered and\nthat a broad-ranging approach will show novel pollutant–GPCR\nactivity. The paucity of research focused on the activity of\npollutants at\nGPCRs (collectively, the GPCRome) is unsurprising due to a lack of\nresources and tools, which makes holistic studies difficult, time-consuming,\nand costly. Two modern techniques and tools that lower this barrier\nare the resources PRESTO-Tango20 and TRUPATH.21 An illustration and detailed description of\nthe resources are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Briefly, PRESTO-Tango utilizes the TANGO (transcriptional\noutput following arrestin translocation) system, where the recruitment\nof β-arrestin to the GPCR of interest causes the expression\nof luciferase, a light-producing enzyme.22 TRUPATH utilizes G-protein subunits labeled for bioluminescence\nresonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments to examine the activation\nof specific G-proteins. In combination, these resources enable the\nrapid and efficient screening of a GPCR library containing 314 unique\nreceptor members and the subsequent investigation into the downstream\nsignaling events of individual receptors. Further adding to their\nutility, both resources are open source (available to academic and\nnonprofit institutions), modular in design, and amenable to HTS. While\nPRESTO-Tango and TRUPATH are intended for drug discovery and detailed\npharmacology, in this work, we show for the first time that they also\nhave potential as tools for high-throughput toxicological investigations.\n\n## Materials and Methods\nGPCR-tango and Gα,β and γ plasmids were purchased\nas bacterial stocks from Addgene (PRESTO-Tango #1000000068, and TRUPATH\n#1000000163); MTNR1B and S1PR4 cDNA receptor plasmids used for the\nGαβγ dissociation assays were obtained from the\ncDNA Resource Center (www.cdna.org). For TANGO plasmids used in the primary screen, bacterial stabs\nwere directly transferred to Luria Broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL\nof ampicillin and prepared via QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN,\n#27104) before evaluating the concentration and purity by measuring\nOD260/280 (Synergy2, BioTek.). To prepare library plates\nfor the primary screen, plasmids were diluted to 30 ng/μL in\n10 mM tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and aliquoted to their respective wells in\n384-well polypropylene plates (ThermoFisher, #264573). All plasmids\nused in the subsequent dose–response and validation assays\nwere prepared similarly with Wizard Plus Midiprep (Promega, Madison,\nWI). The identity of the receptor plasmids considered hits was confirmed\nvia Sanger sequencing (University of Iowa, Genomics Core). HEK293T\ncells (ATCC, CRL-3216) were maintained in complete media comprised\nof Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s media (DMEM) supplemented\nwith 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and +1% penicillin–streptomycin.\nHTLA cells, a gift from the Barnea laboratory, were maintained similarly\nbut with the addition of 100 μg/mL of hygromycin B and 10 μg/mL\nof puromycin. Several batches of frozen cells were used throughout\nexperiments, with no more than a 10-passage difference in their starting\nnumber. Once thawed, cells were used within 3–20 passages. In\nthe primary screen, TANGO assays were conducted using a “batch\ntransfection” to facilitate high throughput. On day 1, cells\nwere detached via trypsin–EDTA solution, resuspended in complete\ngrowth media, and seeded at 10,000 cells/well in poly-d-lysine-coated\n384-well cell culture plates (Millipore Sigma-Aldrich, #Z759279) at\na final volume of 35 uL. On day 2, GPCR-Tango DNA library plates and\nTransit-2020 (Mirus Bio) were used to form a batch transfection plate.\nTransfection complexes were prepared in a 384-well polypropylene plate\n(Thermo Scientific, #264573) at a final concentration of 10 ng/μL\nof DNA, with a ratio of 1 μg of DNA to 3 μL of transfection\nreagent. Transfection complexes were incubated for 20 min before transferring\n3 μL to cell plates using the liquid handling station (Microlab\nStar, Hamilton), resulting in test plates transfected with 96 receptors\nin quadruplicate. On day 3, to reduce the potential impact of serum\ncomponents on receptor activity, media was removed and replaced with\n30 μL of complete growth media diluted 1:10 in Opti-MEM (Thermo\nScientific #31985070). On day 4, 10 μL of 20 μM test compound\n(5 μM final) and vehicle control were added to test plates,\nboth in duplicate for each receptor. On day 5, 30 μL of cell\nsupernatant was carefully removed before the addition of 30 μL\nof Steady-Glo luciferase reagent (Promega) diluted 1:10 in cell culture\nmedia. After 30 min of incubation with Steady-Glo, relative light\nunits (RLUs) were measured (Synergy2, Biotek). Pollutant–receptor\npair follow-up experiments for the pollutant–receptor hit confirmation\nwere conducted identically to the primary screen. The method for determining\nand validating pollutant–GPCR pairs as hits is described in\nthe Supporting Information. All subsequent\nTANGO assays were conducted similarly except transfection complexes\nwere added to wells using the Mantis liquid handling platform (Formulatrix).\nIn experiments that include antagonists, media was supplemented with\nthe indicated antagonist or control for ∼60 min before compound\naddition. RLU values are shown as % change relative to the vehicle\ncontrols (i.e., basal activity) of individual experiments to correct\nfor variability between experiments. Gαβγ\ndissociation assays were performed as described by the original authors\nwith minimal modifications.23 Briefly,\nHEK293T were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected 4–8 h\nafter reaching ∼80% confluence with plasmid constituents (i.e., GPCRX, GαX-RLuc8, GFP2-GγX, and GβX)\nat a total amount of 250 ng of DNA. All plasmids were kept at an equal\n1:1:1:1 ratio, and transfection complexes were formed identically\nto the primary screen. Twenty-four h post transfection, cells were\nwashed, detached using a Versene–EDTA solution (Gibco, Cat\nno. 15040066), spun down (450g × 2 min), resuspended\nin complete media diluted 1:10 in Opti-MEM, and 35 μL of 650\ncells/μL (∼23,000 cells) were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 384-well plates. The following day, using the Microlab\nStar (Hamilton), media was aspirated from wells and replaced with\n15 μL of the test compound in drug buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.5\nmg/mL BSA, PH 7.5) or no compound control. Vehicle and reference ligand\ncontrols were distributed across rows to account for any possible\ndrift or edge effects. Following the addition of compound or vehicle,\n5 μL of 30 μM Prolume Purple (NanoLight Technologies Cat\nno. 369) dissolved in drug buffer was added to cells (7.5 μM\nfinal). Plates were equilibrated in the plate reader (Biotek, synergy2)\nfor ∼30 min before measuring luminescence with the emission\nfilters 440± 30 and 516 ± 20 nm for Rluc8 and GFP signal,\nrespectively. BRET ratios were determined by taking the ratio of RLUs\n(relative light units) from GFP2 to RLUs from the Rluc8. BRET ratios\nof vehicle controls are subtracted from the tested conditions to determine\nthe net change in the ratios (ΔBRET). To represent activation\nas an increase in the BRET signal relative to the vehicle, all ΔBRET\nvalues are represented as their negative value. In experiments where\ndata are normalized as % response, ΔBRET values of the vehicle\ncontrols are set to 0%, and ΔBRET values of the reference ligand\nare set to 100%. All ΔBRET and % response values were determined\nfrom individual experiments using their respective control groups. All calculations of\nstatistical significance were accomplished using GraphPad Prism 10. P values for the primary screen and the repeated hit confirmation\nexperiments were determined via multiple unpaired Student’s t tests, with no corrections for comparisons. For comparisons\nof PCB congener activity at sphingosine and melatonin receptors, data\nwere compared to vehicle control using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s\npost-test for multiple comparisons. For experiments of PCB congeners\nwith the panel of Gα proteins, compound groups were compared\nto Gα proteins via unpaired t test Holm–Sidak\npost-test for multiple comparisons. Curves for concentration–response\nexperiments were fit using a 4-parameter logistic regression. In all\nexperiments, comparisons with P < 0.001 compared\nto vehicle control are marked with an asterisk. The Iowa Superfund Research\nProgram (ISRP) supplied the pollutants used in the pilot study. PCBs\nand metabolites were synthesized and authenticated by the ISRP Synthesis\nCore as previously described.24−26 A description of pharmacological\nagents and pollutants can be found in the Supporting Information. Chemical identifiers of pollutants are shown in\nthe Supporting Information (Table S1).\n\n## Preparation and Handling of DNA Plasmids\nGPCR-tango and Gα,β and γ plasmids were purchased\nas bacterial stocks from Addgene (PRESTO-Tango #1000000068, and TRUPATH\n#1000000163); MTNR1B and S1PR4 cDNA receptor plasmids used for the\nGαβγ dissociation assays were obtained from the\ncDNA Resource Center (www.cdna.org).

Chemical identifiers of pollutants are shown in\nthe Supporting Information (Table S1).\n\n## Results and Discussion\nThe\nPRESTO-Tango platform consists of 314 nonolfactory GPCRX-TANGO plasmids (i.e., the druggable-GPCRome), including well-characterized\nreceptors and poorly understood orphan receptors.20 Within the library, the activity of individual receptors\nis diverse and contextually dependent. Basal activity and the magnitude\nof activation of GPCRs contained in the library can span orders of\nmagnitude depending on the receptor(s) in question—a fundamental\ncharacteristic of GPCR biology.20,27 Even for the same receptor,\nactivation levels and signal windows exhibited can vary depending\non the ligand. In short, each GPCR must be considered its own system,\nand comparing the magnitudes of activation by a ligand across the\nentire GPCRome library is inappropriate. In our application,\nwe account for the inherent variability by discerning pollutant–receptor\npairs based on their statistical significance (i.e., P value) relative to the control population rather than their difference\nin magnitude. This approach values individual ligand–receptor\npairs across the entire library with respect to only the receptor\nin question and has little bias to the magnitude of change. Additionally,\nwhen ranking ligand–receptor pairs, P values\nare compared only with those of the same test compound, which would\nhelp to control for any nonspecific impact (e.g., vehicle differences,\ncompound cytotoxicity, etc.). Ultimately, we chose this analysis method\nto (1) help correct inter- and intrareceptor variabilities and (2)\nenable the detection of ligand–receptor interactions, which\nmay only show a small but consistent response in activity. To validate\nour method, the selective D2-like dopamine receptor agonist (−)-quinpirole28 was screened at the GPCRome library as a control\ncompound. Treatment with 100 nM (−)-quinpirole identified the\nfamily of D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) as ligand–receptor pairs for hit confirmation, while the\nD1-like dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD5) were unaffected\nby the ligand (Figure 1A). The D2-like receptors were confirmed as hits in follow-up validation\nexperiments (Figure 1B). The results from this control experiment validate our approach\nand statistical method for identifying specific ligand–receptor\ninteractions among the 314 unique GPCRs. Validation of screening\ndesign using (−)-quinpirole. (A)\nResults of GPCR library screen from treatment with 100 nM (−)-quinpirole.\nThe three D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) were marked\nabove the set threshold (mean +3 SD). (B) Volcano plot of repeated\nhit confirmation experiments for marked receptors (n = 3, triplicate). Data are shown as difference from vehicle (% change)\non the X-axis and statistical significance on the Y-axis (−log (P value)).\nIn the repeated confirmation experiments, ligand–receptor pairs\nwith P <. 01 (i.e., −log(P value) > 2) are considered hits. To test the ability\nof the GPCRome screen to discover pollutant–receptor pairs,\neight environmental pollutants were interrogated in the GPCR library.\nThe pollutants evaluated were three polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)\ncongeners (PCB11, PCB95, and PCB52), three PCB metabolites (4-OH-PCB11,\n4-OH-PCB52, and PCB52-SO4), bisphenol F (BPF), and lindane. Pollutants\nwere chosen based on established interest in their mechanisms of toxicity\nand their structural similarities (Figure 2) Structures and names of environmental pollutants\nscreened in the\nGPCR library. Briefly, PCBs are recognized to cause diverse health\noutcomes,\nmainly including neurotoxicity and neurodevelopment disorders,29 immune dysfunction,30 endocrine disruption,31 and reproductive\ntoxicity.32 The PCBs chosen in this study\ninclude prominent legacy PCBs (PCB52 and PCB95), nonlegacy PCBs of\nemerging concern (PCB11), and relevant metabolites, all with particular\ninterest for their implications in neurotoxicity and neurodevelopment\ndisorders.8,29,33 Bisphenols\nare a class of pollutants characterized by their endocrine-disrupting\nfunction, best illustrated by the notorious member, bisphenol A (BPA).34 BPF, a structural analog of BPA, is an emerging\nbisphenol pollutant with increasing evidence for broad toxicity ranging\nfrom metabolic35 to reproductive functions.36 Lindane is a pesticide with restricted or banned\nuse in most nations due to its established harm that ranges from neurotoxicity\nto cardiac arrhythmias.37 Collectively,\nthese pollutants evaluate the capability of our screening procedure\nto determine specific activity among structurally related pollutants\n(Figure 2) with meaningful\nimplications. Overnight treatment with 5 μM pollutants\nresulted in 49 ligand–receptor\npairs marked above the threshold for hit confirmation. The distribution\nof pollutant–receptor pairs for each compound and the list\nof pairs marked for hit confirmation can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2 and Table S1).\nFollow-up confirmation experiments identified five pollutant–receptor\npairs as hits (Figure 3A). Of these five ligand–receptor pairs marked as hits, three\nshowed appreciable concentration–response curves: PCB95 at\nsphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1PR4) and both\nPCB95 and PCB52 at melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B).\nConcentration–response experiments of the PCB congeners at\nS1PR4 and MTNR1B receptors showed a concentration-dependent increase\nin β-arrestin recruitment relative to the no compound control,\nwith activity in the low-micromolar range (Figure 3B). Furthermore, preincubation with S1PR4\nantagonist, CYM50358,38 and melatonin receptor\nantagonist, luzindole,39 blocked activity\nfrom PCBs specific to the receptor. Known ligands, melatonin (MT),\nsphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and fingolimod,40 were used parallel as positive controls to validate receptor\npharmacology. The remaining two pollutant–receptor pairs were\nconsidered false positives, as no evident activation was observed\nin concentration–response experiments (Figure S3), and their activity in the confirmation experiments\nwas incongruent with their activity from the primary screen. Hits identified\nfrom pollutant pilot screen (n = 3). (A) Volcano\nplot of pollutant–GPCR pairs investigated\n(5 μM) for hit confirmation. Pollutant–GPCR pairs with\na −log (P value) >2 (dotted line) are considered\nhits. (B) Concentration–response experiments of identified\ncontaminant–receptor pairs, dosed at receptors preincubated\nwith S1PR4 antagonist (2 μM, CYM50358), MTNR1B antagonist (500\nnM luzindole), or DMSO control. The number of validated hits from ligand–receptor\npairs\nmarked for confirmation (3 of 49) illustrates the nature of high-throughput\nmethodologies that often result in small proportions of initial hits\nbeing validated in subsequent experiments. In our iteration of the\nscreen, the threshold for hit confirmation was set as three standard\ndeviations above the mean log P value. While\na more stringent cutoff, for example, log P > 2.5, could result in fewer false positives, this would have\nalso\neliminated PCB52-MTNR1B, which was later validated\nas a hit. Furthermore, it was observed that several serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine;\n5-HT) receptors were clustered around the threshold for bisphenol\nF (BPF) but missed the cutoff by narrow margins (Figure S4). Briefly, BPF and structurally related bisphenol\ncompounds are implicated in various aspects of serotonin signaling.41,42 Consequently, the pollutant–receptor pairs of BPF and serotonin\nreceptors could represent false negatives. Thus, a balance must be\nstruck between the possibility of a greater number of false positives\nvs too high stringency, which could result in false negatives. Humans express\nmultiple receptors, recognizing melatonin and sphingosine-1-phosphate\nas their primary endogenous ligands. Melatonin has two receptor subtypes,43MTNR1B and the melatonin receptor\n1A (MTNR1A), while sphingosine-1-phosphate has five\nreceptor isoforms44 (S1PR1–5). All members of the receptor families were included in the receptors\nscreened. However, only the receptor members S1PR4 and MTNR1B were\nidentified as targets for distinct PCBs demonstrating specific activity\nfor PCB congeners and receptor subtypes/isoforms. To affirm these\nfindings, PCB congeners were tested at S1PR4 and MTNR1B at three concentrations:\n10, 5, and 1 μM (Figure 4A,B). Concentration-dependent activity was observed for PCB95\nand PCB52 at both receptors. Additionally, the 4-OH-PCB52 metabolite\nhad significant activity at MTNR1B, with a similar\nmagnitude to that of the parent congener at 1 μM, and the 4-OH-PCB11\nmetabolite had a concentration-dependent trend in activation at S1PR4. No significant activity was detected for PCB52-SO4\nor PCB11 at either receptor. Next, we evaluated if PCB parent congeners\nshowed activity at the other melatonin and sphingosine receptor family\nmembers (Figure 4C,D).\nInterestingly, none of the PCB parent congeners tested (5 μM)\nat S1PR1,2,3,5 and MTNR1A had significant activation of the receptors. Activity\nof PCBs at sphingosine-1-phosphate and melatonin receptors\nis selective for PCB congeners and receptor family members. Treatment\nwith three concentrations of PCB congeners and metabolites at (A)\nsphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1PR4) and (B) melatonin receptor\n1b (MTNR1B). (C) 5 μm PCB parent congeners at sphingosine-1-phosphate\nreceptor isoforms 1,2,3, and 5 (S1PR1–5), and (D) melatonin\nreceptor 1a (MTNR1A). Values are shown as % change relative to vehicle\ncontrol, data presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3,\nquadruplicate). (*) Significantly different from vehicle control at p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test\nfor multiple comparisons. (MT = melatonin; S1P =\nsphingosine-1-phosphate). These findings indicate that the activity of PCB\ncongeners on sphingosine-1-phosphate\nand melatonin receptor families is specific to both the congener and\nthe receptor family members. Results show that activity is limited\nto the S1PR4 and MTNR1B receptors, with activity predominately attributed\nto PCB95 and PCB52 and, to a lesser extent, to the hydroxylated metabolites.\nThese results demonstrate the capability of our screening approach\nto discern specific pollutant–receptor pairs from compounds\nof related structure and biological targets of conserved function. Identifying activity from PCB95 and PCB52, at S1PR4 and MTNR1B,\nbut not PCB11, suggests that structural differences contribute to\nthe specific activity of PCB congeners. While similar in chemical\ncomposition, PCB congeners can be classified by the orientation of\ntheir phenyl rings. PCBs can also be described as dioxin-like (DL)\nor nondioxin-like (NDL). The structural differences between DL and\nNDL-PCBs are known to contribute to divergent biological activity\nand toxicity.45 DL-PCBs are well-known\nto activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and this action is\nconsidered a primary mechanism for their adverse outcomes. The biological\nactivity of NDL-PCBs is less characterized, having more diverse putative\ntargets, such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the\npregnane-xenobiotic receptor (PXR).46 PCB95\nand PCB52 have chlorines at the ortho positions of the ring junctions\nthat constrain the biphenyl rings in a more rigid, noncoplanar orientation,47 while PCB11 lacks ortho-substituted chlorines.\nWe postulate that the more prominent activity of PCB95 and PCB52 could\nbe due to these ortho-substituted chlorines and their NDL structure.\nFuture investigations that examine differently substituted PCB congeners\nat S1PR4 and MTNR1B could provide valuable insight into the structural\nactivity relationships. Canonically,\nactivated GPCRs transduce their signal via the dissociation of Gαβγ\nheterotrimer complexes, where the dissociated (i.e., active) Gα\nand Gβγ subunits act on downstream effector proteins to\nproduce a cellular response.11 Several\nfamilies of Gα subunits contain over a dozen distinct members\nthat GPCRs can activate, dictated by the receptor’s structure\nand the conformational change specific to ligand binding.12 The TANGO assay measures the end point at the\nreceptor level via β-arrestin recruitment, which can be independent\nof G-protein activation. While measuring activity at the receptor\nlevel enables a homogeneous output for receptors coupled to different\ncellular pathways, it cannot describe what downstream signaling pathways\nare activated. Thus, additional systems are needed to confirm pollutant\nactivity at receptors beyond β-arrestin recruitment. To\nvalidate the interactions identified from the primary screen in an\northogonal assay and gain insight into potential activation mechanisms,\nwe examined parent PCB congeners at S1PR4 and MTNR1B to trigger specific\nG-protein α (Gα) subunit dissociation. Using the BRET\nassays (i.e., TRUPATH), PCB activity at S1PR4 and MTNR1B was tested\nwith the Gαi/o and Gα12/13 families,\nas these are the primary reported signal transducers for melatonin48 and S1P49 receptors\n(Figure 5).

Data represent mean ±\nSEM (n = 4, duplicate). (*) Significantly different\nfrom vehicle control at p < 0.001; unpaired t test Holm–Sidak post-test for multiple comparisons\n(MT = melatonin; S1P = sphingosine-1-phosphate). Congruent with the prior experiments, PCB95 and\nPCB52 (10 μM)\nhad significant activity for G-protein subunit activation at both\nreceptors, while PCB11 had no significant activity at either receptor.\nControl experiments using the dopamine D2 receptor (Figure S5) show that the change is not a product of nonspecific\nevents (e.g., compound interference with the BRET signal). These results\northogonally validate the findings from the β-arrestin experiments\nand further establish PCB activity at S1PR4 and MTNR1B. Interestingly, selective\ntrends in the activation of Gα proteins\nby PCBs were detected from the BRET experiments. Notably, at S1PR4,\nPCB52 and PCB95 show only activation of Gα12, while\nthe native ligand S1P activates both Gα12 and Gα13 subunits. Furthermore, when melatonin was used as a reference\nfor maximum activation, the relative activation from PCB95 and PCB52\nwas higher at MTNR1B-Gαi2 compared to that at MTNR1B-Gαi1/3. These results suggest that PCB congeners contain biased\nactivity at the receptors and signal through distinct pathways. Concentration–response\nexperiments were conducted for PCB95 and PCB52 at S1PR4-Gα12/13 and MTNR1B-Gαi2/3 to examine these relationships\nfurther. Affirming the initial observations, at S1PR4, PCB congeners\nexhibit\nactivation solely for Gα12, while S1P activates both\nGα12 and Gα13, and at MTNR1B, PCBs\nhave a more pronounced response in activity for the Gαi2 subunit compared to that of Gαi3 (Figure 6). Additionally, these experiments\nshow that PCB95 elicits a more robust response than PCB52, primarily\nat S1PR4. To confirm that the observed activity is receptor-mediated,\nwe tested the ability of antagonists to block G-protein activation.\nUsing PCB95 as a model system, cells were treated with PCB95 (10 and\n1 μM) in the presence or absence of selective antagonists CYM50358\n(2 μM) and 4P-PDOT50 (20 nM) at S1PR4-Gα12 and MTNR1B- Gαι2, respectively. At\neach receptor, the antagonists significantly blocked the dissociation\nof Gα proteins from PCB exposure (Figure 7).

Values are shown as % response, normalized to reference\nligand (10 μM sphingosine-1-phosphate, S1P; or 500 nM melatonin,\nMT) and vehicle control.

Cells were treated\nwith PCBs diluted\nin buffer containing S1PR4 antagonist (CYM5038), MTNR1B antagonist\n(20 nM 4P-PDOT), or no antagonist control. (*) Significantly different\nfrom vehicle control at p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA\nwith Dunnett’s post-test for multiple comparisons (MT = melatonin;\nS1P = sphingosine-1-phosphate). Together, results from the G-protein dissociation\nassays identify\nthe PCBs as specific agonists for S1PR4 and MTNR1B. In this system,\nthe activity of PCBs occurs after a brief exposure time (<30 min)\nand shows activity at low- and submicromolar concentrations. Additionally,\nresults demonstrate that the activity is selective for PCB congeners\nand is biased toward specific signaling pathways. Future studies examining\nthe relationships between PCBs and activated pathways in detail could\nprovide new insight into contributing mechanisms and biological implications\nof PCB exposure. For example, altered g-protein signaling at MTNR1B\nhas been correlated to metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes,51 and the cellular responses specific to Gα12 or Gα13 are vast.52,53 To the best of our knowledge, no studies have established\nPCB congeners\nas ligands for S1P or melatonin receptors, and we consider our findings\nnovel. However, we believe that there is precedent literature that\nconnects PCB activity to biological pathways proximal to the receptors\nand supports the significance of our findings. As a broad example,\none set of studies shows that treatment with melatonin can protect\nagainst PCB-induced neurotoxicity.54−59 The protective role of melatonin in these studies is largely attributed\nto its antioxidant characteristics and its downstream action on gene\nexpression.60 More specific examples are\nillustrated in select reports that establish PCB activity in cellular\nprocesses of circadian rhythm and sphingosine metabolism. These studies\nshow that PCB exposure can alter essential genes regulating circadian\nrhythm61,62 and the metabolic pathway responsible for\nproducing the S1P ligand.63,64 Interestingly, the\nstudies link their findings to similar outcomes regarding PCB toxicity,\nnotably the dysregulation of endothelial cell junctions from PCB exposure.62,64 The interrelationship of these activities is further supported by\nemerging reports that demonstrate crosstalk between melatonin and\nS1P signaling pathways, with implications at the receptor level.65,66 Collectively, these independent studies suggest that the activities\nfrom PCB95 and PCB52 at MTNR1B and S1PR4 reported here could be essential\ncomponents in a broader mechanism underlying PCB toxicity. Future\ninvestigations into the biological activity of PCBs that consider\nthe melatonin and sphingosine receptors could lead to more impactful\ndiscoveries. Here, we demonstrate a novel HTS paradigm for assessing\nthe activity\nof environmental pollutants. Advantageous for toxicological investigations,\nthis approach can facilitate the interrogation of large numbers of\npollutants at 314 diverse cellular targets. The value of this approach\nis highlighted in our pilot screen, where the previously unknown activity\nbetween specific PCB congeners and GPCRs was identified. Thus, this\nwork provides fresh resources for examining the biological impacts\nof various environmental pollutants and compounds of concern.\n\n## Validation of Primary Screen\nThe\nPRESTO-Tango platform consists of 314 nonolfactory GPCRX-TANGO plasmids (i.e., the druggable-GPCRome), including well-characterized\nreceptors and poorly understood orphan receptors.20 Within the library, the activity of individual receptors\nis diverse and contextually dependent. Basal activity and the magnitude\nof activation of GPCRs contained in the library can span orders of\nmagnitude depending on the receptor(s) in question—a fundamental\ncharacteristic of GPCR biology.20,27 Even for the same receptor,\nactivation levels and signal windows exhibited can vary depending\non the ligand. In short, each GPCR must be considered its own system,\nand comparing the magnitudes of activation by a ligand across the\nentire GPCRome library is inappropriate. In our application,\nwe account for the inherent variability by discerning pollutant–receptor\npairs based on their statistical significance (i.e., P value) relative to the control population rather than their difference\nin magnitude. This approach values individual ligand–receptor\npairs across the entire library with respect to only the receptor\nin question and has little bias to the magnitude of change. Additionally,\nwhen ranking ligand–receptor pairs, P values\nare compared only with those of the same test compound, which would\nhelp to control for any nonspecific impact (e.g., vehicle differences,\ncompound cytotoxicity, etc.). Ultimately, we chose this analysis method\nto (1) help correct inter- and intrareceptor variabilities and (2)\nenable the detection of ligand–receptor interactions, which\nmay only show a small but consistent response in activity. To validate\nour method, the selective D2-like dopamine receptor agonist (−)-quinpirole28 was screened at the GPCRome library as a control\ncompound. Treatment with 100 nM (−)-quinpirole identified the\nfamily of D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) as ligand–receptor pairs for hit confirmation, while the\nD1-like dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD5) were unaffected\nby the ligand (Figure 1A). The D2-like receptors were confirmed as hits in follow-up validation\nexperiments (Figure 1B). The results from this control experiment validate our approach\nand statistical method for identifying specific ligand–receptor\ninteractions among the 314 unique GPCRs. Validation of screening\ndesign using (−)-quinpirole. (A)\nResults of GPCR library screen from treatment with 100 nM (−)-quinpirole.\nThe three D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) were marked\nabove the set threshold (mean +3 SD). (B) Volcano plot of repeated\nhit confirmation experiments for marked receptors (n = 3, triplicate). Data are shown as difference from vehicle (% change)\non the X-axis and statistical significance on the Y-axis (−log (P value)).\nIn the repeated confirmation experiments, ligand–receptor pairs\nwith P <. 01 (i.e., −log(P value) > 2) are considered hits.\n\n## Identification of PCB Congeners as Ligands\nfor Melatonin and Sphingosine Receptors\nTo test the ability\nof the GPCRome screen to discover pollutant–receptor pairs,\neight environmental pollutants were interrogated in the GPCR library.\nThe pollutants evaluated were three polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)\ncongeners (PCB11, PCB95, and PCB52), three PCB metabolites (4-OH-PCB11,\n4-OH-PCB52, and PCB52-SO4), bisphenol F (BPF), and lindane. Pollutants\nwere chosen based on established interest in their mechanisms of toxicity\nand their structural similarities (Figure 2) Structures and names of environmental pollutants\nscreened in the\nGPCR library. Briefly, PCBs are recognized to cause diverse health\noutcomes,\nmainly including neurotoxicity and neurodevelopment disorders,29 immune dysfunction,30 endocrine disruption,31 and reproductive\ntoxicity.32 The PCBs chosen in this study\ninclude prominent legacy PCBs (PCB52 and PCB95), nonlegacy PCBs of\nemerging concern (PCB11), and relevant metabolites, all with particular\ninterest for their implications in neurotoxicity and neurodevelopment\ndisorders.8,29,33 Bisphenols\nare a class of pollutants characterized by their endocrine-disrupting\nfunction, best illustrated by the notorious member, bisphenol A (BPA).34 BPF, a structural analog of BPA, is an emerging\nbisphenol pollutant with increasing evidence for broad toxicity ranging\nfrom metabolic35 to reproductive functions.36 Lindane is a pesticide with restricted or banned\nuse in most nations due to its established harm that ranges from neurotoxicity\nto cardiac arrhythmias.37 Collectively,\nthese pollutants evaluate the capability of our screening procedure\nto determine specific activity among structurally related pollutants\n(Figure 2) with meaningful\nimplications. Overnight treatment with 5 μM pollutants\nresulted in 49 ligand–receptor\npairs marked above the threshold for hit confirmation. The distribution\nof pollutant–receptor pairs for each compound and the list\nof pairs marked for hit confirmation can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2 and Table S1).\nFollow-up confirmation experiments identified five pollutant–receptor\npairs as hits (Figure 3A). Of these five ligand–receptor pairs marked as hits, three\nshowed appreciable concentration–response curves: PCB95 at\nsphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1PR4) and both\nPCB95 and PCB52 at melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B).\nConcentration–response experiments of the PCB congeners at\nS1PR4 and MTNR1B receptors showed a concentration-dependent increase\nin β-arrestin recruitment relative to the no compound control,\nwith activity in the low-micromolar range (Figure 3B). Furthermore, preincubation with S1PR4\nantagonist, CYM50358,38 and melatonin receptor\nantagonist, luzindole,39 blocked activity\nfrom PCBs specific to the receptor. Known ligands, melatonin (MT),\nsphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and fingolimod,40 were used parallel as positive controls to validate receptor\npharmacology. The remaining two pollutant–receptor pairs were\nconsidered false positives, as no evident activation was observed\nin concentration–response experiments (Figure S3), and their activity in the confirmation experiments\nwas incongruent with their activity from the primary screen. Hits identified\nfrom pollutant pilot screen (n = 3). (A) Volcano\nplot of pollutant–GPCR pairs investigated\n(5 μM) for hit confirmation. Pollutant–GPCR pairs with\na −log (P value) >2 (dotted line) are considered\nhits. (B) Concentration–response experiments of identified\ncontaminant–receptor pairs, dosed at receptors preincubated\nwith S1PR4 antagonist (2 μM, CYM50358), MTNR1B antagonist (500\nnM luzindole), or DMSO control. The number of validated hits from ligand–receptor\npairs\nmarked for confirmation (3 of 49) illustrates the nature of high-throughput\nmethodologies that often result in small proportions of initial hits\nbeing validated in subsequent experiments. In our iteration of the\nscreen, the threshold for hit confirmation was set as three standard\ndeviations above the mean log P value. While\na more stringent cutoff, for example, log P > 2.5, could result in fewer false positives, this would have\nalso\neliminated PCB52-MTNR1B, which was later validated\nas a hit. Furthermore, it was observed that several serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine;\n5-HT) receptors were clustered around the threshold for bisphenol\nF (BPF) but missed the cutoff by narrow margins (Figure S4). Briefly, BPF and structurally related bisphenol\ncompounds are implicated in various aspects of serotonin signaling.41,42 Consequently, the pollutant–receptor pairs of BPF and serotonin\nreceptors could represent false negatives. Thus, a balance must be\nstruck between the possibility of a greater number of false positives\nvs too high stringency, which could result in false negatives.\n\n## PCB Activity at Melatonin and Sphingosine\nReceptors Is Specific to Congener and Receptor\nHumans express\nmultiple receptors, recognizing melatonin and sphingosine-1-phosphate\nas their primary endogenous ligands. Melatonin has two receptor subtypes,43MTNR1B and the melatonin receptor\n1A (MTNR1A), while sphingosine-1-phosphate has five\nreceptor isoforms44 (S1PR1–5). All members of the receptor families were included in the receptors\nscreened. However, only the receptor members S1PR4 and MTNR1B were\nidentified as targets for distinct PCBs demonstrating specific activity\nfor PCB congeners and receptor subtypes/isoforms. To affirm these\nfindings, PCB congeners were tested at S1PR4 and MTNR1B at three concentrations:\n10, 5, and 1 μM (Figure 4A,B). Concentration-dependent activity was observed for PCB95\nand PCB52 at both receptors. Additionally, the 4-OH-PCB52 metabolite\nhad significant activity at MTNR1B, with a similar\nmagnitude to that of the parent congener at 1 μM, and the 4-OH-PCB11\nmetabolite had a concentration-dependent trend in activation at S1PR4. No significant activity was detected for PCB52-SO4\nor PCB11 at either receptor. Next, we evaluated if PCB parent congeners\nshowed activity at the other melatonin and sphingosine receptor family\nmembers (Figure 4C,D).\nInterestingly, none of the PCB parent congeners tested (5 μM)\nat S1PR1,2,3,5 and MTNR1A had significant activation of the receptors. Activity\nof PCBs at sphingosine-1-phosphate and melatonin receptors\nis selective for PCB congeners and receptor family members. Treatment\nwith three concentrations of PCB congeners and metabolites at (A)\nsphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1PR4) and (B) melatonin receptor\n1b (MTNR1B). (C) 5 μm PCB parent congeners at sphingosine-1-phosphate\nreceptor isoforms 1,2,3, and 5 (S1PR1–5), and (D) melatonin\nreceptor 1a (MTNR1A). Values are shown as % change relative to vehicle\ncontrol, data presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3,\nquadruplicate). (*) Significantly different from vehicle control at p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test\nfor multiple comparisons. (MT = melatonin; S1P =\nsphingosine-1-phosphate). These findings indicate that the activity of PCB\ncongeners on sphingosine-1-phosphate\nand melatonin receptor families is specific to both the congener and\nthe receptor family members. Results show that activity is limited\nto the S1PR4 and MTNR1B receptors, with activity predominately attributed\nto PCB95 and PCB52 and, to a lesser extent, to the hydroxylated metabolites.\nThese results demonstrate the capability of our screening approach\nto discern specific pollutant–receptor pairs from compounds\nof related structure and biological targets of conserved function. Identifying activity from PCB95 and PCB52, at S1PR4 and MTNR1B,\nbut not PCB11, suggests that structural differences contribute to\nthe specific activity of PCB congeners. While similar in chemical\ncomposition, PCB congeners can be classified by the orientation of\ntheir phenyl rings. PCBs can also be described as dioxin-like (DL)\nor nondioxin-like (NDL). The structural differences between DL and\nNDL-PCBs are known to contribute to divergent biological activity\nand toxicity.45 DL-PCBs are well-known\nto activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and this action is\nconsidered a primary mechanism for their adverse outcomes. The biological\nactivity of NDL-PCBs is less characterized, having more diverse putative\ntargets, such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the\npregnane-xenobiotic receptor (PXR).46 PCB95\nand PCB52 have chlorines at the ortho positions of the ring junctions\nthat constrain the biphenyl rings in a more rigid, noncoplanar orientation,47 while PCB11 lacks ortho-substituted chlorines.\nWe postulate that the more prominent activity of PCB95 and PCB52 could\nbe due to these ortho-substituted chlorines and their NDL structure.\nFuture investigations that examine differently substituted PCB congeners\nat S1PR4 and MTNR1B could provide valuable insight into the structural\nactivity relationships.\n\n## Orthogonal Validation of PCB Activity at MTNR1B\nand S1PR4 with G-Protein Dissociation Assays\nCanonically,\nactivated GPCRs transduce their signal via the dissociation of Gαβγ\nheterotrimer complexes, where the dissociated (i.e., active) Gα\nand Gβγ subunits act on downstream effector proteins to\nproduce a cellular response.11 Several\nfamilies of Gα subunits contain over a dozen distinct members\nthat GPCRs can activate, dictated by the receptor’s structure\nand the conformational change specific to ligand binding.12 The TANGO assay measures the end point at the\nreceptor level via β-arrestin recruitment, which can be independent\nof G-protein activation. While measuring activity at the receptor\nlevel enables a homogeneous output for receptors coupled to different\ncellular pathways, it cannot describe what downstream signaling pathways\nare activated. Thus, additional systems are needed to confirm pollutant\nactivity at receptors beyond β-arrestin recruitment. To\nvalidate the interactions identified from the primary screen in an\northogonal assay and gain insight into potential activation mechanisms,\nwe examined parent PCB congeners at S1PR4 and MTNR1B to trigger specific\nG-protein α (Gα) subunit dissociation. Using the BRET\nassays (i.e., TRUPATH), PCB activity at S1PR4 and MTNR1B was tested\nwith the Gαi/o and Gα12/13 families,\nas these are the primary reported signal transducers for melatonin48 and S1P49 receptors\n(Figure 5). PCB activity\n(10 μM) on the dissociation of Gαi/o and Gα12/13 protein subunits at S1PR4\nand MTNR1B. Values are shown as the net change in the BRET ratio from\nthe vehicle control (ΔBRET ratio). Data represent mean ±\nSEM (n = 4, duplicate). (*) Significantly different\nfrom vehicle control at p < 0.001; unpaired t test Holm–Sidak post-test for multiple comparisons\n(MT = melatonin; S1P = sphingosine-1-phosphate). Congruent with the prior experiments, PCB95 and\nPCB52 (10 μM)\nhad significant activity for G-protein subunit activation at both\nreceptors, while PCB11 had no significant activity at either receptor.\nControl experiments using the dopamine D2 receptor (Figure S5) show that the change is not a product of nonspecific\nevents (e.g., compound interference with the BRET signal). These results\northogonally validate the findings from the β-arrestin experiments\nand further establish PCB activity at S1PR4 and MTNR1B. Interestingly, selective\ntrends in the activation of Gα proteins\nby PCBs were detected from the BRET experiments. Notably, at S1PR4,\nPCB52 and PCB95 show only activation of Gα12, while\nthe native ligand S1P activates both Gα12 and Gα13 subunits. Furthermore, when melatonin was used as a reference\nfor maximum activation, the relative activation from PCB95 and PCB52\nwas higher at MTNR1B-Gαi2 compared to that at MTNR1B-Gαi1/3. These results suggest that PCB congeners contain biased\nactivity at the receptors and signal through distinct pathways. Concentration–response\nexperiments were conducted for PCB95 and PCB52 at S1PR4-Gα12/13 and MTNR1B-Gαi2/3 to examine these relationships\nfurther. Affirming the initial observations, at S1PR4, PCB congeners\nexhibit\nactivation solely for Gα12, while S1P activates both\nGα12 and Gα13, and at MTNR1B, PCBs\nhave a more pronounced response in activity for the Gαi2 subunit compared to that of Gαi3 (Figure 6). Additionally, these experiments\nshow that PCB95 elicits a more robust response than PCB52, primarily\nat S1PR4. To confirm that the observed activity is receptor-mediated,\nwe tested the ability of antagonists to block G-protein activation.\nUsing PCB95 as a model system, cells were treated with PCB95 (10 and\n1 μM) in the presence or absence of selective antagonists CYM50358\n(2 μM) and 4P-PDOT50 (20 nM) at S1PR4-Gα12 and MTNR1B- Gαι2, respectively. At\neach receptor, the antagonists significantly blocked the dissociation\nof Gα proteins from PCB exposure (Figure 7).

(*) Significantly different\nfrom vehicle control at p < 0.001; one-way ANOVA\nwith Dunnett’s post-test for multiple comparisons (MT = melatonin;\nS1P = sphingosine-1-phosphate). Together, results from the G-protein dissociation\nassays identify\nthe PCBs as specific agonists for S1PR4 and MTNR1B. In this system,\nthe activity of PCBs occurs after a brief exposure time (<30 min)\nand shows activity at low- and submicromolar concentrations. Additionally,\nresults demonstrate that the activity is selective for PCB congeners\nand is biased toward specific signaling pathways.
