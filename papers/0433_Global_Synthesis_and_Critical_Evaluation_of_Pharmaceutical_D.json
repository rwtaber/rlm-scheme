We present\na global-scale analysis of the presence of 203 pharmaceuticals across\n41 countries and show that contamination is extensive due to widespread\nconsumption and subsequent disposal to rivers. There are clear regional\nbiases in current understanding with little work outside North America,\nEurope, and China, and no work within Africa.

This analysis highlights locations\nwhere concentrations of antibiotics, cardiovascular drugs, painkillers,\ncontrast media, and antiepileptic drugs have been recorded well above\nthresholds known to cause toxic effects in aquatic biota. Studies\nof pharmaceutical occurrence and effects need to be seen as a global\nresearch priority due to increasing consumption, particularly among\nsocieties with aging populations.

      "text": "Pharmaceuticals have been used by humans\nfor centuries with commercialization\nbeginning in the late 19th Century. Aside from pioneering studies\nin the 1970s and 1980s1−3 pharmaceuticals have only emerged as a major group\nof environmental contaminants over the last 15 years.4−7 Their presence in numerous environmental compartments including\nsurface and ground waters, soils, and biota is now well established8 and the predominant pathway of entry to the environment\nis considered to be postconsumption excretion to the sewer network\nand subsequent passage to rivers via straight piping, sewage treatment\nplants (STPs; where their removal is variable e.g., ref (9)) or sewer overflows.10−12 Pesticide research in the 1990s identified clofibric acid as a widespread\naquatic contaminant,13 which in turn sparked\nan expansion of method development and pharmaceutical research in\nsubsequent years.14,15 These studies have vastly improved\nthe reliability, availability, and precision of pharmaceutical detection\nmethods.14 The shift from gas to\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography with\ntandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) has been a key driver in improving\nknowledge in recent years.16 Despite the\navailability of these methods, analysis and monitoring of pharmaceuticals\nin freshwaters remains far from routine and research is often sporadic\nand isolated. This is despite an increased awareness of the potential\neffects of pharmaceuticals on ecosystems and the services they provide.16−20 Existing research indicates that pharmaceuticals are generally present\nin freshwaters within the ng L–1 range and, at these\nsubtherapeutic levels, the risk of acute toxicity is thought to be\nnegligible.21 However, there are substantial\nknowledge gaps in terms of chronic, long-term exposure of nontarget\naquatic organisms and the effects on ecosystem functioning.16 Data are available to suggest that some compounds\nmay display chronic effects at or close to the levels detected in\nthe environment.17,20 Moreover, the development of\nantibiotic resistant bacteria is a major public health concern; the\nprudent use of pharmaceuticals in the future is seen as key to reducing\nrisks to public health and the environment.19,22 It is likely that pharmaceutical consumption will increase\nin coming\nyears, particularly in developing countries and those with aging human\ndemographics.23,24 Nevertheless, pharmaceutical\ncompounds currently receive minimal consideration by regulators, policy\nmakers, and managers,25 perhaps because\nthere have been few attempts to amalgamate research findings from\ndisparate spatial and temporal studies. However, the status quo is\nunlikely to remain in future, and the European Union has already started\nthe process of adding the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac to its\nlist of Priority Substances.26 This change\nwill potentially mean that in the future member states must maintain concentrations below a defined\nEnvironmental Quality Standard in an attempt to meet the requirements\nof good ecological status under the Water Framework Directive.27 This study synthesizes the disparate research\non pharmaceutical\noccurrence in freshwaters at national, regional, and global scales.\nIn particular we critique current research effort by compound class\nand individual substance. We also present a critical review of sampling\nstrategies and methods adopted by researchers in this field, a crucial\nfactor in considering how reliable and representative data are. Moreover,\nwe provide a brief summary of the environmental effects of pharmaceuticals\nin freshwater ecosystems to highlight potentially high risk compound\nclasses. The substantial assembled database is provided as a tool\nto better inform future research on the occurrence andeffects of\npharmaceuticals in freshwaters, and to identify key areas where future\nresearch should be focused. Finally, we discuss the benefits of meta-analyses\nsuch as this in support of policy development to target the highest\nrisk and most widespread compounds."

      "text": "A review was conducted via a search of\nthe Web of Knowledge (WoK)\npublications database (http://apps.isiknowledge.com/) on\nMarch 6, 2011. The search term below was applied to the title, abstract,\nand keywords of articles: (((((pharmaceutical* OR API* OR drug*\nOR PPCP* OR PhAC*) AND (aquatic*\nOR river* OR stream* OR “surface water*” OR freshwater*\nOR effluent* OR wastewater* OR “wastewater*”))))) Refined by: Document Types=(ARTICLE OR REVIEW OR ABSTRACT) AND\nResearch Domains=(SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY) AND Languages=(ENGLISH)\nAND Subject Areas=(ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES & ECOLOGY OR PUBLIC,\nENVIRONMENTAL & OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH OR MARINE & FRESHWATER\nBIOLOGY OR WATER RESOURCES OR BIODIVERSITY & CONSERVATION) This was intended to identify all studies that analyzed for pharmaceuticals\nin either STP effluent or receiving waters; there was no restriction\non timespan for this query. Research conducted by governmental departments\nor reported in the “gray” literature is also available;\nfor example the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (http://www.epa.gov/ppcp/) but such work was not included here. The acronyms API (active pharmaceutical\ningredient), PPCP (pharmaceuticals and personal care products), and\nPhAC (pharmaceutically active compound) are the most widely used by\nresearchers in this field. This initial search yielded 57 289\nresults which were sorted by their relevance to the search term (using\nthe in-built WoK algorithm). The refined search criteria yielded\n18 245 results and consequently\nthe study was constrained further to the 28 most common journals returned\nby the search; these 28 accounted for ∼50% of results (9072\nrecords) and included most major environmental and analytical chemistry\njournals. The remaining records were sorted by relevance and the first\n1000 results were examined individually. The cutoff of 1000 and top\n28 journals results was deemed necessary due to the time taken to\nassess each individual data source for the meta-analyses, versus the\n“success rate” for inclusion. The criterion for inclusion\nin the database was that a study explicitly analyzed for, detected,\nand quantified at least one human-use pharmaceutical compound in either\nSTP effluent or receiving waters. From these 1000 studies, only 236\nmet the inclusion criterion (Table 1). While\na more exhaustive search may have improved coverage, the assembled\ndatabase represents the broadest review of the most detailed research\nstudies to date. Analysis of publication dates of the 236 studies showed\na clear\nupward trend from the late 1990s onward (Figure 1). The majority of studies included (>80%) were published between\n2005 and 2010, a trend most likely driven by the advancement of analytical\ntechniques such as HPLC-MS/MS and increased interest in pharmaceutical\npollution.16 This is reflected in the relatively\nhigh number of studies published in analytical chemistry journals\nsuch as Journal of Chromatography A and Analytical\nand Bioanalytical Chemistry (Table 1) despite neither of these journals having a specific environmental\nfocus. Number of publications per year for the 236 published studies included\nin the database shows a rapid increase after 2003. For each of the 236 studies the following data\nwere extracted from\nthe main report body or Supporting Information: Compound(s) detected;\nCountry; Median and maximum concentration(s); Sampling technique(s)\nadopted; Sampling period; Analytical methodologies; Number of samples;\nNumber of detections; Number of no detections; Frequency of detection;\nReferencing information; Any pertinent information (e.g., raw drinking\nwater or estuarine sampling). Median and maximum concentrations were\nrecorded when explicitly stated by authors or in some cases were calculated\nusing data tables and in a small number of cases, concentrations had\nto be derived from graphical representations such as boxplots. Other\nconcentrations stated in the studies were not recorded as it was felt\nthat median levels were appropriately representative of “normal”\nconditions and maxima represent peaks in concentrations indicative\nof a worst-case scenario in terms of ecological effects. The\nratio of maximum:median concentration was also calculated and\nrecorded; this ratio was available for 74% of the studies. For the\npurposes of this review only data concerning receiving waters (and\nnot treated effluent) were subjected to meta-analysis because these\nwere the most relevant indicators of potential effects in freshwater\necosystems. Effluent concentrations are inherently variable28 and are less reliable as indicators of effects\ngiven the broad range of dilution factors and chemical transformations\nto which they are subjected when entering receiving waters. When published\nstudies reporting only treated effluent concentrations were excluded,\na total of 155 studies were retained. Fifty studies (26.8%) contained\nsamples of a nonriverine source (marine, estuarine, groundwater, raw\ndrinking water, or sediment samples); lentic and raw drinking water\nsamples were included as these were deemed relevant. Five studies\ncontained samples extracted from freshwater sediments and although\nthese are relevant to freshwaters, the small number of studies was\ndeemed insufficient to merit inclusion. The full database containing\nall receiving water records is freely available upon request or from http://www.wateratleeds.org. All concentrations were\nrecorded in the database as nanograms per\nliter (ng L–1) to enable direct comparison. Individual\ncompounds were then grouped into the following classes: Antibiotics;\nAntidepressants; Antiepileptics; Antivirals; Blood lipid regulators;\nCancer treatments; Contrast media; Endocrine drugs; Gastro-intestinal\ndrugs; Illicit drugs; Other cardiovascular drugs; Other CNS (central\nnervous system) drugs; Others; Painkillers and Respiratory drugs."

      "text": "Table 2 presents a summary\nof the 61 most\nfrequently encountered pharmaceuticals (out of a total of 203); these\n61 compounds represent the 1st to 50th most frequently studied compounds\nin the database. Median concentrations ranged from 6.2 ng L–1 for the antibiotic sulfathiazole to 163 673 ng L–1 for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin which also had the highest maximum\nconcentration of the entire database at 6 500 000 ng\nL–1. Of these 61 compounds, 39% were antibiotics,\n21% were painkillers, 20% were cardiovascular drugs or blood lipid\nregulators, and 3% were antidepressants. From 155 published\nstudies pharmaceutical compounds were identified\nin receiving waters across 41 countries on all continents except Africa\nand Antarctica (Figure 2). The database included\n1417 records representing 67 903 analyses and median/maximum\nconcentrations from >14 155 samples (27 studies did not\nstate\nsampling numbers) and >24 989 positive detections of pharmaceuticals;\nthis equated to an overall detection frequency of 37%. The results\nillustrated a heavy bias toward research in Europe and North America\nwhich accounted for 80% of studies, with a further 16% in Asia (predominantly\nChina). Only three studies reported from South America and just one\nwas from the Middle East (Israel). The United States had the most\nstudies (34) and Spain, China, Germany, Canada, and the UK were the\nonly other countries to have >10 studies. Seventy-one percent of\nnations\nin the database had three or fewer studies conducted, including very\nlarge or populous nations such as Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan,\nand Australia. Global-scale distribution of the number of published studies\nidentifying\npharmaceuticals in inland surface waters. When examining data at the “continental”\nscale strong\nbiases are again evident (Figure 3). For example,\njust 6/176 provinces in Asia accounted for >50% of published studies\nin that region, with the most populous province in China (Guangdong)\nhaving the highest number at six. In Europe most studies have been\nundertaken in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland (in the Elbe, Rhine,\nEbro, and Llobregat basins). The spread of research in the UK is even,\ncovering most counties except South West England and Northern Ireland;\nhowever these are generally isolated, with the only repeated work\nundertaken in Wales, Greater London, and the North East. A similar\nstory is evident in North America with a good spread of research but\nmultiple studies in the populated states of California, New York,\nand Ontario; 9 Canadian provinces (69%) and 28 U.S. states (55%) have\njust one or fewer studies. Number of published studies detecting at least\none pharmaceutical\ncompound in (a) European regions, (b) North American states, and (c)\nsouth Asian provinces. Globally, painkillers were the most frequently\ndetected compounds\naccounting for 31% of records with a median concentration of 230 ng\nL–1 followed by antibiotics (21%, 8128 ng L–1; Figure 4a). The remaining\ncompound classes each demonstrated medians of <100 ng L–1 except for Others (830 ng L–1 including antiepileptics\nand contrast media). The picture changes when data are examined regionally\n(Figure 4b–d). For example, the most\ncommonly encountered pharmaceuticals were painkillers in Europe (34%,\nmedian concentration 261 ng L–1) and antibiotics\nin North America (38%, 71 ng L–1) and Asia (42%,\n33,446 ng L–1). Contrast media and respiratory drugs\nhad particularly high median concentrations in Asian waters of 1257\nand 50 023 ng L–1 respectively, although\nthese were from a small number of studies contaminated by effluent\nfrom pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.29,30 Additionally, antidepressants were more frequently detected in North\nAmerica (9%, 25 ng L–1) compared to Europe and Asia\nwhere they account for <1% of records. Mean detection frequency is the\nmean of all stated or calculated detection frequencies (no. positive\ndetections/no. samples analyzed) for that particular compound. Sixty-two\nstudies representing 32.2% of all database records did not state a\ndetection frequency, or sampling numbers to enable its calculation. Relative frequency of detection and median concentration of pharmaceuticals\nin receiving waters: (a) global, (b) Europe, (c) North America, and\n(d) Asia. (The circumference of each fan is scaled by the relative\nproportion of detections. Each point outward on the radial axis represents\n10y of the median concentration in ng\nL–1. For example, the innermost circle represents\n101 ng L–1; the second represents 102 ng L–1, etc.) A striking result from mean concentrations in the\ntop 10 most studied\ncountries was that all except China demonstrated very low proportions\nof the global mean (<2%) for antibiotics (Figure 5); this was due to the very high concentrations detected in\na small number of Asian studies. Interestingly, China displayed values\nwell below the global means for all compound classes ranging from\n2 to 25%. Spain was above the global mean (171–441%) for all\nclasses except Antibiotics and Others compared to Italy, Switzerland,\nJapan, and the UK which were below the global mean for all classes.\nNo single country in the top 10 demonstrated mean concentrations above\n40% of the global mean for Others. This is due to there being only\nseven countries within this group which are heavily skewed by one\nstudy in India detecting very high concentrations (15 000 ng\nL–1) of the antifungal terbinafine.29 Comparison of national averages of pharmaceuticals to the global\naverage for (a) the 1st to 5th and (b) the 6th to 10th top countries\n(as determined by number of entries in the database; represented by\nthe number in brackets. Global mean is the mean concentration for\nall records of that compound group). (Values exceeding 200% of global\nmean: Spain (blood lipid regulators 441%, other cardiovascular drugs\n213%, painkillers 209%), Germany (antidepressants 246%), South Korea\n(other cardiovascular drugs 404%)). The top 20 most frequently studied compounds in\nEurope included\n8 painkillers, 6 cardiovascular drugs, and 4 antibiotics with median\nconcentrations for all compounds below 100 ng L–1 except aspirin and paracetamol (median approximately 190 ng L–1; Figure 6). A similar picture\nwas evident in North America and Asia with mostly antibiotics, cardiovascular\ndrugs, and painkillers present in the top 20 and median concentrations\ngenerally <100 ng L–1. A small number of compounds\n(6 in Europe and Asia and 2 in North America) had maxima >10 000\nng L–1. Of particular note was the antiepileptic\ndrug carbamazepine which was the most frequently studied and detected\ncompound in both North America and Europe and third in Asia. The minimum\ndetection frequency for compounds displayed in Figure 6 was 9% (diclofenac in North America) but average detections\nfrequencies were 70% (Europe), 27% (North America), and 65% (Asia).

(Boxes represent interquartile\nranges with median concentration represented by the horizontal line.\nWhiskers show the range of data and asterisks represent outliers). A major finding from this analysis was that 45%\nof European and\nAsian and 23% of North America studies failed to provide any details\nof the sampling regime and techniques adopted (Figure 7). Isolated and nonrepeated grab sampling was by far the most\ncommon technique adopted in 31–34% of studies. Slightly more\nrepresentative repeated grab sampling over periods ranging from days\nto years was adopted in just 12% of studies. Additional techniques\nare available including composite sampling and the use of passive\nsamplers (e.g., polar organic contaminant integrative sampling, POCIS)\nwhich give an integrated sample over a period of days to weeks. However,\nthese were adopted by just 11% of European and 9% of North American\nstudies and not at all elsewhere.

(n = number\nof records in the database; POCIS = polar organic contaminant integrative\nsampler). Chronic effects data for the six main compound\nclasses were collated\nfrom four major reviews17,20,21,177 and any duplicate results were\nremoved manually. Chronic data (rather than acute) was chosen as these\nwere deemed to be more representative of actual long-term, low-level\nexposure of aquatic organisms;178 the end\npoints assessed included lethal and sublethal indices (e.g., feeding,\ngrowth, behavior, and reproduction). The data included here are not\nintended as a direct assessment of particular compound toxicity but\nrather to highlight where overlaps between measured environmental\nconcentrations and chronic toxicity indicate potential environmental\nrisk. The ranges of chronic toxicity vary markedly across compound\ntypes\nand taxa (Figure 8). From these data antidepressants\nappear to pose particular risk to all taxa except bacteria with effective\nconcentrations ranging from μg to mg L–1.\nInvertebrates and fish show chronic toxic effects at sub mg L–1 levels for cardiovascular drugs and Others; fish\nalso appear susceptible to painkillers with median effects manifesting\nat 40 μg L–1. This summary highlights where\nresearch is lacking; in particular there were no studies examining\nthe effects of antibiotics on fish, antidepressants on aquatic plants,\nor cardiovascular drugs on bacteria. Overall, bacteria and aquatic\nplants appear to be the least well studied whereas research on chronic\neffects in aquatic invertebrates is relatively abundant.

      "text": "This study shows that\nknowledge of pharmaceutical occurrence is poor or absent for large\nparts of the globe, particularly in developing countries. The research\nthat has been undertaken displays a heavy bias toward North America,\nEurope, and the more populous parts of China. Given that the consumption\nof pharmaceuticals is ubiquitous across the globe,179 there is clearly a pressing need to expand research into\ntheir occurrence particularly in Russia, southern Asia, Africa, the\nMiddle East, South America, and eastern Europe. As more data becomes\navailable, the better able researchers will be to highlight the scale\nof the problem and inform management decisions. Moreover, even where\nstudies have been relatively numerous knowledge is still minimal compared\nto that for other stressors such as nutrients,180,181 acidification,182 river regulation,183 and sedimentation.184 When looking at the spread of research it is apparent that\nthe spatial biases manifest at multiple scales. In Europe, an obvious\ncluster of research is evident around central Europe particularly\nand to a lesser extent in the UK and Spain. Research effort appears\nto be clustered around the high population areas of e.g., London,\nParis, Hamburg, Frankfurt, California and the North American eastern\nseaboard, Beijing and Guangdong province in China. This is understandable\ngiven that pharmaceutical pollution can be expected to be at its greatest\nin densely populated areas, and a risk-based approach185 should target these receiving waters first. However, this\nleaves substantial proportions of Europe and North America with insufficient\nresearch. For example, in the UK no research has been conducted in\nthe major urban areas of the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, or\nWest Yorkshire which have a combined population of 6 million people.186 Researchers should expand monitoring efforts\nto previously unstudied catchments while at the same time increasing\nthe length/breadth and temporal resolution of monitoring campaigns\nif the dynamics of pharmaceutical pollution are to be fully understood.\nResearch in less densely populated and rural areas should also be\na priority as it is probable that STPs in such locations are smaller\nand less advanced when compared to their larger counterparts serving\nurban areas.187 When viewed globally,\nantibiotics, antiepileptics, cardiovascular drugs (including blood\nlipid regulators), and painkillers accounted for 86% of all database\nrecords with carbamazepine being the single most commonly identified\ncompound. A likely reason for this bias is that these drug types are\nthe most widely prescribed and purchased over-the-counter.188,189 For example, cardiovascular drugs and painkillers were among the\ntop three compound types prescribed to adults in the U.S. during 2007189 and as such could be expected to enter the\nenvironment in the highest concentrations. However, this leaves major\ngroups of potentially toxic pharmaceuticals being poorly studied.\nFor example, antidepressants, antivirals, cancer treatments, tranquilizers,\nand antifungals combined accounted for just 6.3% of records. A reason\nfor this imbalance in detections could be that researchers have not\nbeen analyzing these compounds in environmental samples, rather than\ntheir being genuinely scarce. It may also be possible that less frequently\ndetected compounds are less refractory and are more efficiently removed\nduring sewage treatment (e.g., (9)). Further studies on these “rarer” compounds\nare particularly necessary because some studies have shown effects\non microalgal communities even at very low environmental concentrations.190 Interestingly, antidepressants were the most\nwidely prescribed compounds among young American adults,189 and this is reflected in the relatively high\nnumber of North American studies analyzing these compounds (9%) when\ncompared to Asia and Europe (1%). The analysis confirmed that\nknowledge of some pharmaceutical groups is almost completely lacking,\nwith >50% of entries in the database represented by just 14 compounds\n(all of which are antibiotics, antiepileptics, cardiovascular drugs,\nor painkillers). The entire database represents only a snapshot (203)\nof all pharmaceuticals approved for use, which is estimated to be\nwell over 5000 in Europe alone.191 This\ngives a conservative estimate that fewer than 4% of pharmaceuticals\nhave been analyzed for and detected in freshwaters. It demonstrates\na clear need for future research to be expanded across the less well\nstudied compounds, particularly those identified as posing environmental\nrisk. One of\nthe most striking results from the data was the relatively high concentrations\nfor antibiotics and Others (comprising just the respiratory drug ceterizine\nand the contrast medium ioprimide in Asia) compared to other classes.\nHowever, these very high concentrations were skewed by a small number\nof studies which analyzed waters receiving pharmaceutical manufacturing\neffluent.29,30 Up until recently pharmaceutical manufacturing\nfacilities (PMFs) were considered a low priority given the high value\nof pharmaceutical products and the adoption of “good management\npractice” by the industry intended to reduce wastage and loss\nto the environment.192 However, several\nstudies have shown that PMFs can be a significant source of pharmaceuticals\nto receiving waters both within developed (e.g., (193)) and developing countries\n(e.g., refs (30, 194)); these\nshould be considered a priority for future research effort given the\npotential for strong localized effects. National means were\ncompared to global means to evaluate the appropriateness of local\nstudies as indicators of concentrations at larger spatial scales.\nThese comparisons highlight the importance of local studies to inform\nstakeholders and regulators, and emphasize a need for caution when\nscaling up to larger spatial scales, or vice versa. Given the relative\npaucity of data it is possible for a small number of studies at particularly\npolluted locations to have a disproportionate influence on national\nand even global mean concentrations. The very high concentrations\nfor antibiotics in Asia and globally are an example of this problem.\nThe global median antibiotic concentration (8135 ng L–1) reduces (58 ng L–1) if just two Chinese and Indian\nstudies are excluded.29,30 Ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole\nwere consistently within the top five studied compounds across all\nregions and had similar concentration ranges (1–10 000\nng L–1). Notably though, very high concentrations\n(up to a maximum of 10 000 000 ng L–1) of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin were\nevident in Asia; this is of concern because these are well within\nthe range known to cause acute and chronic toxic effects to aquatic\norganisms.20 Also of note was the presence\nof the antidepressant fluoxetine in the top 20 North American compounds;\nthis type of antidepressant causes chronic effects at the low ng L–1 range,195,196 well below the median\nand maximum concentrations detected in the environment. Carbamazepine\nis the single most widely studied and detected compound in Europe\nand North America but is not generally considered to pose a risk of\nacute or chronic toxicity to freshwater organisms (e.g., (197)). However, its refractory\nnature and generally ubiquitous presence in STP effluent may make\ncarbamazepine a useful source-specific tracer of domestic wastewater\ncontamination.198 Perhaps the most crucial step in\nreliably quantifying the presence of compounds such as pharmaceuticals\nin freshwaters is the collection of a representative sample using\nappropriate strategies and methodologies.199,200 Sampling uncertainty can often exceed that during the analytical\nprocedure.201 Large sample numbers and\nsophisticated analytical techniques, although important, should not\nbe seen as a substitute for the collection of a representative sample199 and a poor sampling can be the dominant source\nof error in water quality data.202 Some\nexponents of sampling theory have gone so far as to argue that “nothing\ngood (certainly nothing representative) has ever come from grab sampling”203 due to the fact they provide a mere snapshot\nin time. Grab sampling does have a part to play in furthering our\nunderstanding of pharmaceutical occurrence particularly for extensive\nspatial or long-term studies where the equipment and set-up costs\nof more representative techniques may be prohibitive. However, efforts\nshould be made to adopt more representative techniques wherever possible.\nFor pharmaceuticals in particular, non-repeated grab sampling is unlikely\nto be representative as sample concentrations have been shown to vary\nconsiderably over time.28 A possible\nexplanation for the lack of robust sampling is the relatively high\nproportion of studies published in journals with a focus on analytical\nchemistry (namely Journal of Chromatography A, Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, and Talanta). The main thrust of these journals is method development rather\nthan the collection of large, representative data sets and this is\nborne out by the fact that 64% of these papers did not state the sampling\nmethodologies adopted (c.f. 44% across all journals) and only 11%\nof studies adopted repeated grab or composite sampling strategies\n(c.f. 21–23% across all journals). This propensity of analytical\nstudies to collect fewer samples for shorter periods is probably due\nto analytical chemists needing to validate methods on “real”\nsamples which require only minimal numbers to achieve. The contribution\nof these papers should not be understated though, as they provide\nreliable and sophisticated analytical methods that can be adopted\nas part of more representative sampling studies. The occurrence data\nalone provided by these studies covers 94 compounds in 34 countries,\nso minor modifications to sampling strategies and subsequent reporting\nby these scientists could benefit the field substantially. In\naddition to the techniques adopted, appropriate sampling numbers,\nduration, and frequency are crucial to obtain a reliable quantification\nof variable water quality parameters. Most studies collected a relatively\nsmall number of samples (1–50) with only 13% of studies collecting\nfor >12 months. This indicates a dearth of long-term monitoring\nwhich\nmay be crucial in understanding seasonal and annual dynamics. Conversely,\nsampling at an appropriately high temporal resolution over the short-term\nis equally important if we are to fully quantify variability over\nthe periods of minutes to days (e.g., refs (28, 199, 200)). Studies\non other aquatic contaminants have shown the importance of a robust\nsampling strategy; Rabiet et al.205 demonstrated\nthat fixed time interval grab sampling underestimated pesticide fluxes\nfrom a small catchment by as much as a factor of 5. Robertson206 recommended tailoring sampling strategies to\nthe variable of interest and the duration of the study when monitoring\nin small streams. An interesting research question would be the systematic\ncomparison of measured concentrations between grab sampling and continuous\nor composite techniques; the database assembled here may prove useful\nin such a study. These data clearly highlight the importance\nof adopting flexible,\nappropriate sampling strategies in order to supply reliable and representative\ndata. Furthermore, researchers should explicitly state the techniques\nemployed in addition to sample numbers, frequencies, and locations\nso that other researchers can fairly evaluate the results presented\nand use them to inform their own research. Despite the widespread presence of many pharmaceuticals in freshwaters,\nsome risk assessments have suggested that they pose little risk of\nacute or chronic toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations.17,207 The data summaries presented here and elsewhere indicate potential\noverlap between chronic effects levels and the concentrations detected\nwithin freshwaters. In particular, potential risks are evident for\ninvertebrates and fish from antibiotics and cardiovascular drugs in\nAsia and from the contrast media, tranquilizers, and antiepileptics\n(carbamazepine) across all regions. Additionally, invertebrates and\nfish are potentially at risk (i.e., low margin of safety) from antidepressants\nand painkillers in North America. While this may suggest that future\nresearch should shift toward less well studied but more “toxic”\ncompounds, particular care needs to be taken with these conclusions\nbecause many effects studies on aquatic “ecosystems”\nhave been undertaken using ecologically unrealistic (i.e., single\nspecies) laboratory experiments. Additionally, such studies tend to\ntest at concentrations that are orders of magnitude above those detected\nin the environment and be run over short time-scales, and as such\ndo not adequately address the issue of low-level, chronic exposure.\nStudies which have examined the effects of low-level pharmaceutical\nexposure on aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning are rare but\nhave indicated that pharmaceuticals can display significant effects\non important ecosystem services.208−211 The data presented here\nare a useful indicator of particular compound classes exhibiting some\nkind of toxic effect at the levels stated. As such, the combined occurrence\nand effects data sets can serve as a guide for future ecotoxicological\nresearch. However, they should be treated with caution as they integrate\na variety of toxicological tests which employ a range of exposures\nand end points across a variety of species. The exposure regime of\nany testing should attempt to cover both the median as a measure of\nfrequently encountered concentrations, and the maximum concentration\nas an indicator of worst-case exposure. Furthermore, standard assessments\nof toxicity, while useful in producing comparable results, suffer\nfrom low bio-complexity and environmental relevance, so researchers\nneed to adopt a more flexible, knowledge-based approach tailored to\nspecific risks.212 A problem with undertaking\nresearch in “natural” freshwaters is that there will\nprobably be myriad other compounds in addition to the one of interest,\nmeaning a high potential for confounding effects. More realistic controlled\nexperiments need to be designed and undertaken (e.g., (213)) before researchers can\nmake better predictions about ecosystem response to pharmaceutical\npollution. Researchers and regulators must therefore be wary of dismissing\nparticular pharmaceuticals as “low risk” on the basis\nof isolated and overly simplified laboratory studies."

      "text": "This study shows that\nknowledge of pharmaceutical occurrence is poor or absent for large\nparts of the globe, particularly in developing countries. The research\nthat has been undertaken displays a heavy bias toward North America,\nEurope, and the more populous parts of China. Given that the consumption\nof pharmaceuticals is ubiquitous across the globe,179 there is clearly a pressing need to expand research into\ntheir occurrence particularly in Russia, southern Asia, Africa, the\nMiddle East, South America, and eastern Europe. As more data becomes\navailable, the better able researchers will be to highlight the scale\nof the problem and inform management decisions. Moreover, even where\nstudies have been relatively numerous knowledge is still minimal compared\nto that for other stressors such as nutrients,180,181 acidification,182 river regulation,183 and sedimentation.184 When looking at the spread of research it is apparent that\nthe spatial biases manifest at multiple scales. In Europe, an obvious\ncluster of research is evident around central Europe particularly\nand to a lesser extent in the UK and Spain. Research effort appears\nto be clustered around the high population areas of e.g., London,\nParis, Hamburg, Frankfurt, California and the North American eastern\nseaboard, Beijing and Guangdong province in China. This is understandable\ngiven that pharmaceutical pollution can be expected to be at its greatest\nin densely populated areas, and a risk-based approach185 should target these receiving waters first. However, this\nleaves substantial proportions of Europe and North America with insufficient\nresearch. For example, in the UK no research has been conducted in\nthe major urban areas of the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, or\nWest Yorkshire which have a combined population of 6 million people.186 Researchers should expand monitoring efforts\nto previously unstudied catchments while at the same time increasing\nthe length/breadth and temporal resolution of monitoring campaigns\nif the dynamics of pharmaceutical pollution are to be fully understood.\nResearch in less densely populated and rural areas should also be\na priority as it is probable that STPs in such locations are smaller\nand less advanced when compared to their larger counterparts serving\nurban areas.187"

      "title": "Coverage of Compound Classes",
      "text": "When viewed globally,\nantibiotics, antiepileptics, cardiovascular drugs (including blood\nlipid regulators), and painkillers accounted for 86% of all database\nrecords with carbamazepine being the single most commonly identified\ncompound. A likely reason for this bias is that these drug types are\nthe most widely prescribed and purchased over-the-counter.188,189 For example, cardiovascular drugs and painkillers were among the\ntop three compound types prescribed to adults in the U.S. during 2007189 and as such could be expected to enter the\nenvironment in the highest concentrations. However, this leaves major\ngroups of potentially toxic pharmaceuticals being poorly studied.\nFor example, antidepressants, antivirals, cancer treatments, tranquilizers,\nand antifungals combined accounted for just 6.3% of records. A reason\nfor this imbalance in detections could be that researchers have not\nbeen analyzing these compounds in environmental samples, rather than\ntheir being genuinely scarce. It may also be possible that less frequently\ndetected compounds are less refractory and are more efficiently removed\nduring sewage treatment (e.g., (9)). Further studies on these “rarer” compounds\nare particularly necessary because some studies have shown effects\non microalgal communities even at very low environmental concentrations.190 Interestingly, antidepressants were the most\nwidely prescribed compounds among young American adults,189 and this is reflected in the relatively high\nnumber of North American studies analyzing these compounds (9%) when\ncompared to Asia and Europe (1%). The analysis confirmed that\nknowledge of some pharmaceutical groups is almost completely lacking,\nwith >50% of entries in the database represented by just 14 compounds\n(all of which are antibiotics, antiepileptics, cardiovascular drugs,\nor painkillers). The entire database represents only a snapshot (203)\nof all pharmaceuticals approved for use, which is estimated to be\nwell over 5000 in Europe alone.191 This\ngives a conservative estimate that fewer than 4% of pharmaceuticals\nhave been analyzed for and detected in freshwaters. It demonstrates\na clear need for future research to be expanded across the less well\nstudied compounds, particularly those identified as posing environmental\nrisk."

Given the relative\npaucity of data it is possible for a small number of studies at particularly\npolluted locations to have a disproportionate influence on national\nand even global mean concentrations.

      "title": "Sampling Strategies",
      "text": "Perhaps the most crucial step in\nreliably quantifying the presence of compounds such as pharmaceuticals\nin freshwaters is the collection of a representative sample using\nappropriate strategies and methodologies.199,200 Sampling uncertainty can often exceed that during the analytical\nprocedure.201 Large sample numbers and\nsophisticated analytical techniques, although important, should not\nbe seen as a substitute for the collection of a representative sample199 and a poor sampling can be the dominant source\nof error in water quality data.202 Some\nexponents of sampling theory have gone so far as to argue that “nothing\ngood (certainly nothing representative) has ever come from grab sampling”203 due to the fact they provide a mere snapshot\nin time. Grab sampling does have a part to play in furthering our\nunderstanding of pharmaceutical occurrence particularly for extensive\nspatial or long-term studies where the equipment and set-up costs\nof more representative techniques may be prohibitive. However, efforts\nshould be made to adopt more representative techniques wherever possible.\nFor pharmaceuticals in particular, non-repeated grab sampling is unlikely\nto be representative as sample concentrations have been shown to vary\nconsiderably over time.28 A possible\nexplanation for the lack of robust sampling is the relatively high\nproportion of studies published in journals with a focus on analytical\nchemistry (namely Journal of Chromatography A, Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, and Talanta). The main thrust of these journals is method development rather\nthan the collection of large, representative data sets and this is\nborne out by the fact that 64% of these papers did not state the sampling\nmethodologies adopted (c.f. 44% across all journals) and only 11%\nof studies adopted repeated grab or composite sampling strategies\n(c.f. 21–23% across all journals). This propensity of analytical\nstudies to collect fewer samples for shorter periods is probably due\nto analytical chemists needing to validate methods on “real”\nsamples which require only minimal numbers to achieve. The contribution\nof these papers should not be understated though, as they provide\nreliable and sophisticated analytical methods that can be adopted\nas part of more representative sampling studies. The occurrence data\nalone provided by these studies covers 94 compounds in 34 countries,\nso minor modifications to sampling strategies and subsequent reporting\nby these scientists could benefit the field substantially. In\naddition to the techniques adopted, appropriate sampling numbers,\nduration, and frequency are crucial to obtain a reliable quantification\nof variable water quality parameters. Most studies collected a relatively\nsmall number of samples (1–50) with only 13% of studies collecting\nfor >12 months. This indicates a dearth of long-term monitoring\nwhich\nmay be crucial in understanding seasonal and annual dynamics. Conversely,\nsampling at an appropriately high temporal resolution over the short-term\nis equally important if we are to fully quantify variability over\nthe periods of minutes to days (e.g., refs (28, 199, 200)). Studies\non other aquatic contaminants have shown the importance of a robust\nsampling strategy; Rabiet et al.205 demonstrated\nthat fixed time interval grab sampling underestimated pesticide fluxes\nfrom a small catchment by as much as a factor of 5. Robertson206 recommended tailoring sampling strategies to\nthe variable of interest and the duration of the study when monitoring\nin small streams. An interesting research question would be the systematic\ncomparison of measured concentrations between grab sampling and continuous\nor composite techniques; the database assembled here may prove useful\nin such a study. These data clearly highlight the importance\nof adopting flexible,\nappropriate sampling strategies in order to supply reliable and representative\ndata. Furthermore, researchers should explicitly state the techniques\nemployed in addition to sample numbers, frequencies, and locations\nso that other researchers can fairly evaluate the results presented\nand use them to inform their own research."

      "text": "This study is the first to assemble a comprehensive\ndatabase of\nwidely distributed information on pharmaceutical concentrations at\nglobal, continental, national, and provincial scales. In doing so\nit has highlighted large parts of the globe where knowledge of pharmaceutical\noccurrence is minimal or nonexistent. In particular, large parts of\nAsia, Africa, South America, and Australia should be seen as a priority\nfor future research. Additionally, the majority of countries where\nresearch is sparse or absent are developing nations, and as such it\nis possible that the pharmaceutical consumption (and hence pollution)\nprofile may differ markedly from that of developed nations. It may\nbe the case that in developing countries water resource management\nhas not yet progressed to the stage where environmental monitoring\nand regulation of pollutants typically start to be taken seriously.214 Even within the developed nations of\nEurope and North America there\nis a pressing need for better spatial coverage across all provinces\nand states.

The most striking results of this study were the very high concentrations\nreported (particularly antibiotics, painkillers, and antidepressants)\nthat are within the range known to cause acute or chronic toxicity\nin aquatic systems. This challenges the assumption that pharmaceuticals\nin rivers generally pose little risk28 and\nhighlights the need for an expansion of robust monitoring and the\nadoption of more realistic ecotoxicological experiments.

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nPharmaceuticals have been used by humans\nfor centuries with commercialization\nbeginning in the late 19th Century. Aside from pioneering studies\nin the 1970s and 1980s1−3 pharmaceuticals have only emerged as a major group\nof environmental contaminants over the last 15 years.4−7 Their presence in numerous environmental compartments including\nsurface and ground waters, soils, and biota is now well established8 and the predominant pathway of entry to the environment\nis considered to be postconsumption excretion to the sewer network\nand subsequent passage to rivers via straight piping, sewage treatment\nplants (STPs; where their removal is variable e.g., ref (9)) or sewer overflows.10−12 Pesticide research in the 1990s identified clofibric acid as a widespread\naquatic contaminant,13 which in turn sparked\nan expansion of method development and pharmaceutical research in\nsubsequent years.14,15 These studies have vastly improved\nthe reliability, availability, and precision of pharmaceutical detection\nmethods.14 The shift from gas to\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography with\ntandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) has been a key driver in improving\nknowledge in recent years.16 Despite the\navailability of these methods, analysis and monitoring of pharmaceuticals\nin freshwaters remains far from routine and research is often sporadic\nand isolated. This is despite an increased awareness of the potential\neffects of pharmaceuticals on ecosystems and the services they provide.16−20 Existing research indicates that pharmaceuticals are generally present\nin freshwaters within the ng L–1 range and, at these\nsubtherapeutic levels, the risk of acute toxicity is thought to be\nnegligible.21 However, there are substantial\nknowledge gaps in terms of chronic, long-term exposure of nontarget\naquatic organisms and the effects on ecosystem functioning.16 Data are available to suggest that some compounds\nmay display chronic effects at or close to the levels detected in\nthe environment.17,20 Moreover, the development of\nantibiotic resistant bacteria is a major public health concern; the\nprudent use of pharmaceuticals in the future is seen as key to reducing\nrisks to public health and the environment.19,22 It is likely that pharmaceutical consumption will increase\nin coming\nyears, particularly in developing countries and those with aging human\ndemographics.23,24 Nevertheless, pharmaceutical\ncompounds currently receive minimal consideration by regulators, policy\nmakers, and managers,25 perhaps because\nthere have been few attempts to amalgamate research findings from\ndisparate spatial and temporal studies. However, the status quo is\nunlikely to remain in future, and the European Union has already started\nthe process of adding the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac to its\nlist of Priority Substances.26 This change\nwill potentially mean that in the future member states must maintain concentrations below a defined\nEnvironmental Quality Standard in an attempt to meet the requirements\nof good ecological status under the Water Framework Directive.27 This study synthesizes the disparate research\non pharmaceutical\noccurrence in freshwaters at national, regional, and global scales.\nIn particular we critique current research effort by compound class\nand individual substance. We also present a critical review of sampling\nstrategies and methods adopted by researchers in this field, a crucial\nfactor in considering how reliable and representative data are. Moreover,\nwe provide a brief summary of the environmental effects of pharmaceuticals\nin freshwater ecosystems to highlight potentially high risk compound\nclasses. The substantial assembled database is provided as a tool\nto better inform future research on the occurrence andeffects of\npharmaceuticals in freshwaters, and to identify key areas where future\nresearch should be focused. Finally, we discuss the benefits of meta-analyses\nsuch as this in support of policy development to target the highest\nrisk and most widespread compounds.\n\n## Methodology\nA review was conducted via a search of\nthe Web of Knowledge (WoK)\npublications database (http://apps.isiknowledge.com/) on\nMarch 6, 2011. The search term below was applied to the title, abstract,\nand keywords of articles: (((((pharmaceutical* OR API* OR drug*\nOR PPCP* OR PhAC*) AND (aquatic*\nOR river* OR stream* OR “surface water*” OR freshwater*\nOR effluent* OR wastewater* OR “wastewater*”))))) Refined by: Document Types=(ARTICLE OR REVIEW OR ABSTRACT) AND\nResearch Domains=(SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY) AND Languages=(ENGLISH)\nAND Subject Areas=(ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES & ECOLOGY OR PUBLIC,\nENVIRONMENTAL & OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH OR MARINE & FRESHWATER\nBIOLOGY OR WATER RESOURCES OR BIODIVERSITY & CONSERVATION) This was intended to identify all studies that analyzed for pharmaceuticals\nin either STP effluent or receiving waters; there was no restriction\non timespan for this query. Research conducted by governmental departments\nor reported in the “gray” literature is also available;\nfor example the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (http://www.epa.gov/ppcp/) but such work was not included here. The acronyms API (active pharmaceutical\ningredient), PPCP (pharmaceuticals and personal care products), and\nPhAC (pharmaceutically active compound) are the most widely used by\nresearchers in this field. This initial search yielded 57 289\nresults which were sorted by their relevance to the search term (using\nthe in-built WoK algorithm). The refined search criteria yielded\n18 245 results and consequently\nthe study was constrained further to the 28 most common journals returned\nby the search; these 28 accounted for ∼50% of results (9072\nrecords) and included most major environmental and analytical chemistry\njournals. The remaining records were sorted by relevance and the first\n1000 results were examined individually. The cutoff of 1000 and top\n28 journals results was deemed necessary due to the time taken to\nassess each individual data source for the meta-analyses, versus the\n“success rate” for inclusion. The criterion for inclusion\nin the database was that a study explicitly analyzed for, detected,\nand quantified at least one human-use pharmaceutical compound in either\nSTP effluent or receiving waters. From these 1000 studies, only 236\nmet the inclusion criterion (Table 1). While\na more exhaustive search may have improved coverage, the assembled\ndatabase represents the broadest review of the most detailed research\nstudies to date. Analysis of publication dates of the 236 studies showed\na clear\nupward trend from the late 1990s onward (Figure 1). The majority of studies included (>80%) were published between\n2005 and 2010, a trend most likely driven by the advancement of analytical\ntechniques such as HPLC-MS/MS and increased interest in pharmaceutical\npollution.16 This is reflected in the relatively\nhigh number of studies published in analytical chemistry journals\nsuch as Journal of Chromatography A and Analytical\nand Bioanalytical Chemistry (Table 1) despite neither of these journals having a specific environmental\nfocus. Number of publications per year for the 236 published studies included\nin the database shows a rapid increase after 2003. For each of the 236 studies the following data\nwere extracted from\nthe main report body or Supporting Information: Compound(s) detected;\nCountry; Median and maximum concentration(s); Sampling technique(s)\nadopted; Sampling period; Analytical methodologies; Number of samples;\nNumber of detections; Number of no detections; Frequency of detection;\nReferencing information; Any pertinent information (e.g., raw drinking\nwater or estuarine sampling). Median and maximum concentrations were\nrecorded when explicitly stated by authors or in some cases were calculated\nusing data tables and in a small number of cases, concentrations had\nto be derived from graphical representations such as boxplots. Other\nconcentrations stated in the studies were not recorded as it was felt\nthat median levels were appropriately representative of “normal”\nconditions and maxima represent peaks in concentrations indicative\nof a worst-case scenario in terms of ecological effects. The\nratio of maximum:median concentration was also calculated and\nrecorded; this ratio was available for 74% of the studies. For the\npurposes of this review only data concerning receiving waters (and\nnot treated effluent) were subjected to meta-analysis because these\nwere the most relevant indicators of potential effects in freshwater\necosystems. Effluent concentrations are inherently variable28 and are less reliable as indicators of effects\ngiven the broad range of dilution factors and chemical transformations\nto which they are subjected when entering receiving waters. When published\nstudies reporting only treated effluent concentrations were excluded,\na total of 155 studies were retained. Fifty studies (26.8%) contained\nsamples of a nonriverine source (marine, estuarine, groundwater, raw\ndrinking water, or sediment samples); lentic and raw drinking water\nsamples were included as these were deemed relevant. Five studies\ncontained samples extracted from freshwater sediments and although\nthese are relevant to freshwaters, the small number of studies was\ndeemed insufficient to merit inclusion. The full database containing\nall receiving water records is freely available upon request or from http://www.wateratleeds.org. All concentrations were\nrecorded in the database as nanograms per\nliter (ng L–1) to enable direct comparison. Individual\ncompounds were then grouped into the following classes: Antibiotics;\nAntidepressants; Antiepileptics; Antivirals; Blood lipid regulators;\nCancer treatments; Contrast media; Endocrine drugs; Gastro-intestinal\ndrugs; Illicit drugs; Other cardiovascular drugs; Other CNS (central\nnervous system) drugs; Others; Painkillers and Respiratory drugs.\n\n## Results\nTable 2 presents a summary\nof the 61 most\nfrequently encountered pharmaceuticals (out of a total of 203); these\n61 compounds represent the 1st to 50th most frequently studied compounds\nin the database. Median concentrations ranged from 6.2 ng L–1 for the antibiotic sulfathiazole to 163 673 ng L–1 for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin which also had the highest maximum\nconcentration of the entire database at 6 500 000 ng\nL–1. Of these 61 compounds, 39% were antibiotics,\n21% were painkillers, 20% were cardiovascular drugs or blood lipid\nregulators, and 3% were antidepressants. From 155 published\nstudies pharmaceutical compounds were identified\nin receiving waters across 41 countries on all continents except Africa\nand Antarctica (Figure 2). The database included\n1417 records representing 67 903 analyses and median/maximum\nconcentrations from >14 155 samples (27 studies did not\nstate\nsampling numbers) and >24 989 positive detections of pharmaceuticals;\nthis equated to an overall detection frequency of 37%. The results\nillustrated a heavy bias toward research in Europe and North America\nwhich accounted for 80% of studies, with a further 16% in Asia (predominantly\nChina). Only three studies reported from South America and just one\nwas from the Middle East (Israel). The United States had the most\nstudies (34) and Spain, China, Germany, Canada, and the UK were the\nonly other countries to have >10 studies. Seventy-one percent of\nnations\nin the database had three or fewer studies conducted, including very\nlarge or populous nations such as Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan,\nand Australia. Global-scale distribution of the number of published studies\nidentifying\npharmaceuticals in inland surface waters. When examining data at the “continental”\nscale strong\nbiases are again evident (Figure 3). For example,\njust 6/176 provinces in Asia accounted for >50% of published studies\nin that region, with the most populous province in China (Guangdong)\nhaving the highest number at six. In Europe most studies have been\nundertaken in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland (in the Elbe, Rhine,\nEbro, and Llobregat basins). The spread of research in the UK is even,\ncovering most counties except South West England and Northern Ireland;\nhowever these are generally isolated, with the only repeated work\nundertaken in Wales, Greater London, and the North East. A similar\nstory is evident in North America with a good spread of research but\nmultiple studies in the populated states of California, New York,\nand Ontario; 9 Canadian provinces (69%) and 28 U.S. states (55%) have\njust one or fewer studies. Number of published studies detecting at least\none pharmaceutical\ncompound in (a) European regions, (b) North American states, and (c)\nsouth Asian provinces. Globally, painkillers were the most frequently\ndetected compounds\naccounting for 31% of records with a median concentration of 230 ng\nL–1 followed by antibiotics (21%, 8128 ng L–1; Figure 4a). The remaining\ncompound classes each demonstrated medians of <100 ng L–1 except for Others (830 ng L–1 including antiepileptics\nand contrast media). The picture changes when data are examined regionally\n(Figure 4b–d). For example, the most\ncommonly encountered pharmaceuticals were painkillers in Europe (34%,\nmedian concentration 261 ng L–1) and antibiotics\nin North America (38%, 71 ng L–1) and Asia (42%,\n33,446 ng L–1). Contrast media and respiratory drugs\nhad particularly high median concentrations in Asian waters of 1257\nand 50 023 ng L–1 respectively, although\nthese were from a small number of studies contaminated by effluent\nfrom pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.29,30 Additionally, antidepressants were more frequently detected in North\nAmerica (9%, 25 ng L–1) compared to Europe and Asia\nwhere they account for <1% of records. Mean detection frequency is the\nmean of all stated or calculated detection frequencies (no. positive\ndetections/no. samples analyzed) for that particular compound. Sixty-two\nstudies representing 32.2% of all database records did not state a\ndetection frequency, or sampling numbers to enable its calculation. Relative frequency of detection and median concentration of pharmaceuticals\nin receiving waters: (a) global, (b) Europe, (c) North America, and\n(d) Asia. (The circumference of each fan is scaled by the relative\nproportion of detections. Each point outward on the radial axis represents\n10y of the median concentration in ng\nL–1. For example, the innermost circle represents\n101 ng L–1; the second represents 102 ng L–1, etc.) A striking result from mean concentrations in the\ntop 10 most studied\ncountries was that all except China demonstrated very low proportions\nof the global mean (<2%) for antibiotics (Figure 5); this was due to the very high concentrations detected in\na small number of Asian studies. Interestingly, China displayed values\nwell below the global means for all compound classes ranging from\n2 to 25%. Spain was above the global mean (171–441%) for all\nclasses except Antibiotics and Others compared to Italy, Switzerland,\nJapan, and the UK which were below the global mean for all classes.\nNo single country in the top 10 demonstrated mean concentrations above\n40% of the global mean for Others. This is due to there being only\nseven countries within this group which are heavily skewed by one\nstudy in India detecting very high concentrations (15 000 ng\nL–1) of the antifungal terbinafine.29 Comparison of national averages of pharmaceuticals to the global\naverage for (a) the 1st to 5th and (b) the 6th to 10th top countries\n(as determined by number of entries in the database; represented by\nthe number in brackets. Global mean is the mean concentration for\nall records of that compound group). (Values exceeding 200% of global\nmean: Spain (blood lipid regulators 441%, other cardiovascular drugs\n213%, painkillers 209%), Germany (antidepressants 246%), South Korea\n(other cardiovascular drugs 404%)). The top 20 most frequently studied compounds in\nEurope included\n8 painkillers, 6 cardiovascular drugs, and 4 antibiotics with median\nconcentrations for all compounds below 100 ng L–1 except aspirin and paracetamol (median approximately 190 ng L–1; Figure 6). A similar picture\nwas evident in North America and Asia with mostly antibiotics, cardiovascular\ndrugs, and painkillers present in the top 20 and median concentrations\ngenerally <100 ng L–1. A small number of compounds\n(6 in Europe and Asia and 2 in North America) had maxima >10 000\nng L–1. Of particular note was the antiepileptic\ndrug carbamazepine which was the most frequently studied and detected\ncompound in both North America and Europe and third in Asia. The minimum\ndetection frequency for compounds displayed in Figure 6 was 9% (diclofenac in North America) but average detections\nfrequencies were 70% (Europe), 27% (North America), and 65% (Asia).

A major finding from this analysis was that 45%\nof European and\nAsian and 23% of North America studies failed to provide any details\nof the sampling regime and techniques adopted (Figure 7). Isolated and nonrepeated grab sampling was by far the most\ncommon technique adopted in 31–34% of studies. Slightly more\nrepresentative repeated grab sampling over periods ranging from days\nto years was adopted in just 12% of studies. Additional techniques\nare available including composite sampling and the use of passive\nsamplers (e.g., polar organic contaminant integrative sampling, POCIS)\nwhich give an integrated sample over a period of days to weeks. However,\nthese were adopted by just 11% of European and 9% of North American\nstudies and not at all elsewhere.

Chronic effects data for the six main compound\nclasses were collated\nfrom four major reviews17,20,21,177 and any duplicate results were\nremoved manually. Chronic data (rather than acute) was chosen as these\nwere deemed to be more representative of actual long-term, low-level\nexposure of aquatic organisms;178 the end\npoints assessed included lethal and sublethal indices (e.g., feeding,\ngrowth, behavior, and reproduction). The data included here are not\nintended as a direct assessment of particular compound toxicity but\nrather to highlight where overlaps between measured environmental\nconcentrations and chronic toxicity indicate potential environmental\nrisk. The ranges of chronic toxicity vary markedly across compound\ntypes\nand taxa (Figure 8). From these data antidepressants\nappear to pose particular risk to all taxa except bacteria with effective\nconcentrations ranging from μg to mg L–1.\nInvertebrates and fish show chronic toxic effects at sub mg L–1 levels for cardiovascular drugs and Others; fish\nalso appear susceptible to painkillers with median effects manifesting\nat 40 μg L–1. This summary highlights where\nresearch is lacking; in particular there were no studies examining\nthe effects of antibiotics on fish, antidepressants on aquatic plants,\nor cardiovascular drugs on bacteria. Overall, bacteria and aquatic\nplants appear to be the least well studied whereas research on chronic\neffects in aquatic invertebrates is relatively abundant.

The research\nthat has been undertaken displays a heavy bias toward North America,\nEurope, and the more populous parts of China. Given that the consumption\nof pharmaceuticals is ubiquitous across the globe,179 there is clearly a pressing need to expand research into\ntheir occurrence particularly in Russia, southern Asia, Africa, the\nMiddle East, South America, and eastern Europe. As more data becomes\navailable, the better able researchers will be to highlight the scale\nof the problem and inform management decisions. Moreover, even where\nstudies have been relatively numerous knowledge is still minimal compared\nto that for other stressors such as nutrients,180,181 acidification,182 river regulation,183 and sedimentation.184 When looking at the spread of research it is apparent that\nthe spatial biases manifest at multiple scales. In Europe, an obvious\ncluster of research is evident around central Europe particularly\nand to a lesser extent in the UK and Spain. Research effort appears\nto be clustered around the high population areas of e.g., London,\nParis, Hamburg, Frankfurt, California and the North American eastern\nseaboard, Beijing and Guangdong province in China. This is understandable\ngiven that pharmaceutical pollution can be expected to be at its greatest\nin densely populated areas, and a risk-based approach185 should target these receiving waters first. However, this\nleaves substantial proportions of Europe and North America with insufficient\nresearch. For example, in the UK no research has been conducted in\nthe major urban areas of the West Midlands, Greater Manchester, or\nWest Yorkshire which have a combined population of 6 million people.186 Researchers should expand monitoring efforts\nto previously unstudied catchments while at the same time increasing\nthe length/breadth and temporal resolution of monitoring campaigns\nif the dynamics of pharmaceutical pollution are to be fully understood.\nResearch in less densely populated and rural areas should also be\na priority as it is probable that STPs in such locations are smaller\nand less advanced when compared to their larger counterparts serving\nurban areas.187 When viewed globally,\nantibiotics, antiepileptics, cardiovascular drugs (including blood\nlipid regulators), and painkillers accounted for 86% of all database\nrecords with carbamazepine being the single most commonly identified\ncompound. A likely reason for this bias is that these drug types are\nthe most widely prescribed and purchased over-the-counter.188,189 For example, cardiovascular drugs and painkillers were among the\ntop three compound types prescribed to adults in the U.S. during 2007189 and as such could be expected to enter the\nenvironment in the highest concentrations. However, this leaves major\ngroups of potentially toxic pharmaceuticals being poorly studied.\nFor example, antidepressants, antivirals, cancer treatments, tranquilizers,\nand antifungals combined accounted for just 6.3% of records. A reason\nfor this imbalance in detections could be that researchers have not\nbeen analyzing these compounds in environmental samples, rather than\ntheir being genuinely scarce. It may also be possible that less frequently\ndetected compounds are less refractory and are more efficiently removed\nduring sewage treatment (e.g., (9)). Further studies on these “rarer” compounds\nare particularly necessary because some studies have shown effects\non microalgal communities even at very low environmental concentrations.190 Interestingly, antidepressants were the most\nwidely prescribed compounds among young American adults,189 and this is reflected in the relatively high\nnumber of North American studies analyzing these compounds (9%) when\ncompared to Asia and Europe (1%). The analysis confirmed that\nknowledge of some pharmaceutical groups is almost completely lacking,\nwith >50% of entries in the database represented by just 14 compounds\n(all of which are antibiotics, antiepileptics, cardiovascular drugs,\nor painkillers). The entire database represents only a snapshot (203)\nof all pharmaceuticals approved for use, which is estimated to be\nwell over 5000 in Europe alone.191 This\ngives a conservative estimate that fewer than 4% of pharmaceuticals\nhave been analyzed for and detected in freshwaters. It demonstrates\na clear need for future research to be expanded across the less well\nstudied compounds, particularly those identified as posing environmental\nrisk. One of\nthe most striking results from the data was the relatively high concentrations\nfor antibiotics and Others (comprising just the respiratory drug ceterizine\nand the contrast medium ioprimide in Asia) compared to other classes.\nHowever, these very high concentrations were skewed by a small number\nof studies which analyzed waters receiving pharmaceutical manufacturing\neffluent.29,30 Up until recently pharmaceutical manufacturing\nfacilities (PMFs) were considered a low priority given the high value\nof pharmaceutical products and the adoption of “good management\npractice” by the industry intended to reduce wastage and loss\nto the environment.192 However, several\nstudies have shown that PMFs can be a significant source of pharmaceuticals\nto receiving waters both within developed (e.g., (193)) and developing countries\n(e.g., refs (30, 194)); these\nshould be considered a priority for future research effort given the\npotential for strong localized effects. National means were\ncompared to global means to evaluate the appropriateness of local\nstudies as indicators of concentrations at larger spatial scales.\nThese comparisons highlight the importance of local studies to inform\nstakeholders and regulators, and emphasize a need for caution when\nscaling up to larger spatial scales, or vice versa. Given the relative\npaucity of data it is possible for a small number of studies at particularly\npolluted locations to have a disproportionate influence on national\nand even global mean concentrations. The very high concentrations\nfor antibiotics in Asia and globally are an example of this problem.\nThe global median antibiotic concentration (8135 ng L–1) reduces (58 ng L–1) if just two Chinese and Indian\nstudies are excluded.29,30 Ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole\nwere consistently within the top five studied compounds across all\nregions and had similar concentration ranges (1–10 000\nng L–1). Notably though, very high concentrations\n(up to a maximum of 10 000 000 ng L–1) of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin were\nevident in Asia; this is of concern because these are well within\nthe range known to cause acute and chronic toxic effects to aquatic\norganisms.20 Also of note was the presence\nof the antidepressant fluoxetine in the top 20 North American compounds;\nthis type of antidepressant causes chronic effects at the low ng L–1 range,195,196 well below the median\nand maximum concentrations detected in the environment. Carbamazepine\nis the single most widely studied and detected compound in Europe\nand North America but is not generally considered to pose a risk of\nacute or chronic toxicity to freshwater organisms (e.g., (197)). However, its refractory\nnature and generally ubiquitous presence in STP effluent may make\ncarbamazepine a useful source-specific tracer of domestic wastewater\ncontamination.198 Perhaps the most crucial step in\nreliably quantifying the presence of compounds such as pharmaceuticals\nin freshwaters is the collection of a representative sample using\nappropriate strategies and methodologies.199,200 Sampling uncertainty can often exceed that during the analytical\nprocedure.201 Large sample numbers and\nsophisticated analytical techniques, although important, should not\nbe seen as a substitute for the collection of a representative sample199 and a poor sampling can be the dominant source\nof error in water quality data.202 Some\nexponents of sampling theory have gone so far as to argue that “nothing\ngood (certainly nothing representative) has ever come from grab sampling”203 due to the fact they provide a mere snapshot\nin time. Grab sampling does have a part to play in furthering our\nunderstanding of pharmaceutical occurrence particularly for extensive\nspatial or long-term studies where the equipment and set-up costs\nof more representative techniques may be prohibitive. However, efforts\nshould be made to adopt more representative techniques wherever possible.\nFor pharmaceuticals in particular, non-repeated grab sampling is unlikely\nto be representative as sample concentrations have been shown to vary\nconsiderably over time.28 A possible\nexplanation for the lack of robust sampling is the relatively high\nproportion of studies published in journals with a focus on analytical\nchemistry (namely Journal of Chromatography A, Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, and Talanta). The main thrust of these journals is method development rather\nthan the collection of large, representative data sets and this is\nborne out by the fact that 64% of these papers did not state the sampling\nmethodologies adopted (c.f. 44% across all journals) and only 11%\nof studies adopted repeated grab or composite sampling strategies\n(c.f. 21–23% across all journals). This propensity of analytical\nstudies to collect fewer samples for shorter periods is probably due\nto analytical chemists needing to validate methods on “real”\nsamples which require only minimal numbers to achieve. The contribution\nof these papers should not be understated though, as they provide\nreliable and sophisticated analytical methods that can be adopted\nas part of more representative sampling studies. The occurrence data\nalone provided by these studies covers 94 compounds in 34 countries,\nso minor modifications to sampling strategies and subsequent reporting\nby these scientists could benefit the field substantially. In\naddition to the techniques adopted, appropriate sampling numbers,\nduration, and frequency are crucial to obtain a reliable quantification\nof variable water quality parameters. Most studies collected a relatively\nsmall number of samples (1–50) with only 13% of studies collecting\nfor >12 months. This indicates a dearth of long-term monitoring\nwhich\nmay be crucial in understanding seasonal and annual dynamics. Conversely,\nsampling at an appropriately high temporal resolution over the short-term\nis equally important if we are to fully quantify variability over\nthe periods of minutes to days (e.g., refs (28, 199, 200)). Studies\non other aquatic contaminants have shown the importance of a robust\nsampling strategy; Rabiet et al.205 demonstrated\nthat fixed time interval grab sampling underestimated pesticide fluxes\nfrom a small catchment by as much as a factor of 5. Robertson206 recommended tailoring sampling strategies to\nthe variable of interest and the duration of the study when monitoring\nin small streams. An interesting research question would be the systematic\ncomparison of measured concentrations between grab sampling and continuous\nor composite techniques; the database assembled here may prove useful\nin such a study. These data clearly highlight the importance\nof adopting flexible,\nappropriate sampling strategies in order to supply reliable and representative\ndata. Furthermore, researchers should explicitly state the techniques\nemployed in addition to sample numbers, frequencies, and locations\nso that other researchers can fairly evaluate the results presented\nand use them to inform their own research. Despite the widespread presence of many pharmaceuticals in freshwaters,\nsome risk assessments have suggested that they pose little risk of\nacute or chronic toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations.17,207 The data summaries presented here and elsewhere indicate potential\noverlap between chronic effects levels and the concentrations detected\nwithin freshwaters. In particular, potential risks are evident for\ninvertebrates and fish from antibiotics and cardiovascular drugs in\nAsia and from the contrast media, tranquilizers, and antiepileptics\n(carbamazepine) across all regions. Additionally, invertebrates and\nfish are potentially at risk (i.e., low margin of safety) from antidepressants\nand painkillers in North America. While this may suggest that future\nresearch should shift toward less well studied but more “toxic”\ncompounds, particular care needs to be taken with these conclusions\nbecause many effects studies on aquatic “ecosystems”\nhave been undertaken using ecologically unrealistic (i.e., single\nspecies) laboratory experiments. Additionally, such studies tend to\ntest at concentrations that are orders of magnitude above those detected\nin the environment and be run over short time-scales, and as such\ndo not adequately address the issue of low-level, chronic exposure.\nStudies which have examined the effects of low-level pharmaceutical\nexposure on aquatic ecosystem structure and functioning are rare but\nhave indicated that pharmaceuticals can display significant effects\non important ecosystem services.208−211 The data presented here\nare a useful indicator of particular compound classes exhibiting some\nkind of toxic effect at the levels stated. As such, the combined occurrence\nand effects data sets can serve as a guide for future ecotoxicological\nresearch. However, they should be treated with caution as they integrate\na variety of toxicological tests which employ a range of exposures\nand end points across a variety of species. The exposure regime of\nany testing should attempt to cover both the median as a measure of\nfrequently encountered concentrations, and the maximum concentration\nas an indicator of worst-case exposure. Furthermore, standard assessments\nof toxicity, while useful in producing comparable results, suffer\nfrom low bio-complexity and environmental relevance, so researchers\nneed to adopt a more flexible, knowledge-based approach tailored to\nspecific risks.212 A problem with undertaking\nresearch in “natural” freshwaters is that there will\nprobably be myriad other compounds in addition to the one of interest,\nmeaning a high potential for confounding effects. More realistic controlled\nexperiments need to be designed and undertaken (e.g., (213)) before researchers can\nmake better predictions about ecosystem response to pharmaceutical\npollution. Researchers and regulators must therefore be wary of dismissing\nparticular pharmaceuticals as “low risk” on the basis\nof isolated and overly simplified laboratory studies.\n\n## Spatial Distribution of Research\nThis study shows that\nknowledge of pharmaceutical occurrence is poor or absent for large\nparts of the globe, particularly in developing countries.

In doing so\nit has highlighted large parts of the globe where knowledge of pharmaceutical\noccurrence is minimal or nonexistent. In particular, large parts of\nAsia, Africa, South America, and Australia should be seen as a priority\nfor future research. Additionally, the majority of countries where\nresearch is sparse or absent are developing nations, and as such it\nis possible that the pharmaceutical consumption (and hence pollution)\nprofile may differ markedly from that of developed nations. It may\nbe the case that in developing countries water resource management\nhas not yet progressed to the stage where environmental monitoring\nand regulation of pollutants typically start to be taken seriously.214 Even within the developed nations of\nEurope and North America there\nis a pressing need for better spatial coverage across all provinces\nand states. Future research should learn lessons from other fields\nand use appropriate, representative sampling strategies to give much\nmore reliable estimates of the pollution problem. The current proposal\nfor statutory monitoring of diclofenac in European waters26 will provide a substantial boost to our knowledge\nbut researchers and regulators should also see this as an opportunity\nto increase our understanding of the thousands of other pharmaceuticals\nand domestic chemicals that routinely enter freshwaters via STPs. The most striking results of this study were the very high concentrations\nreported (particularly antibiotics, painkillers, and antidepressants)\nthat are within the range known to cause acute or chronic toxicity\nin aquatic systems. This challenges the assumption that pharmaceuticals\nin rivers generally pose little risk28 and\nhighlights the need for an expansion of robust monitoring and the\nadoption of more realistic ecotoxicological experiments. Expanding\nresearch effort to previously understudied compounds (some antibiotics,\nantidepressants, respiratory drugs, and contrast media) and areas\nof the globe where research coverage is poor should be a priority.\nThis is particularly important as in coming decades it is anticipated\nthat pharmaceutical use will increase substantially, partly due to\nthe aging population structure in developed countries, and with ongoing\nincreases in the standard of living in developing countries. These\nimprovements in quality of life are accompanied by an increase in\nmeat consumption in developing countries215 which in turn may boost the consumption of veterinary pharmaceuticals\nposing additional environmental risk. The database assembled\nin this study should serve as a useful tool\nfor industry professionals, academics, regulators, and water managers\nin prioritizing future work on both pharmaceutical occurrence and\nthe effects of such compounds on aquatic ecosystems. Ultimately, the\nresults indicate that despite almost two decades of research effort,\nour knowledge of pharmaceutical occurrence and effects in the environment\nis still substantially lacking when compared to that of other aquatic\npollutants.",
