  "abstract": "Nongenotoxic (NGTX) carcinogens induce cancer via other\nmechanisms\nthan direct DNA damage. A recognized mode of action for NGTX carcinogens\nis induction of oxidative stress, a state in which the amount of oxidants\nin a cell exceeds its antioxidant capacity, leading to regenerative\nproliferation. Currently, carcinogenicity assessment of environmental\nchemicals primarily relies on genetic toxicity end points. Since NGTX\ncarcinogens lack genotoxic potential, these chemicals may remain undetected\nin such evaluations. To enhance the predictivity of test strategies\nfor carcinogenicity assessment, a shift toward mechanism-based approaches\nis required. Here, we present an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network\nfor chemically induced oxidative stress leading to (NGTX) carcinogenesis.\nTo develop this AOP network, we first investigated the role of oxidative\nstress in the various cancer hallmarks. Next, possible mechanisms\nfor chemical induction of oxidative stress and the biological effects\nof oxidative damage to macromolecules were considered. This resulted\nin an AOP network, of which associated uncertainties were explored.\nUltimately, development of AOP networks relevant for carcinogenesis\nin humans will aid the transition to a mechanism-based, human relevant\ncarcinogenicity assessment that involves a substantially lower number\nof laboratory animals.",

      "text": "Carcinogenesis is a multistep process\nin which normal cells transform\ninto cancer cells by acquiring various, biologically diverse characteristics\nreferred to as cancer hallmarks. 1 − 3  At present, the International\nAgency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified 534 chemical compounds\nas proven human carcinogen (IARC 1), probable human carcinogen (IARC\n2A) or possible human carcinogen (IARC 2B). 4  These chemical carcinogens can induce tumor formation either through\ngenotoxic (GTX) or nongenotoxic (NGTX) mechanisms. 5  Compounds able to directly damage or interact with DNA\nare generally classified as GTX carcinogens, whereas NGTX carcinogens\ndo not directly interact with DNA nor the cellular apparatus involved\nin preserving genomic integrity. 6  Instead,\nNGTX carcinogens induce carcinogenesis via mechanisms including receptor\nactivation, chronic inflammation, immune suppression, endocrine disruption,\nepigenetic silencing or oxidative stress. 2 , 7 , 8  Both GTX and NGTX mechanisms of carcinogenesis\neventually involve the cancer hallmarks of genomic instability, loss\nof proliferative control and resistance to cell death. 5  Despite a wide spectrum of modes of action (MoAs) for NGTX\ncarcinogens, increased cell proliferation is shown to be a fundamental\nkey event (KE). 7 , 9  Receptor activation, sustained\ncytotoxicity, altered signal transduction, immunosuppression and induction\nof oxidative stress can all contribute to stimulation of cell proliferation. 1 , 7  Contrary to GTX carcinogens, NGTX carcinogens are hypothesized to\ninduce tumorigenesis through repeated or sustained exposure resulting\nin prolonged perturbation or modulation of physiological processes. 10 , 11\n\nOxidative stress leading to regenerative proliferation is\na MoA\nrelevant for carcinogenesis. 12 − 16  Upon an imbalance between the generation of oxidants, such as reactive\noxygen species (ROS), and their scavenging by antioxidants, oxidative\nstress is induced. 17  This imbalance can\narise from exposure to either endogenous or exogenous sources responsible\nfor oxidant generation or from depletion of antioxidants. 13  Oxidative stress is known to promote carcinogenesis\nthrough both DNA damage and impaired repair and through indirect actions\ninfluencing homeostasis and signaling. 18  Additionally, ROS play a role in numerous stages of the multistep\ncarcinogenic process. 19 , 20\n\nTraditionally, cancer hazard\nassessment requires long-term carcinogenicity\nstudies (OECD Test Guidelines 451 21 /453 22 ). There is a strong need for alternative approaches\nbecause rodent studies show limited translatability to man, 23  raise ethical concerns, have questionable reproducibility 7 , 24  and are time- and cost consuming. 23  Currently,\ncancer hazard assessment predominantly relies on genetic toxicity\nend points, since genetic damage is considered to be key to carcinogenicity. 25  While there is evidence of a GTX MoA for most\nof the substances classified by IARC, approximately 9% of these substances\nlack a GTX potential based on data from a battery of  in vitro  and  in vivo  genotoxicity tests, 8  indicating that NGTX carcinogens may remain undetected\nin such evaluations since these act via other mechanism than direct\ngenetic damage. Therefore, to enhance the prediction of carcinogenic\npotential of substances, transitioning toward a mechanism-based approach\nis deemed necessary. 7 , 25 − 28  To aid this transition, adverse\noutcome pathways (AOPs) could serve as a framework to select appropriate\nnew approach methodologies (NAMs) and identify research gaps.\n\nIn this article, an AOP network for chemically induced oxidative\nstress leading to (NGTX) carcinogenesis is proposed. We start with\nsummarizing the main findings concerning the role of oxidative stress\nin the cancer hallmarks and its relation to cancer in both animals\nand humans. Next, possible mechanisms for chemical induction of oxidative\nstress are considered. The relation between oxidative stress and the\ncancer hallmarks is further explored by discussing the biological\neffects of oxidative damage to macromolecules. Ultimately, we integrate\nthis information into an AOP network that can contribute to the development\nof an integrated approach to the testing and assessment (IATA) for\nsuspected (NGTX) carcinogens inducing oxidative stress. Given the\nbreadth of literature on oxidative stress as well as carcinogenesis,\nwe considered it necessary to demarcate the scope of this paper. This\nreview focuses on the role of ROS, whereas the role of reactive nitrogen\nspecies in oxidative stress and carcinogenesis is considered beyond\nthe scope of this paper. Additionally, although we are well aware\nof the interrelation between oxidative stress and inflammation, we\ndeliberately describe the discussed processes from an oxidative stress\nperspective."

      "title": "Oxidative Stress in Relation to the Cancer Hallmarks",
      "text": "During the process of carcinogenesis cells acquire certain characteristics\nreferred to as cancer hallmarks. 1 , 2  These hallmarks rationalize\nthe complex biological processes involved in tumor formation. 2 , 29 , 30  In a well-known review, Hanahan\nand Weinberg proposed the following six hallmarks: (1) ‘sustaining\nproliferative signaling’, (2) ‘evading growth suppression’,\n(3) ‘enabling replicative immortality’, (4) “inducing\nangiogenesis”, (5) “resisting cell death”, and\n(6) ‘activating invasion and metastasis’. 1  Later, two emerging hallmarks and two enabling\ncharacteristics were added: ‘avoiding immune destruction’,\n‘deregulating cellular energetics’, ‘genome instability\nand mutation’, and ‘tumor-promoting inflammation’. 2  Since then, novel insights into carcinogenesis\nhave led to occasional reconsideration of the cancer hallmarks 3 , 29 , 30  ( Figure  1 ).\n\nHallmarks of cancer. The 10 hallmarks of cancer\nas described by\nHanahan and Weinberg, 2  supplemented with\nnovel insights into carcinogenesis. 3 , 29 , 30  Translucent hallmarks are not discussed in this paper.\nThe inner circle schematically represents the signaling networks that\nconnect the hallmarks and the tumor microenvironment.\n\nA vast number of studies have described the relationship\nbetween\noxidative stress and carcinogenesis. 13 , 16 , 18 − 20 , 31 − 33  Generally, low concentrations of ROS are involved\nin regular biological processes such as transcriptional regulation,\ndifferentiation and proliferation, whereas high levels of ROS exceed\nthe antioxidant defense system, consequently inducing oxidative stress. 34  Carcinogenesis may occur when ROS exceed physiological\nlevels sustainably while avoiding excessive cell death. 20  ROS can induce tumor formation either through\nGTX or NGTX mechanisms. 13  Genotoxicity\noccurs when ROS interact with DNA and the resulting oxidative DNA\ndamage is not repaired prior to DNA replication. Alternatively, ROS\ncan modulate expression of genes and proteins, such as growth factors\nand proto-oncogenes, which play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis,\nwithout inflicting direct DNA damage. 13 , 18\n\nSince\nthe focus of this review is on NGTX carcinogenesis by chemical\ninduction of oxidative stress, the cancer hallmarks ‘activating\ninvasion and metastasis’ and ‘inducing angiogenesis’\nwill not be discussed. These hallmarks are considered late events\nin carcinogenesis, making it virtually impossible to distinguish chemically\ninduced oxidative stress from tumor-induced oxidative stress, thereby\nlowering its predictive value for human health protection and relevance\nfor chemical hazard assessment. 7  For the\ncancer hallmarks ‘enabling replicative immortality’\nand ‘deregulating cellular energetics’, we were unable\nto find sufficiently substantial, biologically relevant evidence for\ntheir relation with chemical induction of oxidative stress. Hence,\nthe focus of this review is on the relationship between oxidative\nstress and the cancer hallmarks ‘maintaining proliferative\ncapacity’ (fusion of sustaining proliferative signaling and\nevading growth suppression), ‘resisting cell death’,\n‘immune modulation’ (merger of avoiding immune destruction\nand tumor-promoting inflammation), and ‘genome instability\nand epigenetic dysregulation’, excluding direct GTX effects.\n\nCancer cells are\nknown for their ability to maintain proliferation. 2  One mechanism through which ROS are involved in sustaining\nproliferative signaling is through oxidation of phosphatases and subsequent\nactivation of signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation. 13 , 32 , 35  To illustrate, ROS can oxidize\nand subsequently inhibit phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN),\nleading to activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein\nkinase B (Akt) signaling. 36 , 37  Alternatively, PI3K/Akt\nsignaling activation can be mediated by oxidation of protein tyrosine\nphosphatase 1B (PTP1B). 38  Similarly, oxidation\nof mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP) leads\nto activation of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)\nsignaling. 39 , 40  MAPK/ERK signaling can be triggered\nthrough ROS-dependent intracellular calcium release and subsequent\nactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) as well. 41  Notably, induction of oxidative stress can both activate and repress\nnuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of B cells (NF-κB)\nsignaling. 35 , 42  Inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB)\noxidation results in dissociation, allowing nuclear translocation\nof NF-κB, 43  whereas oxidation of\nIκB kinase (IKK) prevents IκB degradation and subsequent\nNF-κB nuclear translocation. 44 , 45\n\nAlternatively,\ncell proliferation can be maintained through activation of activator\nprotein 1 (AP-1). Upon oxidation of thioredoxin (TRX), apoptosis signal-regulating\nkinase 1 (ASK1) activity is no longer inhibited, allowing c-Jun N-terminal\nkinase (JNK) proteins to translocate to the nucleus for induction\nof AP-1. 46 , 47  Activation of AP-1 induces expression of\ngrowth-stimulatory genes and suppresses cell cycle inhibitors. 13 , 48  Lastly, in response to oxidative modification of Kelch like ECH\nassociated protein 1 (KEAP1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor\n2 (NRF2) is activated and subsequent translocation to the nucleus\nleads to expression of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., Ki67\nand NOTCH1). 49 , 50\n\nThe normal balance between proliferation\nand cell death is disturbed in cancer cells. 29  ROS can disrupt this equilibrium either through inhibition of pro-apoptotic\nfactors or through induction of antiapoptotic factors, ultimately\nmediating resistance to cell death. For example, ROS can activate\nthe Akt pathway through oxidation of PTEN, 36 , 37  which may lead to increased cell survival via phosphorylation and\nconsequent inactivation of pro-apoptotic factors such as B-cell lymphoma\n(Bcl)-2-associated agonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X\nprotein (Bax), and Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). 33 , 51 , 52  Additionally, oxidative stress\ncan activate MAPK/p38, 53  NF-κB 43  and NRF2 50  signaling,\nresulting in reduced caspase activity. Moreover, NRF2 activation can\nreduce the release of cytochrome- c  from mitochondria,\npreventing apoptosis through inhibition of apoptosome formation. 54 , 55  Alternatively, ROS can induce expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2\nfamily members by means of NRF2, 54 , 55  NF-κB,\nand signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 (STAT3/5)\nsignaling. 56\n\nAccording to immune surveillance\ntheory, cells are continually monitored by the body’s immune\nsystem and eliminated upon becoming cancerous. 2  Following this principle, existing tumors have arisen from cells\nthat somehow managed to avoid detection and elimination by the immune\nsystem. Oxidative stress can mediate avoidance of immune destruction\nin three ways. First, oxidative stress can induce the formation of\nregulatory T-cells and strengthen their immunosuppressive potency. 57  Second, by inhibiting the interaction between\nthe T-cell receptor and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide\ncomplex, ROS can functionally impair cytotoxic T-cells, which play\na pivotal role in immune destruction of cancer cells. 58  Lastly, tumor-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells\n(MDSCs) can inhibit T-cell proliferation in a ROS-dependent manner. 59\n\nContrarily, oxidative stress is also involved\nin creating a tumor-promoting inflammatory microenvironment. The abundance\nof ROS can trigger pro-oncogenic signaling pathways, for example,\nNF-κB, 43  MAPK, 40  and STAT3, 56  which in turn can\ncontribute to the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as\ntumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and\nIL-6. 56 , 60  Consecutively, these pro-inflammatory mediators\ncan stimulate both ROS production 61  and\npro-oncogenic signaling pathways involved in proliferation, angiogenesis,\ninvasion, and resistance to apoptosis. 62\n\nBesides\ndirect induction of mutations as a result of oxidative DNA damage,\noxidative stress can contribute to genome instability and epigenetic\ndysregulation. Repetitive sequences, which are particularly susceptible\nto DNA oxidation, can form secondary DNA structures upon oxidation. 63  During DNA replication, recruitment of a special\nbut error-prone DNA polymerase to these secondary DNA structures is\nneeded for continuation of synthesis, ultimately contributing to genome\ninstability. 63  Furthermore, ROS-induced\nexpression of Bcl-2, following NRF2, 54 , 55  NF-κB,\nor STAT3/5 signaling, 56  can inhibit DNA\ndouble-strand break (DSB) repair. 64  Lastly,\nROS-induced inflammation can cause both microsatellite and chromosomal\ninstability via dysregulation of DNA repair enzymes, defective mitotic\ncheckpoints, induction of DSBs, and dysregulated homologous recombination\n(reviewed in ref ( 65 )).\n\nAlternatively, ROS can cause alterations in the DNA methylation\nstatus through interaction with DNA and proteins. 15  As a result of DNA oxidation, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine\n(8-OHdG) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) may be formed. 66 , 67  Consequently, DNA binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBPs),\nepigenetic regulators responsible for DNA methyl transferase (DNMT)\nand histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruitment can be inhibited and these\nDNA regions might therefore get hypomethylated. 66 , 67  Most demethylated regions are promoters belonging to oncogenes,\nwhich consequently can be activated. 15 , 68 , 69  Additionally, methylation of repetitive and transposable\nelements is often lost in cancer, which can result in random integration\nof these elements into the genome and subsequently cause genetic instability. 15 , 70  On the other hand, ROS can also mediate hypermethylation and subsequent\nloss of tumor suppressor promoter regions through upregulation and\nrecruitment of DNMT and HDAC, a phenomenon frequently observed in\nhuman cancers. 15 , 71  For example, hypermethylation\nof the human mutL homologue 1 (hMLH1) promoter region diminishes its\nexpression, 72  which is related to repressed\nactivity of the mismatch repair system. 73"

      "title": "Oxidative Stress in Cancer",
      "text": "Oxidative stress leading\nto regenerative proliferation is one of\nthe best documented mechanisms for carcinogenesis. 12 − 15  About half of the IARC 1 classified\nsubstances (35 out of 86) were shown to have the ability to induce\noxidative stress. 74  Notably, chronic inflammation,\nassociated with ROS formation and altered signaling, has become a\nwell-recognized risk factor for various human cancers. 14 , 62  Evidence for the role of oxidative stress in carcinogenesis can\nbe found in both animals and humans.\n\nClear evidence for oxidative\nstress leading to regenerative proliferation as a carcinogenic MoA\nin animals was derived from rodent knockout studies. Loss of antioxidant\ngenes, such as superoxide dismutase 1 ( Sod1 ), 75 , 76  peroxiredoxin 1 ( Prdx1 ) 77 , 78  and glutathione peroxidase ( Gpx ), 79  was shown to predispose mice to oxidative DNA damage and\ncarcinogenesis. Moreover, contrary to wildtype mice, mice with a knockout\nof cytochrome P450 2E1 ( Cyp2e1 ; a known electron\nleaker during xenobiotic metabolism) were shown to not manifest hepatotoxicity\nnor regenerative proliferation upon exposure to chloroform. 80  In another study,  Cyp2e1 -null\nmice showed no oxidative damage phenotype whereas wildtype and humanized  Cyp2e1  mice did. 81  Furthermore,\nimpaired liver regeneration has been observed in rodents lacking either\nAP-1 (c-Jun monomer) or NF-κB, both are essential transcription\nfactors for hepatic regenerative proliferation. 82 , 83  Inhibition of IL-1α 84  or hematopoietic\ndepletion of inhibitor of NF-κB kinase β ( Ikkβ ) 85  in mice resulted in decreased regenerative\nproliferation. Lastly,  Jnk1  knockout mice showed\nimpaired cellular proliferation and subsequent decreased liver carcinogenesis. 86\n\nIn a project by the European Partnership\nfor Alternative Approaches to animal testing (EPAA), 170 NGTX carcinogenic\nagrochemicals were evaluated, with the aim to assess the tumor types\ninduced and organs affected and to identify the various MoAs underlying\nthe carcinogenic potential. 10  Mechanistic\ninformation collected on the NGTX carcinogens resulted in a list of\nnine MoAs, including sustained cytotoxicity leading to regenerative\nproliferation. Of the 96 substances for which a MoA could be established,\n49 (51%) were presumed to induce sustained cytotoxicity. This MoA\nhas been observed for tumors in the liver, kidney, stomach, bladder,\nand intestine. 10  Induction of oxidative\nstress is a central event within the MoA sustained cytotoxicity. 87  However, only for four of the 49 substances,\ninduction of oxidative stress was explicitly mentioned. 10  Together these four substances induced seven\nunique treatment-related tumors affecting the liver, spleen and lymphoid\nsystem. 10\n\nEvidence for the role of\noxidative stress in carcinogenesis in humans mainly comes from epidemiological\nstudies. Increased risk of cancer of the liver, kidney, blood, immune\nsystem, bladder and gastrointestinal tract has been reported in humans\nafter exposure to carcinogens known to operate via oxidative stress\nin animals. 88 − 96  For instance, GTX carcinogens (pharmaceuticals) that induce oxidative\nDNA damage, such as cyclophosphamide, etoposide, tamoxifen and azathioprine, 97 , 98  have epidemiologically been linked to elevated cancer risk. 89  Epidemiological evidence for NGTX carcinogens\noperating via oxidative stress exist as well; a few examples are described\nhere. In a large cohort study of 23,829 sawmill workers in British\nColumbia, substantial evidence of an association between pentachlorophenol\nexposure and the incidence of liver cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and\nmultiple myeloma was found. 90  Additionally,\noccupational exposure to pentachlorophenol might elevate the risk\nof hematopoietic, 99  neurological and digestive\ntract cancer. 100  Evidence for oxidative\nstress induction following pentachlorophenol exposure has been found\nboth in cells with a human origin and in mice. 101 , 102  Another example is exposure to trichloroethylene, for which an epidemiological\nlink to increased risk of kidney cancer, 88 , 92 − 95  non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 92 , 94 , 103  and liver cancer 94 , 96  has been found. Trichloroethylene\nhas been shown to induce oxidative stress in a human hepatic cell\nline 104  and in rats. 105  Moreover, in a prospective cohort of pesticide applicators,\nan association between thyroid cancer and lindane exposure was observed. 106  Agricultural use of lindane also has been associated\nwith an elevated risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 107 , 108  In rats, lindane exposure was shown to induce oxidative stress. 109\n\nAnother line of evidence for human relevance\nderives from genetic variation in oxidative-stress related genes and\ncancer susceptibility in the human population. 18  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in antioxidant enzymes\nSOD and catalase (CAT) have been linked to increased cancer incidence\nand susceptibility. 110  Moreover, SNPs altering\nthe function of AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1) and 8-oxo-guanine DNA glycosylase\n(OGG1), DNA repair genes primarily involved in base excision repair\nof oxidative DNA damage, 18  have been linked\nto increased cancer risk in humans. 111 − 113\n\nNext to this,\nbiomarkers of oxidative stress can be found in cancer\npatients as well, though it should be noted that these are not indicative\nof a role for oxidative stress in tumor initiation. Increased total\noxidant, decreased total antioxidant, 114 − 119  elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) 114 , 116 , 120 , 121  and increased protein\ncarbonyl serum levels 117 − 119 , 122  are found\nin cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, the catalogue\nof somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) has identified a mutational\nsignature (SBS18) in human cancers which is associated with oxidative\nDNA damage. 123  Finally, 8-OHdG, a biomarker\nfor oxidative DNA damage, can be quantified in biopsies and urinary\nsamples from cancer patients. 8-OHdG levels were found to be significantly\nincreased in chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC) compared to chronic hepatitis C patients without HCC. 124  Both 8-OHdG and NRF2 expressions were found\nto be significantly elevated in cancerous tissue compared to noncancerous\ntissue of HCC patients. 125  Again, these\nbiomarkers are indicative of oxidative stress in the cancer patient\nwhich is more likely the consequence rather than the cause of the\ntumor."

Increased risk of cancer of the liver, kidney, blood, immune\nsystem, bladder and gastrointestinal tract has been reported in humans\nafter exposure to carcinogens known to operate via oxidative stress\nin animals. 88 − 96  For instance, GTX carcinogens (pharmaceuticals) that induce oxidative\nDNA damage, such as cyclophosphamide, etoposide, tamoxifen and azathioprine, 97 , 98  have epidemiologically been linked to elevated cancer risk. 89  Epidemiological evidence for NGTX carcinogens\noperating via oxidative stress exist as well; a few examples are described\nhere. In a large cohort study of 23,829 sawmill workers in British\nColumbia, substantial evidence of an association between pentachlorophenol\nexposure and the incidence of liver cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and\nmultiple myeloma was found. 90  Additionally,\noccupational exposure to pentachlorophenol might elevate the risk\nof hematopoietic, 99  neurological and digestive\ntract cancer. 100  Evidence for oxidative\nstress induction following pentachlorophenol exposure has been found\nboth in cells with a human origin and in mice. 101 , 102  Another example is exposure to trichloroethylene, for which an epidemiological\nlink to increased risk of kidney cancer, 88 , 92 − 95  non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 92 , 94 , 103  and liver cancer 94 , 96  has been found. Trichloroethylene\nhas been shown to induce oxidative stress in a human hepatic cell\nline 104  and in rats. 105  Moreover, in a prospective cohort of pesticide applicators,\nan association between thyroid cancer and lindane exposure was observed. 106  Agricultural use of lindane also has been associated\nwith an elevated risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 107 , 108  In rats, lindane exposure was shown to induce oxidative stress. 109\n\nAnother line of evidence for human relevance\nderives from genetic variation in oxidative-stress related genes and\ncancer susceptibility in the human population. 18  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in antioxidant enzymes\nSOD and catalase (CAT) have been linked to increased cancer incidence\nand susceptibility. 110  Moreover, SNPs altering\nthe function of AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1) and 8-oxo-guanine DNA glycosylase\n(OGG1), DNA repair genes primarily involved in base excision repair\nof oxidative DNA damage, 18  have been linked\nto increased cancer risk in humans. 111 − 113\n\nNext to this,\nbiomarkers of oxidative stress can be found in cancer\npatients as well, though it should be noted that these are not indicative\nof a role for oxidative stress in tumor initiation. Increased total\noxidant, decreased total antioxidant, 114 − 119  elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) 114 , 116 , 120 , 121  and increased protein\ncarbonyl serum levels 117 − 119 , 122  are found\nin cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, the catalogue\nof somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) has identified a mutational\nsignature (SBS18) in human cancers which is associated with oxidative\nDNA damage. 123  Finally, 8-OHdG, a biomarker\nfor oxidative DNA damage, can be quantified in biopsies and urinary\nsamples from cancer patients. 8-OHdG levels were found to be significantly\nincreased in chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC) compared to chronic hepatitis C patients without HCC. 124  Both 8-OHdG and NRF2 expressions were found\nto be significantly elevated in cancerous tissue compared to noncancerous\ntissue of HCC patients. 125  Again, these\nbiomarkers are indicative of oxidative stress in the cancer patient\nwhich is more likely the consequence rather than the cause of the\ntumor."

Notably, this is an outline AOP network that requires further\ndevelopment especially a detailed description of the KEs and key event\nrelationships (KERs). A preliminary weight of evidence (WoE) evaluation\nwas performed ( Table S1A–D ) according\nto OECD guidance. 157  Adjacent KERs were\nassessed for both biological plausibility ( Table S1A ) and empirical evidence including consideration of contradictions\n( Table S1C ), while KEs were assessed for\nessentiality ( Table S1B ). For this, we\nrelied on the WoE assessments available in the AOP-Wiki ( aopwiki.org ) as well as scientific\nliterature. Details are given in  Tables S1A–D , with  Table S1D  providing a summary of\nthe WoE for each of the adjacent KERs. Overall, the biological plausibility\nfor the direct relationships in this AOP network is fairly strong.\nEvidence from empirical studies partly supports this assessment, but\nfor some KERs the number of published studies appeared to be limited.\nThe essentiality of the KEs in the AOP network, which can be demonstrated\nby modulating one KE and observing concordance in the downstream KEs,\nwas considered as moderate. Based on this, we consider the overall\nWoE of the AOP network moderate to strong: certain branches are very\ndata rich, providing strong evidence, whereas other branches require\nmore data to be generated. Additionally, to further examine this AOP\nnetwork, a noncomprehensive list of possible assays for KEs and reference\nchemicals for these assays is provided in  Table S2 .\n\nProposed network of AOPs for chemically induced oxidative stress\nleading to carcinogenesis. Chronic or prolonged activation of the\nmolecular initiating event and subsequent key events is required for\nthis AOP network to trigger the adverse outcome. Molecular initiating\nevents are depicted in green, cellular effects in orange, tissue effects\nin bright red and the adverse outcome in dark red. Cancer hallmarks\nare depicted in bold. Italicized text represent associated signaling\npathways. Examples of cytochrome P450 enzymes, oxidases and key proteins\nin protein oxidation are given in parentheses.\n\nThe AOP network consists of five molecular initiating\nevents (MIEs),\nnamely activation of specific CYPs, inhibition of mitochondrial complexes,\nimpacting on cellular antioxidant capacity, sustained AhR activation,\nand oxidase activation, which may all lead to oxidative stress. Following\nthe central KE oxidative stress, three parallel KEs can be induced:\nlipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and oxidative DNA damage. Sufficient\nactivation of these KEs can result in ER stress, altered cell survival,\nand/or genomic instability. Altered cell survival can result in tumor\npromoting inflammation, which in turn can lead to sustained or regenerative\nproliferation. Moreover, both genomic instability and altered cell\nsurvival can also result in regenerative or sustained proliferation.\nSufficient and persistent activation of this KE can lead to tumor\nformation. Notably, both sustained or regenerative proliferation and\nmutations are pivotal in carcinogenesis, and their relationships to\ncarcinogenesis are interlaced. Importantly, chronic or prolonged activation\nof the MIEs and subsequent KEs is necessary to trigger cancer."

      "text": "In the preceding sections,\nwe reported evidence for the role of\noxidative stress in carcinogenesis along the lines of the cancer hallmarks.\nWe summarized the main findings concerning the role of oxidative stress\nin cancer in both animals and humans. Lastly, we described how chemicals\ncan induce oxidative stress, and how oxidative stress to macromolecules\nrelates to cell death, ER stress, inflammation, proliferation, and\ngenomic instability. Our efforts have led to the development of an\nAOP network for chemically induced oxidative stress leading to carcinogenesis\n( Figure  3 ), which can\nbe used to guide the development of an IATA for suspected NGTX carcinogens\ninducing oxidative stress. Notably, many other mechanism relevant\nfor tumorigenesis exist. These were considered beyond the scope of\nthis review and are therefore not included in the presented AOP network.\n\nWithin the AOP-Wiki, 158  53 AOPs mentioning\neither oxidative stress or ROS as KE exist at the time of writing\nthis review ( Table S3 ). Of the 53 AOPs,\nonly 12 cover cancer as an adverse outcome (AO), highlighting the\ndiverse role of oxidative stress. In these 12 AOPs, various organs\nare linked to cancer resulting from induction of oxidative stress,\nincluding the liver, lung, breast, stomach and mesothelium. The diversity\nin target sites for the AO has implications for hazard assessment\nsince quantitative differences between organs presumably affect the\npoint of departure. Additionally, several currently existing AOPs\nlink cytotoxicity to carcinogenesis ( Table S4 ). Although these AOPs do not specifically mention induction of oxidative\nstress, this is known to be closely linked to cytotoxicity. 87  Notably, chronic or sustained activation of\nKEs is necessary for carcinogenesis to occur.\n\nThe described\nAOP network is exploratory and requires further development\nto elucidate the associated uncertainties. One uncertainty relates\nto the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative\nstress. While some AOPs suggest that oxidative stress is the consequence\nof mitochondrial dysfunction, others suggest that oxidative stress\nis the cause. Here it should be noted that AOPs are a simplified representation\nof complex biological networks. The discrepancy between different\nAOPs is most likely the result of this simplification. We chose to\ndepict mitochondrial dysfunction as the causative factor for oxidative\nstress since there is evidence for chemical interference with mitochondrial\ncomplexes leading to oxidative stress. 130  However, ROS have been described to disrupt mitochondrial function,\nand this should be taken into account upon quantification of the KER.\nAnother feedback loop within the AOP network includes damage to macromolecules\nby lipid peroxidation products, 145  causing\nreinforcement of the effect of oxidative stress. Moreover, inflammation\ncan both be portrayed as the causative and consequential factor in\nrelation to oxidative stress. This likely results from the interrelation\nbetween oxidative stress and inflammation as an abundance of ROS can\ntrigger production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn can\nstimulate ROS formation, resulting in a positive feedback loop. 62  Since the focus of our AOP network is chemically\ninduced oxidative stress, we depict oxidative stress as the cause\nand inflammation as the consequence. Similarly, oxidative stress can\ninduce ER stress through protein oxidation, and ER stress can, in\nturn, cause oxidative stress. 151  Lastly,\naltered cell survival and inflammation appear to be intertwined KEs.\nCell death is known to trigger inflammation through the production\nof damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), 159  and inflammation can induce cell death via a process referred\nto as pyroptosis (reviewed in 160 , 161 ). Importantly, all\nbiologically relevant feedback loops should be taken into account\nwhen quantifying the AOP network.\n\nWe would like to give a few\nconsiderations concerning the application\nof the proposed AOP network for  in vitro  testing.\nFirst, both the macromolecular and cellular KEs can be measured  in vitro  using a relatively simple model system, for example,\nHepG2 cells. Despite quantitative uncertainties due to the cancer\norigin, such cell lines can be used for high-throughput screening\nafter which more complex and relevant model systems can be used for\nfurther testing. One important challenge here is the definition of\noxidative stress. At present, no threshold to discern physiological\nROS levels from pathological ROS levels exist. Second, since prolonged\nactivation of KEs is required for carcinogenesis to occur, repeated,\nlow-dose exposure is hypothesized to be more relevant compared to\nsingle, high-dose exposure.  In vitro  assays are still\nlimited in their duration and applicability for testing repeated-dose\ntoxicity. Possibly, recovery experiments can shed light on the sustainability\nof induced effects. Lastly, no regulatory accepted  in vitro  assays for measuring proliferation currently exist. Additionally,\nthe AO cannot be measured  in vitro . Therefore, other\ndownstream KEs such as altered cell survival and tumor promoting inflammation\nare thought to be key in distinguishing carcinogens from noncarcinogens.  In vitro  testing of the KE tumor promoting inflammation\nrequires a complex model system containing multiple cell types, e.g.,\nhepatocytes, Kupffer cells and stellate cells. For the KE altered\ncell survival interpretation at the moment in unclear. Both an increase\nand a decrease in cell survival can be linked to carcinogenesis, for\nthe latter in combination with regenerative proliferation. Future\nresearch will have to elucidate how both different types of cell death\nand quantitative differences in cell survival are to be interpreted\nin relation to carcinogenesis.\n\nFor regulatory application of\nthis AOP network, quantification\nof the various KERs is essential. Not all substances that induce oxidative\nstress through one of the proposed MIEs are known to cause cancer.\nFor example, although acetaminophen (MIE: CYP2E1 activation) 162  and diclofenac (MIE: mitochondrial dysfunction) 163  are hepatotoxicants that are able to induce\noxidative stress, they are not known as (human) carcinogens. We hypothesize\nthat quantitative differences in certain KERs, specifically those\nassociated with the cancer hallmarks, are central in this distinction\nof carcinogenic potential. To illustrate, acetaminophen is highly\nhepatotoxic and possibly does not cause liver cancer because death\nby liver failure will precede carcinogenesis. 131  Next to this, toxicokinetic differences between substances\nare presumed to affect this inequity in AO induction as well. Furthermore,\ntarget sites can differ in their antioxidant capacity and varying\nresponses to oxidative stress by the microenvironment are thought\nto influence carcinogenesis. 137  Lastly,\nincreased cellular proliferation does not exclusively lead to carcinogenesis,\nhealthy regeneration can occur as well. Therefore, sustained perturbation\nof signaling, ultimately impairing normal regeneration and homeostasis,\nis expected to be fundamental in malignant transformation. Hazard\nassessment will thus have to qualitatively and quantitatively cover\nthe KERs in the proposed AOP network and consider tissue-specific\ndifferences in sensitivity."

A recognized mode of action for NGTX carcinogens\nis induction of oxidative stress, a state in which the amount of oxidants\nin a cell exceeds its antioxidant capacity, leading to regenerative\nproliferation. Currently, carcinogenicity assessment of environmental\nchemicals primarily relies on genetic toxicity end points. Since NGTX\ncarcinogens lack genotoxic potential, these chemicals may remain undetected\nin such evaluations. To enhance the predictivity of test strategies\nfor carcinogenicity assessment, a shift toward mechanism-based approaches\nis required. Here, we present an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network\nfor chemically induced oxidative stress leading to (NGTX) carcinogenesis.\nTo develop this AOP network, we first investigated the role of oxidative\nstress in the various cancer hallmarks. Next, possible mechanisms\nfor chemical induction of oxidative stress and the biological effects\nof oxidative damage to macromolecules were considered. This resulted\nin an AOP network, of which associated uncertainties were explored.\nUltimately, development of AOP networks relevant for carcinogenesis\nin humans will aid the transition to a mechanism-based, human relevant\ncarcinogenicity assessment that involves a substantially lower number\nof laboratory animals.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCarcinogenesis is a multistep process\nin which normal cells transform\ninto cancer cells by acquiring various, biologically diverse characteristics\nreferred to as cancer hallmarks. 1 − 3  At present, the International\nAgency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified 534 chemical compounds\nas proven human carcinogen (IARC 1), probable human carcinogen (IARC\n2A) or possible human carcinogen (IARC 2B). 4  These chemical carcinogens can induce tumor formation either through\ngenotoxic (GTX) or nongenotoxic (NGTX) mechanisms. 5  Compounds able to directly damage or interact with DNA\nare generally classified as GTX carcinogens, whereas NGTX carcinogens\ndo not directly interact with DNA nor the cellular apparatus involved\nin preserving genomic integrity. 6  Instead,\nNGTX carcinogens induce carcinogenesis via mechanisms including receptor\nactivation, chronic inflammation, immune suppression, endocrine disruption,\nepigenetic silencing or oxidative stress. 2 , 7 , 8  Both GTX and NGTX mechanisms of carcinogenesis\neventually involve the cancer hallmarks of genomic instability, loss\nof proliferative control and resistance to cell death. 5  Despite a wide spectrum of modes of action (MoAs) for NGTX\ncarcinogens, increased cell proliferation is shown to be a fundamental\nkey event (KE). 7 , 9  Receptor activation, sustained\ncytotoxicity, altered signal transduction, immunosuppression and induction\nof oxidative stress can all contribute to stimulation of cell proliferation. 1 , 7  Contrary to GTX carcinogens, NGTX carcinogens are hypothesized to\ninduce tumorigenesis through repeated or sustained exposure resulting\nin prolonged perturbation or modulation of physiological processes. 10 , 11\n\nOxidative stress leading to regenerative proliferation is\na MoA\nrelevant for carcinogenesis. 12 − 16  Upon an imbalance between the generation of oxidants, such as reactive\noxygen species (ROS), and their scavenging by antioxidants, oxidative\nstress is induced. 17  This imbalance can\narise from exposure to either endogenous or exogenous sources responsible\nfor oxidant generation or from depletion of antioxidants. 13  Oxidative stress is known to promote carcinogenesis\nthrough both DNA damage and impaired repair and through indirect actions\ninfluencing homeostasis and signaling. 18  Additionally, ROS play a role in numerous stages of the multistep\ncarcinogenic process. 19 , 20\n\nTraditionally, cancer hazard\nassessment requires long-term carcinogenicity\nstudies (OECD Test Guidelines 451 21 /453 22 ). There is a strong need for alternative approaches\nbecause rodent studies show limited translatability to man, 23  raise ethical concerns, have questionable reproducibility 7 , 24  and are time- and cost consuming. 23  Currently,\ncancer hazard assessment predominantly relies on genetic toxicity\nend points, since genetic damage is considered to be key to carcinogenicity. 25  While there is evidence of a GTX MoA for most\nof the substances classified by IARC, approximately 9% of these substances\nlack a GTX potential based on data from a battery of  in vitro  and  in vivo  genotoxicity tests, 8  indicating that NGTX carcinogens may remain undetected\nin such evaluations since these act via other mechanism than direct\ngenetic damage. Therefore, to enhance the prediction of carcinogenic\npotential of substances, transitioning toward a mechanism-based approach\nis deemed necessary. 7 , 25 − 28  To aid this transition, adverse\noutcome pathways (AOPs) could serve as a framework to select appropriate\nnew approach methodologies (NAMs) and identify research gaps.\n\nIn this article, an AOP network for chemically induced oxidative\nstress leading to (NGTX) carcinogenesis is proposed. We start with\nsummarizing the main findings concerning the role of oxidative stress\nin the cancer hallmarks and its relation to cancer in both animals\nand humans. Next, possible mechanisms for chemical induction of oxidative\nstress are considered. The relation between oxidative stress and the\ncancer hallmarks is further explored by discussing the biological\neffects of oxidative damage to macromolecules. Ultimately, we integrate\nthis information into an AOP network that can contribute to the development\nof an integrated approach to the testing and assessment (IATA) for\nsuspected (NGTX) carcinogens inducing oxidative stress. Given the\nbreadth of literature on oxidative stress as well as carcinogenesis,\nwe considered it necessary to demarcate the scope of this paper. This\nreview focuses on the role of ROS, whereas the role of reactive nitrogen\nspecies in oxidative stress and carcinogenesis is considered beyond\nthe scope of this paper. Additionally, although we are well aware\nof the interrelation between oxidative stress and inflammation, we\ndeliberately describe the discussed processes from an oxidative stress\nperspective.\n\n## Methodology\n\nA literature search was performed in October\n2021 using Embase.\nAs a search strategy ( Figure S1 ), certain\nkeywords such as oxidative stress/reactive oxygen species/oxygen radicals,\nchemical induction/carcinogen and carcinogenesis/tumorigenesis/cancer,\netc. were used. After compiling a list of 539 papers, abstracts were\nread and papers focusing on genotoxins, effects in offspring, and\nantioxidants, or when the full text could not be accessed were discarded.\nThe resulting papers were read and then either included or excluded\nbased on redundancy of information. Some additional relevant papers\nwere obtained through reference tracking. Papers published after October\n2021 that sufficed our search strategy were read and incorporated\nif assessed relevant.\n\n## Oxidative Stress in Relation to the Cancer Hallmarks\n\nDuring the process of carcinogenesis cells acquire certain characteristics\nreferred to as cancer hallmarks. 1 , 2  These hallmarks rationalize\nthe complex biological processes involved in tumor formation. 2 , 29 , 30  In a well-known review, Hanahan\nand Weinberg proposed the following six hallmarks: (1) ‘sustaining\nproliferative signaling’, (2) ‘evading growth suppression’,\n(3) ‘enabling replicative immortality’, (4) “inducing\nangiogenesis”, (5) “resisting cell death”, and\n(6) ‘activating invasion and metastasis’. 1  Later, two emerging hallmarks and two enabling\ncharacteristics were added: ‘avoiding immune destruction’,\n‘deregulating cellular energetics’, ‘genome instability\nand mutation’, and ‘tumor-promoting inflammation’. 2  Since then, novel insights into carcinogenesis\nhave led to occasional reconsideration of the cancer hallmarks 3 , 29 , 30  ( Figure  1 ).\n\nHallmarks of cancer. The 10 hallmarks of cancer\nas described by\nHanahan and Weinberg, 2  supplemented with\nnovel insights into carcinogenesis. 3 , 29 , 30  Translucent hallmarks are not discussed in this paper.\nThe inner circle schematically represents the signaling networks that\nconnect the hallmarks and the tumor microenvironment.\n\nA vast number of studies have described the relationship\nbetween\noxidative stress and carcinogenesis. 13 , 16 , 18 − 20 , 31 − 33  Generally, low concentrations of ROS are involved\nin regular biological processes such as transcriptional regulation,\ndifferentiation and proliferation, whereas high levels of ROS exceed\nthe antioxidant defense system, consequently inducing oxidative stress. 34  Carcinogenesis may occur when ROS exceed physiological\nlevels sustainably while avoiding excessive cell death. 20  ROS can induce tumor formation either through\nGTX or NGTX mechanisms. 13  Genotoxicity\noccurs when ROS interact with DNA and the resulting oxidative DNA\ndamage is not repaired prior to DNA replication. Alternatively, ROS\ncan modulate expression of genes and proteins, such as growth factors\nand proto-oncogenes, which play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis,\nwithout inflicting direct DNA damage. 13 , 18\n\nSince\nthe focus of this review is on NGTX carcinogenesis by chemical\ninduction of oxidative stress, the cancer hallmarks ‘activating\ninvasion and metastasis’ and ‘inducing angiogenesis’\nwill not be discussed. These hallmarks are considered late events\nin carcinogenesis, making it virtually impossible to distinguish chemically\ninduced oxidative stress from tumor-induced oxidative stress, thereby\nlowering its predictive value for human health protection and relevance\nfor chemical hazard assessment. 7  For the\ncancer hallmarks ‘enabling replicative immortality’\nand ‘deregulating cellular energetics’, we were unable\nto find sufficiently substantial, biologically relevant evidence for\ntheir relation with chemical induction of oxidative stress. Hence,\nthe focus of this review is on the relationship between oxidative\nstress and the cancer hallmarks ‘maintaining proliferative\ncapacity’ (fusion of sustaining proliferative signaling and\nevading growth suppression), ‘resisting cell death’,\n‘immune modulation’ (merger of avoiding immune destruction\nand tumor-promoting inflammation), and ‘genome instability\nand epigenetic dysregulation’, excluding direct GTX effects.\n\nCancer cells are\nknown for their ability to maintain proliferation. 2  One mechanism through which ROS are involved in sustaining\nproliferative signaling is through oxidation of phosphatases and subsequent\nactivation of signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation. 13 , 32 , 35  To illustrate, ROS can oxidize\nand subsequently inhibit phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN),\nleading to activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein\nkinase B (Akt) signaling. 36 , 37  Alternatively, PI3K/Akt\nsignaling activation can be mediated by oxidation of protein tyrosine\nphosphatase 1B (PTP1B). 38  Similarly, oxidation\nof mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP) leads\nto activation of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)\nsignaling. 39 , 40  MAPK/ERK signaling can be triggered\nthrough ROS-dependent intracellular calcium release and subsequent\nactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) as well. 41  Notably, induction of oxidative stress can both activate and repress\nnuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of B cells (NF-κB)\nsignaling. 35 , 42  Inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB)\noxidation results in dissociation, allowing nuclear translocation\nof NF-κB, 43  whereas oxidation of\nIκB kinase (IKK) prevents IκB degradation and subsequent\nNF-κB nuclear translocation. 44 , 45\n\nAlternatively,\ncell proliferation can be maintained through activation of activator\nprotein 1 (AP-1). Upon oxidation of thioredoxin (TRX), apoptosis signal-regulating\nkinase 1 (ASK1) activity is no longer inhibited, allowing c-Jun N-terminal\nkinase (JNK) proteins to translocate to the nucleus for induction\nof AP-1. 46 , 47  Activation of AP-1 induces expression of\ngrowth-stimulatory genes and suppresses cell cycle inhibitors. 13 , 48  Lastly, in response to oxidative modification of Kelch like ECH\nassociated protein 1 (KEAP1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor\n2 (NRF2) is activated and subsequent translocation to the nucleus\nleads to expression of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., Ki67\nand NOTCH1). 49 , 50\n\nThe normal balance between proliferation\nand cell death is disturbed in cancer cells. 29  ROS can disrupt this equilibrium either through inhibition of pro-apoptotic\nfactors or through induction of antiapoptotic factors, ultimately\nmediating resistance to cell death. For example, ROS can activate\nthe Akt pathway through oxidation of PTEN, 36 , 37  which may lead to increased cell survival via phosphorylation and\nconsequent inactivation of pro-apoptotic factors such as B-cell lymphoma\n(Bcl)-2-associated agonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X\nprotein (Bax), and Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). 33 , 51 , 52  Additionally, oxidative stress\ncan activate MAPK/p38, 53  NF-κB 43  and NRF2 50  signaling,\nresulting in reduced caspase activity. Moreover, NRF2 activation can\nreduce the release of cytochrome- c  from mitochondria,\npreventing apoptosis through inhibition of apoptosome formation. 54 , 55  Alternatively, ROS can induce expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2\nfamily members by means of NRF2, 54 , 55  NF-κB,\nand signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 (STAT3/5)\nsignaling. 56\n\nAccording to immune surveillance\ntheory, cells are continually monitored by the body’s immune\nsystem and eliminated upon becoming cancerous. 2  Following this principle, existing tumors have arisen from cells\nthat somehow managed to avoid detection and elimination by the immune\nsystem. Oxidative stress can mediate avoidance of immune destruction\nin three ways. First, oxidative stress can induce the formation of\nregulatory T-cells and strengthen their immunosuppressive potency. 57  Second, by inhibiting the interaction between\nthe T-cell receptor and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide\ncomplex, ROS can functionally impair cytotoxic T-cells, which play\na pivotal role in immune destruction of cancer cells. 58  Lastly, tumor-induced myeloid-derived suppressor cells\n(MDSCs) can inhibit T-cell proliferation in a ROS-dependent manner. 59\n\nContrarily, oxidative stress is also involved\nin creating a tumor-promoting inflammatory microenvironment. The abundance\nof ROS can trigger pro-oncogenic signaling pathways, for example,\nNF-κB, 43  MAPK, 40  and STAT3, 56  which in turn can\ncontribute to the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as\ntumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and\nIL-6. 56 , 60  Consecutively, these pro-inflammatory mediators\ncan stimulate both ROS production 61  and\npro-oncogenic signaling pathways involved in proliferation, angiogenesis,\ninvasion, and resistance to apoptosis. 62\n\nBesides\ndirect induction of mutations as a result of oxidative DNA damage,\noxidative stress can contribute to genome instability and epigenetic\ndysregulation. Repetitive sequences, which are particularly susceptible\nto DNA oxidation, can form secondary DNA structures upon oxidation. 63  During DNA replication, recruitment of a special\nbut error-prone DNA polymerase to these secondary DNA structures is\nneeded for continuation of synthesis, ultimately contributing to genome\ninstability. 63  Furthermore, ROS-induced\nexpression of Bcl-2, following NRF2, 54 , 55  NF-κB,\nor STAT3/5 signaling, 56  can inhibit DNA\ndouble-strand break (DSB) repair. 64  Lastly,\nROS-induced inflammation can cause both microsatellite and chromosomal\ninstability via dysregulation of DNA repair enzymes, defective mitotic\ncheckpoints, induction of DSBs, and dysregulated homologous recombination\n(reviewed in ref ( 65 )).\n\nAlternatively, ROS can cause alterations in the DNA methylation\nstatus through interaction with DNA and proteins. 15  As a result of DNA oxidation, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine\n(8-OHdG) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) may be formed. 66 , 67  Consequently, DNA binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBPs),\nepigenetic regulators responsible for DNA methyl transferase (DNMT)\nand histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruitment can be inhibited and these\nDNA regions might therefore get hypomethylated. 66 , 67  Most demethylated regions are promoters belonging to oncogenes,\nwhich consequently can be activated. 15 , 68 , 69  Additionally, methylation of repetitive and transposable\nelements is often lost in cancer, which can result in random integration\nof these elements into the genome and subsequently cause genetic instability. 15 , 70  On the other hand, ROS can also mediate hypermethylation and subsequent\nloss of tumor suppressor promoter regions through upregulation and\nrecruitment of DNMT and HDAC, a phenomenon frequently observed in\nhuman cancers. 15 , 71  For example, hypermethylation\nof the human mutL homologue 1 (hMLH1) promoter region diminishes its\nexpression, 72  which is related to repressed\nactivity of the mismatch repair system. 73\n\n## Maintaining Proliferative Capacity\n\nCancer cells are\nknown for their ability to maintain proliferation. 2  One mechanism through which ROS are involved in sustaining\nproliferative signaling is through oxidation of phosphatases and subsequent\nactivation of signaling pathways associated with cell proliferation. 13 , 32 , 35  To illustrate, ROS can oxidize\nand subsequently inhibit phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN),\nleading to activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein\nkinase B (Akt) signaling. 36 , 37  Alternatively, PI3K/Akt\nsignaling activation can be mediated by oxidation of protein tyrosine\nphosphatase 1B (PTP1B). 38  Similarly, oxidation\nof mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase (MKP) leads\nto activation of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)\nsignaling. 39 , 40  MAPK/ERK signaling can be triggered\nthrough ROS-dependent intracellular calcium release and subsequent\nactivation of protein kinase C (PKC) as well. 41  Notably, induction of oxidative stress can both activate and repress\nnuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of B cells (NF-κB)\nsignaling. 35 , 42  Inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB)\noxidation results in dissociation, allowing nuclear translocation\nof NF-κB, 43  whereas oxidation of\nIκB kinase (IKK) prevents IκB degradation and subsequent\nNF-κB nuclear translocation. 44 , 45\n\nAlternatively,\ncell proliferation can be maintained through activation of activator\nprotein 1 (AP-1). Upon oxidation of thioredoxin (TRX), apoptosis signal-regulating\nkinase 1 (ASK1) activity is no longer inhibited, allowing c-Jun N-terminal\nkinase (JNK) proteins to translocate to the nucleus for induction\nof AP-1. 46 , 47  Activation of AP-1 induces expression of\ngrowth-stimulatory genes and suppresses cell cycle inhibitors. 13 , 48  Lastly, in response to oxidative modification of Kelch like ECH\nassociated protein 1 (KEAP1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor\n2 (NRF2) is activated and subsequent translocation to the nucleus\nleads to expression of genes involved in proliferation (e.g., Ki67\nand NOTCH1). 49 , 50\n\n## Resisting Cell Death\n\nThe normal balance between proliferation\nand cell death is disturbed in cancer cells. 29  ROS can disrupt this equilibrium either through inhibition of pro-apoptotic\nfactors or through induction of antiapoptotic factors, ultimately\nmediating resistance to cell death. For example, ROS can activate\nthe Akt pathway through oxidation of PTEN, 36 , 37  which may lead to increased cell survival via phosphorylation and\nconsequent inactivation of pro-apoptotic factors such as B-cell lymphoma\n(Bcl)-2-associated agonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X\nprotein (Bax), and Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). 33 , 51 , 52  Additionally, oxidative stress\ncan activate MAPK/p38, 53  NF-κB 43  and NRF2 50  signaling,\nresulting in reduced caspase activity. Moreover, NRF2 activation can\nreduce the release of cytochrome- c  from mitochondria,\npreventing apoptosis through inhibition of apoptosome formation. 54 , 55  Alternatively, ROS can induce expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2\nfamily members by means of NRF2, 54 , 55  NF-κB,\nand signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 (STAT3/5)\nsignaling. 56\n\n## Immune Modulation\n\nAccording to immune surveillance\ntheory, cells are continually monitored by the body’s immune\nsystem and eliminated upon becoming cancerous. 2  Following this principle, existing tumors have arisen from cells\nthat somehow managed to avoid detection and elimination by the immune\nsystem.

Repetitive sequences, which are particularly susceptible\nto DNA oxidation, can form secondary DNA structures upon oxidation. 63  During DNA replication, recruitment of a special\nbut error-prone DNA polymerase to these secondary DNA structures is\nneeded for continuation of synthesis, ultimately contributing to genome\ninstability. 63  Furthermore, ROS-induced\nexpression of Bcl-2, following NRF2, 54 , 55  NF-κB,\nor STAT3/5 signaling, 56  can inhibit DNA\ndouble-strand break (DSB) repair. 64  Lastly,\nROS-induced inflammation can cause both microsatellite and chromosomal\ninstability via dysregulation of DNA repair enzymes, defective mitotic\ncheckpoints, induction of DSBs, and dysregulated homologous recombination\n(reviewed in ref ( 65 )).\n\nAlternatively, ROS can cause alterations in the DNA methylation\nstatus through interaction with DNA and proteins. 15  As a result of DNA oxidation, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine\n(8-OHdG) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) may be formed. 66 , 67  Consequently, DNA binding of methyl-CpG binding proteins (MBPs),\nepigenetic regulators responsible for DNA methyl transferase (DNMT)\nand histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruitment can be inhibited and these\nDNA regions might therefore get hypomethylated. 66 , 67  Most demethylated regions are promoters belonging to oncogenes,\nwhich consequently can be activated. 15 , 68 , 69  Additionally, methylation of repetitive and transposable\nelements is often lost in cancer, which can result in random integration\nof these elements into the genome and subsequently cause genetic instability. 15 , 70  On the other hand, ROS can also mediate hypermethylation and subsequent\nloss of tumor suppressor promoter regions through upregulation and\nrecruitment of DNMT and HDAC, a phenomenon frequently observed in\nhuman cancers. 15 , 71  For example, hypermethylation\nof the human mutL homologue 1 (hMLH1) promoter region diminishes its\nexpression, 72  which is related to repressed\nactivity of the mismatch repair system. 73\n\n## Oxidative Stress in Cancer\n\nOxidative stress leading\nto regenerative proliferation is one of\nthe best documented mechanisms for carcinogenesis. 12 − 15  About half of the IARC 1 classified\nsubstances (35 out of 86) were shown to have the ability to induce\noxidative stress. 74  Notably, chronic inflammation,\nassociated with ROS formation and altered signaling, has become a\nwell-recognized risk factor for various human cancers. 14 , 62  Evidence for the role of oxidative stress in carcinogenesis can\nbe found in both animals and humans.\n\nClear evidence for oxidative\nstress leading to regenerative proliferation as a carcinogenic MoA\nin animals was derived from rodent knockout studies. Loss of antioxidant\ngenes, such as superoxide dismutase 1 ( Sod1 ), 75 , 76  peroxiredoxin 1 ( Prdx1 ) 77 , 78  and glutathione peroxidase ( Gpx ), 79  was shown to predispose mice to oxidative DNA damage and\ncarcinogenesis. Moreover, contrary to wildtype mice, mice with a knockout\nof cytochrome P450 2E1 ( Cyp2e1 ; a known electron\nleaker during xenobiotic metabolism) were shown to not manifest hepatotoxicity\nnor regenerative proliferation upon exposure to chloroform. 80  In another study,  Cyp2e1 -null\nmice showed no oxidative damage phenotype whereas wildtype and humanized  Cyp2e1  mice did. 81  Furthermore,\nimpaired liver regeneration has been observed in rodents lacking either\nAP-1 (c-Jun monomer) or NF-κB, both are essential transcription\nfactors for hepatic regenerative proliferation. 82 , 83  Inhibition of IL-1α 84  or hematopoietic\ndepletion of inhibitor of NF-κB kinase β ( Ikkβ ) 85  in mice resulted in decreased regenerative\nproliferation. Lastly,  Jnk1  knockout mice showed\nimpaired cellular proliferation and subsequent decreased liver carcinogenesis. 86\n\nIn a project by the European Partnership\nfor Alternative Approaches to animal testing (EPAA), 170 NGTX carcinogenic\nagrochemicals were evaluated, with the aim to assess the tumor types\ninduced and organs affected and to identify the various MoAs underlying\nthe carcinogenic potential. 10  Mechanistic\ninformation collected on the NGTX carcinogens resulted in a list of\nnine MoAs, including sustained cytotoxicity leading to regenerative\nproliferation. Of the 96 substances for which a MoA could be established,\n49 (51%) were presumed to induce sustained cytotoxicity. This MoA\nhas been observed for tumors in the liver, kidney, stomach, bladder,\nand intestine. 10  Induction of oxidative\nstress is a central event within the MoA sustained cytotoxicity. 87  However, only for four of the 49 substances,\ninduction of oxidative stress was explicitly mentioned. 10  Together these four substances induced seven\nunique treatment-related tumors affecting the liver, spleen and lymphoid\nsystem. 10\n\nEvidence for the role of\noxidative stress in carcinogenesis in humans mainly comes from epidemiological\nstudies. Increased risk of cancer of the liver, kidney, blood, immune\nsystem, bladder and gastrointestinal tract has been reported in humans\nafter exposure to carcinogens known to operate via oxidative stress\nin animals. 88 − 96  For instance, GTX carcinogens (pharmaceuticals) that induce oxidative\nDNA damage, such as cyclophosphamide, etoposide, tamoxifen and azathioprine, 97 , 98  have epidemiologically been linked to elevated cancer risk. 89  Epidemiological evidence for NGTX carcinogens\noperating via oxidative stress exist as well; a few examples are described\nhere. In a large cohort study of 23,829 sawmill workers in British\nColumbia, substantial evidence of an association between pentachlorophenol\nexposure and the incidence of liver cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and\nmultiple myeloma was found. 90  Additionally,\noccupational exposure to pentachlorophenol might elevate the risk\nof hematopoietic, 99  neurological and digestive\ntract cancer. 100  Evidence for oxidative\nstress induction following pentachlorophenol exposure has been found\nboth in cells with a human origin and in mice. 101 , 102  Another example is exposure to trichloroethylene, for which an epidemiological\nlink to increased risk of kidney cancer, 88 , 92 − 95  non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 92 , 94 , 103  and liver cancer 94 , 96  has been found. Trichloroethylene\nhas been shown to induce oxidative stress in a human hepatic cell\nline 104  and in rats. 105  Moreover, in a prospective cohort of pesticide applicators,\nan association between thyroid cancer and lindane exposure was observed. 106  Agricultural use of lindane also has been associated\nwith an elevated risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 107 , 108  In rats, lindane exposure was shown to induce oxidative stress. 109\n\nAnother line of evidence for human relevance\nderives from genetic variation in oxidative-stress related genes and\ncancer susceptibility in the human population. 18  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in antioxidant enzymes\nSOD and catalase (CAT) have been linked to increased cancer incidence\nand susceptibility. 110  Moreover, SNPs altering\nthe function of AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1) and 8-oxo-guanine DNA glycosylase\n(OGG1), DNA repair genes primarily involved in base excision repair\nof oxidative DNA damage, 18  have been linked\nto increased cancer risk in humans. 111 − 113\n\nNext to this,\nbiomarkers of oxidative stress can be found in cancer\npatients as well, though it should be noted that these are not indicative\nof a role for oxidative stress in tumor initiation. Increased total\noxidant, decreased total antioxidant, 114 − 119  elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) 114 , 116 , 120 , 121  and increased protein\ncarbonyl serum levels 117 − 119 , 122  are found\nin cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Moreover, the catalogue\nof somatic mutations in cancer (COSMIC) has identified a mutational\nsignature (SBS18) in human cancers which is associated with oxidative\nDNA damage. 123  Finally, 8-OHdG, a biomarker\nfor oxidative DNA damage, can be quantified in biopsies and urinary\nsamples from cancer patients. 8-OHdG levels were found to be significantly\nincreased in chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatocellular carcinoma\n(HCC) compared to chronic hepatitis C patients without HCC. 124  Both 8-OHdG and NRF2 expressions were found\nto be significantly elevated in cancerous tissue compared to noncancerous\ntissue of HCC patients. 125  Again, these\nbiomarkers are indicative of oxidative stress in the cancer patient\nwhich is more likely the consequence rather than the cause of the\ntumor.\n\n## Animal Carcinogenicity Data\n\nClear evidence for oxidative\nstress leading to regenerative proliferation as a carcinogenic MoA\nin animals was derived from rodent knockout studies. Loss of antioxidant\ngenes, such as superoxide dismutase 1 ( Sod1 ), 75 , 76  peroxiredoxin 1 ( Prdx1 ) 77 , 78  and glutathione peroxidase ( Gpx ), 79  was shown to predispose mice to oxidative DNA damage and\ncarcinogenesis. Moreover, contrary to wildtype mice, mice with a knockout\nof cytochrome P450 2E1 ( Cyp2e1 ; a known electron\nleaker during xenobiotic metabolism) were shown to not manifest hepatotoxicity\nnor regenerative proliferation upon exposure to chloroform. 80  In another study,  Cyp2e1 -null\nmice showed no oxidative damage phenotype whereas wildtype and humanized  Cyp2e1  mice did. 81  Furthermore,\nimpaired liver regeneration has been observed in rodents lacking either\nAP-1 (c-Jun monomer) or NF-κB, both are essential transcription\nfactors for hepatic regenerative proliferation. 82 , 83  Inhibition of IL-1α 84  or hematopoietic\ndepletion of inhibitor of NF-κB kinase β ( Ikkβ ) 85  in mice resulted in decreased regenerative\nproliferation. Lastly,  Jnk1  knockout mice showed\nimpaired cellular proliferation and subsequent decreased liver carcinogenesis. 86\n\nIn a project by the European Partnership\nfor Alternative Approaches to animal testing (EPAA), 170 NGTX carcinogenic\nagrochemicals were evaluated, with the aim to assess the tumor types\ninduced and organs affected and to identify the various MoAs underlying\nthe carcinogenic potential. 10  Mechanistic\ninformation collected on the NGTX carcinogens resulted in a list of\nnine MoAs, including sustained cytotoxicity leading to regenerative\nproliferation. Of the 96 substances for which a MoA could be established,\n49 (51%) were presumed to induce sustained cytotoxicity. This MoA\nhas been observed for tumors in the liver, kidney, stomach, bladder,\nand intestine. 10  Induction of oxidative\nstress is a central event within the MoA sustained cytotoxicity. 87  However, only for four of the 49 substances,\ninduction of oxidative stress was explicitly mentioned. 10  Together these four substances induced seven\nunique treatment-related tumors affecting the liver, spleen and lymphoid\nsystem. 10\n\n## Human Carcinogenicity Data\n\nEvidence for the role of\noxidative stress in carcinogenesis in humans mainly comes from epidemiological\nstudies. Increased risk of cancer of the liver, kidney, blood, immune\nsystem, bladder and gastrointestinal tract has been reported in humans\nafter exposure to carcinogens known to operate via oxidative stress\nin animals. 88 − 96  For instance, GTX carcinogens (pharmaceuticals) that induce oxidative\nDNA damage, such as cyclophosphamide, etoposide, tamoxifen and azathioprine, 97 , 98  have epidemiologically been linked to elevated cancer risk. 89  Epidemiological evidence for NGTX carcinogens\noperating via oxidative stress exist as well; a few examples are described\nhere.

Increased total\noxidant, decreased total antioxidant, 114 − 119  elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) 114 , 116 , 120 , 121  and increased protein\ncarbonyl serum levels 117 − 119 , 122  are found\nin cancer patients compared to healthy controls.

Direct mechanisms include mitochondrial and\nextramitochondrial production of oxygen radicals, whereas impact on\nthe antioxidant defense system is considered an indirect mechanism. 13  Notably, chemical induction of oxidative stress\nis not restricted to carcinogens nor carcinogenesis. 126 − 128\n\nAn example of\na direct mechanism of oxidative stress induction is mitochondrial\nproduction of oxygen radicals. Interaction of substances with mitochondria,\nespecially mitochondrial complex I and III, 13  during oxidative phosphorylation is considered to be central in\nthe formation of ROS. 129  By blocking electron\ntransport, a substance can induce mitochondrial membrane depolarization,\nand consequently ROS production. 130\n\nAnother mechanism of ROS formation is closely related to the biotransformation\nof a substance. During detoxification of substances, CYP enzymes are\ninduced. 14  CYP enzymes catalyze the transfer\nof oxygen to the substrate, a process thoroughly associated with nicotinamide\nadenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. 48  Upon disturbance of this association, electrons derived\nfrom NADPH can reduce CYP-oxygen complexes, consequently generating\nROS. 14 , 18 , 48  Moreover,\nvarious CYP enzymes, specifically CYP2E1, can leak electrons during\nthe course of their catalytic cycle, producing ROS in the process. 48 , 131 , 132  CYP1A, CYP1B1, CYP1D1 and CYP3A4\nhave also been described to produce ROS during their catalytic cycle, 133  either through direct interaction with a substance\nor through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in case\nof CYP1A1. 134\n\nAn indirect mechanism\nof oxidative stress induction is reduction of antioxidants, of which\nthe primary function is to protect the body against overload of oxidants. 135  The antioxidant defense system consists of\nthree parts: enzymes, vitamins and minerals. 135 , 136  This review focuses on enzymatic antioxidants since we consider\nthese most relevant for exposure to environmental chemicals. The main\nhuman enzymatic antioxidants include SOD, CAT, GPX and PRDX. 135 , 137  SOD converts superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide. 138  Next, hydrogen peroxide can be converted by\neither CAT, GPX or PRDX. 137  CAT directly\nconverts hydrogen peroxide in water and oxygen, 139  whereas GPX and PRDX require cofactors such as reduced\nglutathione (GSH) or reduced TRX, respectively, to convert hydrogen\nperoxide in water while oxidizing GSH and TRX. 137 , 140  Glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (TR) can convert\noxidized GSH and TRX, respectively, back to their reduced states by\nconverting NADPH to NADP + . 137 , 140  Glutathione- S -transferase (GST) uses GSH for oxidant detoxification\nas well. 137\n\n## Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species\n\nAn example of\na direct mechanism of oxidative stress induction is mitochondrial\nproduction of oxygen radicals.

For example, hydrogen peroxide mostly oxidizes\ncysteine residues of proteins reversibly, controlling protein activity\nsimilarly to other post-translation modifications (e.g., phosphorylation),\nwhereas highly reactive ROS, such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals,\nare most likely to induce lipid peroxidation and cell death. 137\n\nLipid peroxidation is the\nprocess in which ROS break down polyunsaturated fatty acids, damaging\nlipid-containing cellular components, such as the cell membrane, mitochondria,\nand the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 141 − 143  Membrane permeability\nand fluidity and activity of membrane-bound proteins can be affected\nby lipid peroxidation. 129 , 144  Importantly, products\nof lipid peroxidation, such as MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 141 , 142  can react with other macromolecules further impairing cellular function. 143 , 145\n\nLipid peroxidation can affect cell signaling pathways involved\nin proliferation, inflammation and cell death ( Figure  2 ). It is important to note that, similar\nto ROS itself, low levels of lipid peroxidation have proliferative\neffects, whereas high levels induce cell death. 146  For example, low concentrations of 4-HNE can trigger activation\nof PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, while high concentrations\nof 4-HNE are cytotoxic. 146  Lipid peroxidation\nmediated cytotoxicity can either lead to cell death or uncontrolled\ncell growth. 147 , 148  Moreover, lipid peroxidation\nproducts can induce inflammatory responses through JNK. 149\n\nSchematic representation of ROS-induced damage and biological\neffects\nin relation to carcinogenesis. ROS can interact with and damage lipids\n(green/left), proteins (blue/middle) and DNA (red/right). Through\nsignaling pathways, oxidative modification of macromolecules can contribute\nto various cancer hallmarks and, ultimately, carcinogenesis. Inflammation\nalso affects neighboring cells.

Upon oxidation\nof TRX 46  or phosphatases, 36 − 40 , 43  such as MKP, PTEN, PTP1B, and\nIκB, proliferative signaling is stimulated. Alternatively, oxidative\nstress can result in intracellular release of calcium, 152  consequently stimulating PKC signaling, which\nin turn can activate MAPK/ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways. 41  Moreover, protein oxidation can enhance survival\nthrough oxidation of PTEN, followed by PI3K/Akt activation and subsequent\ninactivation of pro-apoptotic Bad, Bax, and Bim. 33 , 51 , 52  Additionally, oxidation of IκB lifts\nits inhibitory effect on NF-κB signaling, which can both reduce\ncaspase activity 43  and induce expression\nof antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. 56  This can also be mediated by oxidation of KEAP1 and subsequent activation\nof NRF2 signaling. 50 , 54 , 55  Lastly, NF-κB signaling contributes to inflammation via the\nproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators. 56 , 60\n\nROS-induced oxidative DNA modification\nmay result in alteration of the DNA methylation status 15  or genomic instability following DNA oxidation-induced\nsecondary structures. 63  These alterations\nin DNA methylation, resulting from oxidative modification of MBPs,\nDNMTs, and HDACs, 66 , 67  can activate proto-oncogenes,\nsuch as c-Myc, Kras and c-Jun, as a result of promoter hypomethylation, 68 , 69  and inactivate tumor suppressors, for instance RUNX3 (RUNX family\ntranscription factor 3) and hMLH1, following promoter hypermethylation 72 , 153  ( Figure  2 ). Altered\nregulation of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is pivotal\nin carcinogenesis. 154\n\nOxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA can affect multiple\ncancer hallmarks, including maintaining proliferative capacity, immune\nmodulation, resistance to cell death, and genomic instability and\nepigenetic dysregulation ( Figure  2 ). Ultimately, through contribution to these cancer\ncharacteristics, carcinogenesis can be initiated and promoted. 1 , 2  Notably, cancer hallmarks can be induced through oxidative damage\nto one specific class of macromolecules or to multiple ( Figure  2 ). Importantly, oxidative damage\nmediated cell death can be compensated by regenerative proliferation. 155 , 156\n\n## Oxidative Damage to Lipids\n\nLipid peroxidation is the\nprocess in which ROS break down polyunsaturated fatty acids, damaging\nlipid-containing cellular components, such as the cell membrane, mitochondria,\nand the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 141 − 143  Membrane permeability\nand fluidity and activity of membrane-bound proteins can be affected\nby lipid peroxidation. 129 , 144  Importantly, products\nof lipid peroxidation, such as MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 141 , 142  can react with other macromolecules further impairing cellular function. 143 , 145\n\nLipid peroxidation can affect cell signaling pathways involved\nin proliferation, inflammation and cell death ( Figure  2 ).

Upon oxidation\nof TRX 46  or phosphatases, 36 − 40 , 43  such as MKP, PTEN, PTP1B, and\nIκB, proliferative signaling is stimulated. Alternatively, oxidative\nstress can result in intracellular release of calcium, 152  consequently stimulating PKC signaling, which\nin turn can activate MAPK/ERK and NF-κB signaling pathways. 41  Moreover, protein oxidation can enhance survival\nthrough oxidation of PTEN, followed by PI3K/Akt activation and subsequent\ninactivation of pro-apoptotic Bad, Bax, and Bim. 33 , 51 , 52  Additionally, oxidation of IκB lifts\nits inhibitory effect on NF-κB signaling, which can both reduce\ncaspase activity 43  and induce expression\nof antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. 56  This can also be mediated by oxidation of KEAP1 and subsequent activation\nof NRF2 signaling. 50 , 54 , 55  Lastly, NF-κB signaling contributes to inflammation via the\nproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators. 56 , 60\n\n## Oxidative Damage to DNA\n\nROS-induced oxidative DNA modification\nmay result in alteration of the DNA methylation status 15  or genomic instability following DNA oxidation-induced\nsecondary structures. 63  These alterations\nin DNA methylation, resulting from oxidative modification of MBPs,\nDNMTs, and HDACs, 66 , 67  can activate proto-oncogenes,\nsuch as c-Myc, Kras and c-Jun, as a result of promoter hypomethylation, 68 , 69  and inactivate tumor suppressors, for instance RUNX3 (RUNX family\ntranscription factor 3) and hMLH1, following promoter hypermethylation 72 , 153  ( Figure  2 ). Altered\nregulation of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is pivotal\nin carcinogenesis. 154\n\n## Relation with the Cancer Hallmarks and Carcinogenesis\n\nOxidative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA can affect multiple\ncancer hallmarks, including maintaining proliferative capacity, immune\nmodulation, resistance to cell death, and genomic instability and\nepigenetic dysregulation ( Figure  2 ). Ultimately, through contribution to these cancer\ncharacteristics, carcinogenesis can be initiated and promoted. 1 , 2  Notably, cancer hallmarks can be induced through oxidative damage\nto one specific class of macromolecules or to multiple ( Figure  2 ). Importantly, oxidative damage\nmediated cell death can be compensated by regenerative proliferation. 155 , 156\n\n## Proposed AOP Network for Chemical Induction of Oxidative Stress\nLeading to (Non)genotoxic Carcinogenesis\n\nThrough structuring\nthe above-described information regarding the\nrole of oxidative stress in the cancer hallmarks, chemical induction\nof oxidative stress and oxidative damage to macromolecules, we have\ndeveloped an AOP network for chemically induced oxidative stress leading\nto carcinogenesis ( Figure  3 ). Notably, this is an outline AOP network that requires further\ndevelopment especially a detailed description of the KEs and key event\nrelationships (KERs). A preliminary weight of evidence (WoE) evaluation\nwas performed ( Table S1A–D ) according\nto OECD guidance. 157  Adjacent KERs were\nassessed for both biological plausibility ( Table S1A ) and empirical evidence including consideration of contradictions\n( Table S1C ), while KEs were assessed for\nessentiality ( Table S1B ). For this, we\nrelied on the WoE assessments available in the AOP-Wiki ( aopwiki.org ) as well as scientific\nliterature. Details are given in  Tables S1A–D , with  Table S1D  providing a summary of\nthe WoE for each of the adjacent KERs. Overall, the biological plausibility\nfor the direct relationships in this AOP network is fairly strong.\nEvidence from empirical studies partly supports this assessment, but\nfor some KERs the number of published studies appeared to be limited.\nThe essentiality of the KEs in the AOP network, which can be demonstrated\nby modulating one KE and observing concordance in the downstream KEs,\nwas considered as moderate. Based on this, we consider the overall\nWoE of the AOP network moderate to strong: certain branches are very\ndata rich, providing strong evidence, whereas other branches require\nmore data to be generated. Additionally, to further examine this AOP\nnetwork, a noncomprehensive list of possible assays for KEs and reference\nchemicals for these assays is provided in  Table S2 .\n\nProposed network of AOPs for chemically induced oxidative stress\nleading to carcinogenesis. Chronic or prolonged activation of the\nmolecular initiating event and subsequent key events is required for\nthis AOP network to trigger the adverse outcome. Molecular initiating\nevents are depicted in green, cellular effects in orange, tissue effects\nin bright red and the adverse outcome in dark red. Cancer hallmarks\nare depicted in bold. Italicized text represent associated signaling\npathways. Examples of cytochrome P450 enzymes, oxidases and key proteins\nin protein oxidation are given in parentheses.\n\nThe AOP network consists of five molecular initiating\nevents (MIEs),\nnamely activation of specific CYPs, inhibition of mitochondrial complexes,\nimpacting on cellular antioxidant capacity, sustained AhR activation,\nand oxidase activation, which may all lead to oxidative stress. Following\nthe central KE oxidative stress, three parallel KEs can be induced:\nlipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and oxidative DNA damage. Sufficient\nactivation of these KEs can result in ER stress, altered cell survival,\nand/or genomic instability. Altered cell survival can result in tumor\npromoting inflammation, which in turn can lead to sustained or regenerative\nproliferation. Moreover, both genomic instability and altered cell\nsurvival can also result in regenerative or sustained proliferation.\nSufficient and persistent activation of this KE can lead to tumor\nformation. Notably, both sustained or regenerative proliferation and\nmutations are pivotal in carcinogenesis, and their relationships to\ncarcinogenesis are interlaced. Importantly, chronic or prolonged activation\nof the MIEs and subsequent KEs is necessary to trigger cancer.\n\n## Discussion and Conclusion\n\nIn the preceding sections,\nwe reported evidence for the role of\noxidative stress in carcinogenesis along the lines of the cancer hallmarks.\nWe summarized the main findings concerning the role of oxidative stress\nin cancer in both animals and humans. Lastly, we described how chemicals\ncan induce oxidative stress, and how oxidative stress to macromolecules\nrelates to cell death, ER stress, inflammation, proliferation, and\ngenomic instability. Our efforts have led to the development of an\nAOP network for chemically induced oxidative stress leading to carcinogenesis\n( Figure  3 ), which can\nbe used to guide the development of an IATA for suspected NGTX carcinogens\ninducing oxidative stress. Notably, many other mechanism relevant\nfor tumorigenesis exist. These were considered beyond the scope of\nthis review and are therefore not included in the presented AOP network.\n\nWithin the AOP-Wiki, 158  53 AOPs mentioning\neither oxidative stress or ROS as KE exist at the time of writing\nthis review ( Table S3 ). Of the 53 AOPs,\nonly 12 cover cancer as an adverse outcome (AO), highlighting the\ndiverse role of oxidative stress. In these 12 AOPs, various organs\nare linked to cancer resulting from induction of oxidative stress,\nincluding the liver, lung, breast, stomach and mesothelium. The diversity\nin target sites for the AO has implications for hazard assessment\nsince quantitative differences between organs presumably affect the\npoint of departure. Additionally, several currently existing AOPs\nlink cytotoxicity to carcinogenesis ( Table S4 ). Although these AOPs do not specifically mention induction of oxidative\nstress, this is known to be closely linked to cytotoxicity. 87  Notably, chronic or sustained activation of\nKEs is necessary for carcinogenesis to occur.\n\nThe described\nAOP network is exploratory and requires further development\nto elucidate the associated uncertainties. One uncertainty relates\nto the relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative\nstress. While some AOPs suggest that oxidative stress is the consequence\nof mitochondrial dysfunction, others suggest that oxidative stress\nis the cause. Here it should be noted that AOPs are a simplified representation\nof complex biological networks. The discrepancy between different\nAOPs is most likely the result of this simplification. We chose to\ndepict mitochondrial dysfunction as the causative factor for oxidative\nstress since there is evidence for chemical interference with mitochondrial\ncomplexes leading to oxidative stress. 130  However, ROS have been described to disrupt mitochondrial function,\nand this should be taken into account upon quantification of the KER.\nAnother feedback loop within the AOP network includes damage to macromolecules\nby lipid peroxidation products, 145  causing\nreinforcement of the effect of oxidative stress. Moreover, inflammation\ncan both be portrayed as the causative and consequential factor in\nrelation to oxidative stress. This likely results from the interrelation\nbetween oxidative stress and inflammation as an abundance of ROS can\ntrigger production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn can\nstimulate ROS formation, resulting in a positive feedback loop. 62  Since the focus of our AOP network is chemically\ninduced oxidative stress, we depict oxidative stress as the cause\nand inflammation as the consequence. Similarly, oxidative stress can\ninduce ER stress through protein oxidation, and ER stress can, in\nturn, cause oxidative stress. 151  Lastly,\naltered cell survival and inflammation appear to be intertwined KEs.\nCell death is known to trigger inflammation through the production\nof damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), 159  and inflammation can induce cell death via a process referred\nto as pyroptosis (reviewed in 160 , 161 ). Importantly, all\nbiologically relevant feedback loops should be taken into account\nwhen quantifying the AOP network.\n\nWe would like to give a few\nconsiderations concerning the application\nof the proposed AOP network for  in vitro  testing.\nFirst, both the macromolecular and cellular KEs can be measured  in vitro  using a relatively simple model system, for example,\nHepG2 cells. Despite quantitative uncertainties due to the cancer\norigin, such cell lines can be used for high-throughput screening\nafter which more complex and relevant model systems can be used for\nfurther testing. One important challenge here is the definition of\noxidative stress. At present, no threshold to discern physiological\nROS levels from pathological ROS levels exist. Second, since prolonged\nactivation of KEs is required for carcinogenesis to occur, repeated,\nlow-dose exposure is hypothesized to be more relevant compared to\nsingle, high-dose exposure.  In vitro  assays are still\nlimited in their duration and applicability for testing repeated-dose\ntoxicity. Possibly, recovery experiments can shed light on the sustainability\nof induced effects. Lastly, no regulatory accepted  in vitro  assays for measuring proliferation currently exist. Additionally,\nthe AO cannot be measured  in vitro . Therefore, other\ndownstream KEs such as altered cell survival and tumor promoting inflammation\nare thought to be key in distinguishing carcinogens from noncarcinogens.  In vitro  testing of the KE tumor promoting inflammation\nrequires a complex model system containing multiple cell types, e.g.,\nhepatocytes, Kupffer cells and stellate cells. For the KE altered\ncell survival interpretation at the moment in unclear. Both an increase\nand a decrease in cell survival can be linked to carcinogenesis, for\nthe latter in combination with regenerative proliferation. Future\nresearch will have to elucidate how both different types of cell death\nand quantitative differences in cell survival are to be interpreted\nin relation to carcinogenesis.\n\nFor regulatory application of\nthis AOP network, quantification\nof the various KERs is essential. Not all substances that induce oxidative\nstress through one of the proposed MIEs are known to cause cancer.\nFor example, although acetaminophen (MIE: CYP2E1 activation) 162  and diclofenac (MIE: mitochondrial dysfunction) 163  are hepatotoxicants that are able to induce\noxidative stress, they are not known as (human) carcinogens. We hypothesize\nthat quantitative differences in certain KERs, specifically those\nassociated with the cancer hallmarks, are central in this distinction\nof carcinogenic potential. To illustrate, acetaminophen is highly\nhepatotoxic and possibly does not cause liver cancer because death\nby liver failure will precede carcinogenesis. 131  Next to this, toxicokinetic differences between substances\nare presumed to affect this inequity in AO induction as well. Furthermore,\ntarget sites can differ in their antioxidant capacity and varying\nresponses to oxidative stress by the microenvironment are thought\nto influence carcinogenesis. 137  Lastly,\nincreased cellular proliferation does not exclusively lead to carcinogenesis,\nhealthy regeneration can occur as well. Therefore, sustained perturbation\nof signaling, ultimately impairing normal regeneration and homeostasis,\nis expected to be fundamental in malignant transformation. Hazard\nassessment will thus have to qualitatively and quantitatively cover\nthe KERs in the proposed AOP network and consider tissue-specific\ndifferences in sensitivity.",
