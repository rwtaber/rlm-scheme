  "abstract": "Heavy metals are highly nephrotoxic and may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease. However, the potential roles of inflammatory responses and dietary patterns in the relationship between heavy metals and kidney disease remain underexplored. This study examines the heavy metal exposure-inflammatory response-kidney function decline pathway and the modulating role of dietary patterns in heavy metal-induced kidney damage. Results from generalized linear models, restricted cubic spline models, and weighted quantile regression models show that exposure to individual heavy metals in blood and urine (except urinary mercury) is associated with a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and an increase in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) and Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI) (except for blood mercury, urinary lead, and urinary mercury). Among blood heavy metals, lead (0.502) and cadmium (0.640) have the greatest impact on eGFR and UACR, respectively. Among urinary heavy metals, cadmium (0.463) and lead (0.902) have the greatest impact on eGFR and UACR, respectively. Moreover, exposure to multiple heavy metals in blood is linked to lower eGFR and higher UACR and SIRI, while exposure to multiple heavy metals in urine is associated with decreased eGFR, UACR, and SIRI. SIRI and Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) are significantly associated with decreased eGFR and increased UACR, whereas Healthy Eating Index 2020 (HEI2020) is significantly associated with increased eGFR and decreased UACR. Mediation analysis indicates that individual or combined exposure to blood or urinary heavy metals affects kidney function via SIRI, with stronger mediation effects for individual heavy metal exposure than for combined exposure. Moderation analysis shows that DII exacerbates the nephrotoxicity of blood or urinary heavy metals, while HEI2020 has an ameliorating effect.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-25320-w.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has become a major public health concern due to its high incidence, poor prognosis, and significant association with morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases1. Individuals with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or the presence of kidney damage markers (such as proteinuria) are defined as CKD patients2. The global burden of CKD is increasing annually, and it is projected to become the fifth leading cause of death worldwide by 20401. Therefore, exploring ways to mitigate or eliminate modifiable risk factors for CKD risk is of particular importance. Exposure to environmental pollutants significantly increases the risk of CKD, with heavy metal pollution being of particular concern—among which cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) are prioritized for this study, based on three core lines of evidence: their strong kidney-targeted toxicity, widespread environmental presence, and well-documented associations with CKD pathogenesis3–5. Studies have shown that these heavy metals can cause acute and chronic kidney injury by disrupting kidney cell function, inducing oxidative stress, and damaging cellular structures6,7. More seriously, cadmium, lead, and mercury are widely used in industrial production and are characterized by environmental persistence and bioaccumulation8. These heavy metals accumulate in target organs such as the kidneys through biomagnification in the food chain9. Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown that individuals exposed long-term to environments contaminated with cadmium, lead, and other heavy metals have a significantly higher risk of developing CKD than the general population10. And, heavy metal pollution often occurs in combination, and combined exposure to heavy metals can have synergistic effects on kidney function, with toxicity levels reaching several times that of individual exposure11. Inflammatory responses are a defensive physiological mechanism of the body against injury or infection12. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that heavy metal exposure can induce inflammatory responses, thereby increasing the risk of all-cause mortality13,14. For example, He et al. found that both individual and combined exposures to heavy metals significantly elevated systemic inflammation levels, based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)13. Similarly, Zhao et al. demonstrated a strong correlation between elevated serum manganese levels and increased immune-inflammatory levels using data from 3,355 participants in Guangxi, China14. Meanwhile, patients with CKD often exhibit systemic inflammatory status15. Gu et al. further indicated that higher levels of systemic inflammatory responses in CKD patients are associated with increased mortality risk16. Therefore, we hypothesize that systemic inflammatory responses may mediate the association between heavy metal exposure and CKD. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation to be validated and elucidated. In addition, dietary patterns may play a significant modulatory role in the impact of heavy metals on CKD17. Studies often use standardized tools like the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and the 2020 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2020) to assess the relationship between dietary patterns and health outcomes18. The DII scores diets based on their pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory potential, reflecting the impact of food components on specific inflammatory biomarkers19. The HEI-2020 evaluates dietary quality by measuring adherence to recommended intake levels. A wealth of evidence supports the protective effects of healthy dietary patterns on kidney health20. Hu et al. conducted a cohort study that found individuals with kidney dysfunction who adhered to a healthier diet had significantly reduced mortality risk21. Relevant studies have also shown that healthy dietary patterns can significantly reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease by decreasing dietary acid load, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses19,22,23. For example, nutrients abundant in plant-based diets, such as lutein and phytochemicals, can protect the kidneys by inhibiting inflammation-related signaling pathways24. Conversely, pro-inflammatory diets, typically rich in saturated and trans fats, refined carbohydrates, and high-salt foods, can activate inflammatory pathways and increase the risk of kidney function impairment25,26. These diets are linked to elevated levels of chronic inflammation markers like C-reactive protein and IL-6, which are key drivers of CKD progression26–28. Additionally, pro-inflammatory diets may lead to insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction, further burdening the kidneys27. Exploring the potential relationship between heavy metal exposure, inflammatory responses, and kidney function decline, along with the modulating role of dietary patterns, is crucial. It reveals the mechanisms underlying the interplay between environmental and dietary factors and informs the development of dietary intervention strategies to mitigate the risk of heavy metal-induced kidney damage. To this end, this study utilizes cross-sectional data from seven consecutive cycles of the NHANES database from 2005 to 2018. This study integrates generalized linear models (GLM), restricted cubic spline models (RCS), weighted quantile sum regression models (WQS), and causal mediation models to explore the potential relationship between heavy metal exposure, inflammatory responses, and kidney function decline. Additionally, this study assesses the modulatory role of dietary patterns in this relationship using interaction models."

      "text": "The original dataset for this study was derived from the NHANES data collected between 2005 and 2018, which had been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)29. The NCHS Ethics Review Board (ERB) Protocol Number or Description corresponding to Survey Name and Date is shown in the \" Ethics approval and consent to participate” section under “Declarations”. Prior to data collection, all participants or their guardians had signed written informed consent forms30. To ensure data integrity and accuracy, participants with missing data for heavy metal levels in blood or urine, renal function indicators (urine albumin, urine creatinine, serum creatinine, etc.), and inflammatory indicators (neutrophil count, monocyte count, and lymphocyte count) were excluded. In addition, we also excluded participants with missing values for covariates (such as ethnicity, alcohol consumption status, smoking status, blood pressure, blood glucose, etc.) and dietary data, as well as pregnant women (Fig. S1). After the aforementioned data preprocessing, a total of 9047 participants were included in the study. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria (Urine albumin/creatinine ratio, UACR) were used to assess the kidney function of the study population. The eGFR formula was as follows31:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$eGFR=175\\times {Serum~ creatinine}^{-1.154}\\times {Age}^{-0.203}\\times 0.742 \\left[if ~female\\right]\\times 1.212 \\left[if~ black\\right]$$\\end{document} Age is the age of the participant in years. The UACR was calculated using the following formula:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$UACR=UA/UC$$\\end{document} UA is the urine albumin. UC is the urine creatinine. To further validate the robustness of the study findings, participants with an eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² are defined as having kidney dysfunction, and those with a UACR > 30 mg/g are defined as having proteinuria. Sensitivity analyses were then conducted based on these criteria8. Cadmium, lead, and mercury can accumulate in the human body over the long term, with primary deposition in the kidneys. This bioaccumulation leads to a gradual increase in the concentration of these heavy metals in the body, thereby triggering chronic toxic effects. Numerous studies have shown a significant association between exposure to cadmium, lead, and mercury and kidney damage. In addition, epidemiological studies have also shown that people who are long-term exposed to environments contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium and lead have a significantly higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) than the general population. This study selected three common heavy metal pollutants (cadmium, lead, and mercury) for investigation. Given that kidney function encompasses multiple critical physiological functions, including filtration and excretion, this study selected indicators that included both blood levels of cadmium, lead, and mercury (reflecting heavy metal exposure and kidney filtration efficiency) and corresponding urine heavy metal levels (indicating kidney excretion capacity and clearance efficiency). This multidimensional indicator system aims to more accurately elucidate the complex relationship between heavy metal pollution and kidney function. The laboratory methods for measuring heavy metals are available on the NHANES website. The determination of blood heavy metal levels was performed by directly measuring whole blood specimens via mass spectrometry after simple dilution. Detailed laboratory procedures can be found in the relevant NHANES documents (wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2017/labmethods/PBCD-J-PBY-J-R-MET-508.pdf). For urine samples, single random urine sample collection was adopted. Urine heavy metal levels were also directly measured by mass spectrometry following simple dilution. Detailed information on urine collection methods and laboratory procedures for urine heavy metal measurement can be accessed via the following NHANES links (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2015/labmethods/UTAS_UTASS_UM_UMS_I_MET.PDF, https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2015/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf). The Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI) is one of the important indicators currently used to reflect systemic inflammatory status32. It assesses the degree of inflammation by considering the ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood. Therefore, this study selected SIRI as an indicator of participants’ inflammatory levels.\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$SIRI=NC\\times MC/LC$$\\end{document} NC is neutrophil count, MC is monocyte count, and LC is lymphocyte count. The DII and HEI-2020 are key indicators for evaluating an individual’s overall dietary inflammatory status and dietary health33. When used together, they provide a more precise assessment of diet quality and help explore the role of dietary patterns in the relationship between heavy metals and kidney function34. The DII focuses on the inflammatory potential of a diet. It is calculated based on an individual’s intake of 45 specific dietary components, including macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and specific food components such as caffeine and curcumin26. Each component is assigned an “inflammatory effect score” based on the strength of the scientific evidence linking it to inflammatory biomarkers27. An individual’s intake is compared to a global standard database to obtain a z-score, which is then multiplied by the effect score and summed to yield a continuous score26,27. A negative score (the lower, the better) indicates an anti-inflammatory diet, while a positive score (the higher, the worse) suggests a pro-inflammatory diet25. The HEI-2020 assesses dietary adherence on based the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans and comprises 13 components (nine adequacy components: total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, legumes/vegetables, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood/plant protein, fatty acids; and four moderation components: refined grains, sodium, added sugars, saturated fats)17,23. Adequacy component scores increase with higher intake up to a maximum, while moderation component scores increase with lower intake up to a maximum17. The total score, ranging from 0 to 100, is the sum of all component scores, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to healthy dietary recommendations23. In this study, both the DII and HEI-2020 indices were calculated using data from two 24-h dietary recall interviews provided by the NHANES database. The dietary data were standardized and the indices computed using the dietaryindex package in R. Fasting glucose was determined by the hexokinase method; glycated hemoglobin was isolated and quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); serum cotinine was detected using isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ID-HPLC-MS/MS) after extraction; triglycerides were measured by the GPO-POD enzymatic method; low-density lipoprotein content was mainly calculated using the Friedewald formula; and high-density lipoprotein content has been measured by the enzymatic method since 2013. Detailed laboratory measurement methods can be found in NHANES (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2015/labmethods/UTAS_UTASS_UM_UMS_I_MET.PDF). All laboratory data in this study were generated under the stringent quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) framework of the NHANES project. Regarding the internal laboratory analyses, QC measures were rigorously implemented: for urinary testing, the laboratory utilized negative and low-positive controls for monitoring at the start of each testing day and whenever a new reagent lot was introduced, with all critical parameters tracked via a dedicated software module. For blood CBC analysis, the laboratory adhered to a strict QC protocol, running commercial controls each shift and every 24 h, and maintained a comprehensive procedure for troubleshooting and corrective actions when controls were out of range. Simultaneously, NHANES has established overarching and rigorous QA/QC mechanisms throughout the entire process: QA activities cover critical steps such as equipment calibration and personnel training; while QC measures during data collection include automatic software editing and verification, data analysis of technician performance, and quality control for sample testing and processing to ensure survey accuracy. This multi-level, systematic QA/QC system collectively guarantees the high reliability and trustworthiness of all biomarker data in this study. Relevant details can be viewed on the NHANES website (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/AnalyticGuidelines.aspx). Given that eGFR calculation includes age and sex, which may introduce bias in the relationship between heavy metals and eGFR, and to ensure consistency in the relationship between heavy metals and UACR, this study excluded age and sex as covariates. Referring to relevant literature, this study ultimately included 12 covariates, categorized as sociodemographic factors: race, BMI (< 25 kg/m² for normal/underweight, ≥ 30 kg/m² for obesity, and the rest for overweight), rate of household income and poverty, and marital status; and health-related factors: physical activity (cycling or walking for ≥ 10 min per week), dietary supplement intake, alcohol consumption status (daily alcohol intake > 30 g for men or > 20 g for women), smoking status (serum cotinine ≥ 10 ng/mL), blood glucose (fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL or glycohemoglobin ≥ 6.5%), blood pressure (systolic pressure > 130 mm Hg or diastolic pressure > 85 mm Hg), blood lipids (triglycerides > 150 mg/dL, LDL > 100 mg/dL, HDL < 40 mg/dL for men or < 50 mg/dL for women), gout, and diabetes (based on medical history)35. This study used frequency (percentage) and mean (standard deviation) to describe categorical and continuous variables, respectively, and constructed a correlation plot (Fig. S2) to illustrate the relationships and distributions of blood heavy metals, urine heavy metals, SIRI, DII, HEI2020, eGFR, and UACR. To ensure the accuracy of the regression results and reduce the impact of extreme values, logarithmic transformations are applied to blood and urine heavy metals. First, GLM are used to examine the associations of individual blood and urine heavy metal exposures, SIRI, DII, and HEI2020 with eGFR and UACR. WQS regression models are used to determine the impacts of blood or urine heavy metal combined exposures on SIRI, eGFR, and UACR. RCS model is used to explore the exposure-response (E-R) relationships of blood or urine heavy metal individual or combined exposures, SIRI, DII, and HEI2020 with eGFR and UACR. To delve deeper into the study’s assumptions, we employed causal mediation analysis grounded in the counterfactual framework (executed via the mediation package in R) to evaluate the mediating role of SIRI in the associations between individual and mixed exposures to blood/urine heavy metals and eGFR/UACR. Additionally, we used moderation analysis models (constructed with the interactions package in R) to explore the moderating effects of DII and HEI-2020 in these associations. Finally, to validate the robustness of the study findings, participants are stratified into normal and abnormal kidney function groups based on whether eGFR was > 90 mL/min/1.73 m², and into proteinuria and non-proteinuria groups based on whether UACR was ≥ 30 mg/g. Subsequently, GLM are constructed to verify the relationships between blood or urine heavy metal individual or combined exposures, SIRI, DII, HEI2020, and the risks of kidney dysfunction and proteinuria."

Finally, to validate the robustness of the study findings, participants are stratified into normal and abnormal kidney function groups based on whether eGFR was > 90 mL/min/1.73 m², and into proteinuria and non-proteinuria groups based on whether UACR was ≥ 30 mg/g. Subsequently, GLM are constructed to verify the relationships between blood or urine heavy metal individual or combined exposures, SIRI, DII, HEI2020, and the risks of kidney dysfunction and proteinuria."

As shown in Fig. 1a, blood cadmium, lead, and mercury are all associated with decreased eGFR. After adjusting for all covariates, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed levels of blood cadmium, lead, and mercury is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 5.22 (β = -5.22; 95% CI: -5.99, -4.45), 7.56 (β = -7.56; 95% CI: -8.30, -6.81), and 0.91 (β = -0.91; 95% CI: -1.43, -0.38), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b, blood cadmium and lead are associated with increased UACR, while blood mercury is associated with decreased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed levels of blood cadmium and lead is associated with an increase in UACR of 10.01 (95% CI: 0.21, 19.80) and 12.62 (95% CI: 3.74, 21.50), respectively, while blood mercury is associated with a decrease in UACR of 5.13 (β = -5.13; 95% CI: -9.43, -0.17). As shown in Fig. 1c, urine cadmium and lead are associated with decreased eGFR, while urine mercury is associated with increased eGFR. After adjusting for all covariates, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed levels of urine cadmium and lead is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 3.00 (β = -3.00; 95% CI: -3.51, -2.49) and 0.82 (β = -0.82; 95% CI: -1.37, -0.27), respectively, while urine mercury is associated with an increase in eGFR of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.85). As shown in Fig. 1d, urine lead and mercury are associated with decreased UACR, while urine cadmium is associated with increased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed levels of urine lead and mercury is associated with a decrease in UACR of 13.86 (β = -13.86; 95% CI: -20.29, -7.47) and 10.16 (β = -10.16; 95% CI: -15.56, -4.76), respectively, while urine cadmium is associated with an increase in UACR of 7.99 (95% CI: 1.62, 14.35).

Notes The baseline model was not controlled for any covariates, adjusted model 1 was used to control for sociodemographic variables, and adjusted model 2 was used to control for all covariates. The same as follows. As shown in Fig. 2, the exposure–response (E-R) functions of eGFR with log-transformed blood cadmium, lead, and mercury were all nonlinear (P for TOTAL < 0.05, P for Nonlinear < 0.05). The E-R relationship between log-transformed blood cadmium and eGFR was approximately U-shaped (decrease-increase), while the relationship between log-transformed blood lead and eGFR showed a decreasing trend. The E-R function between log-transformed blood mercury and eGFR showed a wave-like pattern (increase-decrease-increase). The E-R function of eGFR with log-transformed urine cadmium was nonlinear, while those with urine lead and mercury were linear (P for TOTAL < 0.05, P for Nonlinear > 0.05). The E-R relationships between log-transformed urine cadmium and lead with eGFR both showed decreasing trends, while the function between log-transformed urine mercury and eGFR showed an increasing trend. Fig. 2E-R relationship of heavy metals in blood and urine on eGFR. E-R relationship of heavy metals in blood and urine on eGFR. As shown in Fig. 3, the E-R function of UACR with log-transformed blood cadmium was nonlinear, while those with blood lead and mercury were linear. The E-R relationship between log-transformed blood cadmium and UACR was approximately U-shaped and wave-like (decrease-increase-decrease), while the relationship between log-transformed blood lead and UACR showed an increasing trend. The E-R function between log-transformed blood mercury and UACR showed an inverted U-shaped pattern (increase-decrease). The E-R functions of UACR with log-transformed urine cadmium, lead, and mercury were linear. The E-R relationship between log-transformed urine cadmium and UACR showed an increasing trend, while those for urine lead and mercury showed the opposite. Fig. 3E-R relationship of heavy metals in blood and urine on UACR. E-R relationship of heavy metals in blood and urine on UACR. As shown in Fig. 4, among blood heavy metals, lead had the greatest impact on eGFR (0.502), while cadmium had the greatest impact on UACR (0.640). In urine heavy metals, cadmium had the greatest impact on eGFR (0.463), while lead had the greatest impact on UACR (0.902). Fig. 4WQS weights of cadmium, lead and mercury in blood or urine on eGFR and UACR, respectively. WQS weights of cadmium, lead and mercury in blood or urine on eGFR and UACR, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, combined exposure to blood heavy metals or urine heavy metals is associated with decreased eGFR. Moreover, combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with increased UACR, while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with decreased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 10.57 (β = -10.57; 95% CI: -11.57, -9.57), while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 3.04 (β = -3.04; 95% CI: -3.57, -2.51). Combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with an increase in UACR of 16.42 (95% CI: -3.047, 29.80), while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with a decrease in UACR of 14.77 (β = -14.77; 95% CI: -21.63, -7.90). As shown in Fig. S3, the E-R functions of combined exposure to blood or urine heavy metals with eGFR were both nonlinear and showed decreasing trends. For UACR, the E-R function of combined exposure to blood heavy metals showed a linear increasing trend, while that of combined exposure to urine heavy metals showed a linear decreasing trend. Fig. 5Relationship of mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR and UACR. Relationship of mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR and UACR. As shown in Fig. 6, after adjusting for all covariates, log-transformed blood cadmium (β = 0.03; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.06) and blood lead (β = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.07) are associated with increased SIRI, while blood mercury (β = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.03) is associated with decreased SIRI. The relationship between urine cadmium and SIRI is not significant, while urine lead (β = -0.03; 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01) and urine mercury (β = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.06, -0.02) are associated with decreased SIRI. Combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with increased SIRI, while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with decreased SIRI. Figure S4 shows that the E-R functions of blood cadmium and urine cadmium with SIRI are both U-shaped, indicating a decrease followed by an increase. The E-R functions of blood lead and blood mercury with SIRI show linear increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. The E-R functions of urine lead and urine mercury with SIRI show nonlinear increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. Additionally, Fig. S5 shows that the E-R functions of combined exposure to blood heavy metals with SIRI are nonlinear and showed increasing trends, while those of combined exposure to urine heavy metals with SIRI show decreasing followed by increasing trends. Fig. 6Relationship between single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on SIRI. Relationship between single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on SIRI. As shown in Figs. 7, S6, and S7, both SIRI and DII are significantly associated with decreased eGFR and increased UACR. Conversely, higher HEI2020 scores are associated with increased eGFR and decreased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, SIRI is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 2.74 (β = -2.74; 95% CI: -3.32, -2.16), while DII is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 0.71 (β = -0.71; 95% CI: -1.01, -0.41). SIRI and DII are also associated with increased UACR by 16.15 (95% CI: 9.36, 22.93) and 4.16 (95% CI: 0.53, 7.80), respectively. In contrast, HEI2020 is associated with an increase in eGFR of 1.99 (95% CI: 1.32, 2.67) and a decrease in UACR of 11.49 (β = -11.49; 95% CI: -20.33, -2.65). Fig. 7The impact of SIRI, DII and HEI2020 on eGFR and UACR. The impact of SIRI, DII and HEI2020 on eGFR and UACR. As shown in Figs. 8 and S8, SIRI has significant mediating effects in the relationships between individual or combined exposures to blood or urine cadmium, lead, and mercury and eGFR or UACR. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between blood cadmium, lead, and mercury and eGFR were 6.40% (95% CI: 4.91%, 7.16%), 11.29% (95% CI: 6.49%, 23.23%), and 13.46% (95% CI: 8.67%, 65.00%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between blood cadmium, lead, and mercury and UACR were 20.92% (95% CI: 11.56%, 68.10%), 7.67% (95% CI: 4.46%, 24.60%), and 14.85% (95% CI: 4.27%, 41.56%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between urine cadmium, lead, and mercury and eGFR were 3.55% (95% CI: 2.74%, 4.48%), 7.24% (95% CI: 3.64%, 8.97%), and 15.24% (95% CI: -91.99%, 45.37%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between urine cadmium, lead, and mercury and UACR were 5.88% (95% CI: 2.88%, 17.68%), -5.61% (95% CI: -6.78%, -2.35. Fig. 8SIRI mediates the effects of single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR or UACR. SIRI mediates the effects of single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR or UACR. As shown in Fig. 9, the interactions between blood cadmium, blood lead, blood mercury and the DII significantly affect eGFR. Specifically, an increase in DII exacerbates the negative effects of blood cadmium and lead on eGFR, while the effect on blood mercury is not significant. Additionally, the interactions between urine cadmium and mercury and DII also significantly affect eGFR, indicating that DII enhances the effects of urine cadmium and mercury on eGFR. However, the interaction between urine lead and DII does not significantly affect eGFR. Figure S9 shows that an increase in DII significantly exacerbates the increase in UACR caused by blood lead and the decrease in UACR caused by urine mercury. Figure S10 indicates that DII increases the effects of combined exposure to blood heavy metals on the decrease in eGFR and the increase in UACR. Additionally, DII exacerbates the negative effects of combined exposure to urine heavy metals on eGFR. Fig. 9DII modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. DII modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. As shown in Fig. 10, HEI2020 has a positive effect on mitigating the negative impact of blood or urine cadmium on eGFR. Additionally, HEI2020 attenuates the potential promoting effect of urine mercury on eGFR. The interactions between other heavy metals and HEI2020 do not significantly affect eGFR. HEI2020 reduces the UACR decline caused by urine lead, but the interactions between other heavy metals and HEI2020 do not significantly affect UACR (Fig. S11). HEI2020 significantly mitigates the negative impact of combined exposure to blood heavy metals on eGFR (Fig. S12). Although HEI2020 reduces the UACR increase caused by combined exposure to blood heavy metals, this effect is not significant. Additionally, HEI2020 has a positive effect on mitigating the negative impact of combined exposure to urine heavy metals on eGFR but also attenuates the mitigating effect on UACR. Fig. 10HEI2020 modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. HEI2020 modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. The analyses in Figs. S13, S14, S15, and S16 show that exposure to blood cadmium and lead is significantly associated with an increased risk of kidney dysfunction. Additionally, exposure to blood heavy metals, except for mercury, is also associated with an increased risk of proteinuria. In contrast, exposure to urine heavy metals, except for cadmium, is associated with a reduced risk of proteinuria. Further analyses show that SIRI and DII are significantly associated with increased risks of kidney dysfunction and proteinuria, while HEI2020 is associated with a reduced risk of proteinuria. Notably, combined exposure to blood and urine heavy metals is also significantly associated with an increased risk of kidney dysfunction. These findings are consistent with the above results, indicating that the study conclusions are robust."

      "text": "Heavy metal exposure poses a significant threat to human health, particularly kidney function. Therefore, it is crucial to explore ways to mitigate or eliminate the impact of heavy metals on the risk of CKD. Meanwhile, systemic inflammation and dietary patterns may play a role in the relationship between heavy metal exposure and kidney function, but the specific effects have not been fully explored. Therefore, this study, based on NHANES data, investigates the potential relationships between heavy metal exposure, inflammatory responses, and decreased kidney function, as well as the modulating effects of dietary patterns. This study utilized GLM, RCS, and WQS) to investigate the effects of individual and combined exposures to blood or urine heavy metals on eGFR and their E-R relationships, aiming to explore the nephrotoxicity of heavy metals and potential prognostic approaches. We found that individual exposure to blood heavy metals, combined exposure to blood heavy metals, and combined exposure to urine heavy metals were all associated with a nonlinear decline in eGFR. Urine cadmium and lead were negatively correlated with eGFR, with eGFR showing a nonlinear decline with increasing urine cadmium and a linear decline with increasing urine lead. eGFR increased linearly with increasing urine mercury. The findings that individual exposure to blood heavy metals, combined exposure to blood heavy metals, and combined exposure to urine heavy metals were negatively correlated with eGFR are consistent with previous studies36,37. However, the relationship between urine heavy metal exposure and eGFR is more complex and differs from previous findings. Jin R. et al. found a positive association between urine cadmium, lead, mercury, and eGFR using NHANES data from 2003 to 201238. A similar conclusion was reached by Sanders, A. P39. Interestingly, this study found that the relationships between blood or urine heavy metal exposures and UACR are also complex. Blood cadmium, lead, and combined blood heavy metals were positively correlated with UACR, with UACR increasing linearly with increasing blood lead and combined blood heavy metals, while the E-R function between blood cadmium and UACR showed a decrease-increase-decrease pattern. UACR increased linearly with increasing urine cadmium but decreased linearly with increasing urine lead, mercury, and combined urine heavy metals. These findings are consistent with those of Tsai et al., who found that high blood lead and high urine cadmium levels were significantly associated with proteinuria, further highlighting the potential role of heavy metal exposure in kidney damage and proteinuria40. Additionally, the relationships between urine cadmium, lead, and UACR are consistent with the findings of Yin et al. and Huang et al.41,42. WQS regression analysis reveals significant differences in the effects of blood and urine heavy metal mixtures on kidney function, with distinct biological mechanisms: in blood exposure, lead’s high weight (0.502) for eGFR arises from its direct activation of the glomerular NADPH oxidase-ROS pathway, inducing podocyte apoptosis, while cadmium’s dominant weight (0.640) for UACR stems from its specific downregulation of podocyte nephrin, disrupting the filtration barrier43–45. In urine exposure, cadmium’s leading weight (0.463) for eGFR reflects its chronic tubular accumulation inhibiting Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase, and lead’s extreme weight (0.902) for UACR unveils a “dose-dependent pseudo-protection” mechanism - low-dose urinary lead stimulates metallothionein to chelate free ions, reducing glomerular damage via antioxidant effects (echoing SIRI’s negative mediating effect of -5.61%)46,47. Mercury’s low weight in both matrices is due to its form-specific targeting (neurotropic organic mercury in blood, freely filtered organic mercury in urine that spares podocytes)48,49. In essence, blood mixture weights highlight acute glomerular inflammation and oxidative stress, while urine mixture weights reflect chronic cadmium accumulation and adaptive lead detoxification, functionally dissociating tubular and glomerular impacts. The complex relationships between blood or urine heavy metal exposures and eGFR and UACR may be related to the interplay of multiple mechanisms50. Blood or urine heavy metal concentrations may reflect different exposure time windows, with blood heavy metal levels more indicative of recent exposure due to significant influences from recent diet and environmental contact51,52, whereas urine heavy metals are closely related to long-term cumulative exposure50. Heavy metal excretion is a continuous process, and urine heavy metal levels can reflect the body’s cumulative burden over a longer period to some extent53,54. This difference in exposure time windows may lead to distinct characteristics in the relationships between blood and urine heavy metals and eGFR and UACR. Additionally, this may also be related to the fact that heavy metals can affect kidney function through multiple pathways and that different heavy metals have distinct nephrotoxicity pathways11,41,55. For example, cadmium primarily accumulates in the kidney cortex, causing proximal tubular injury, while lead mainly affects the glomerular filtration barrier through oxidative stress induction56–58. The differences between organic and inorganic forms of mercury may be associated with bidirectional biological effects47,59. Notably, UACR, as a sensitive indicator of glomerular injury, may be mechanistically dissociated from the filtration function reflected by eGFR, suggesting that heavy metal exposure may affect different kidney functional units through different pathophysiological pathways41,56,60. Moreover, antagonistic/synergistic interactions among metals and population-specific factors (such as systemic inflammatory status and nutritional status) may also be associated with kidney function impairment6,41,61,62. Numerous studies have revealed a significant association between heavy metal exposure and enhanced inflammatory responses in humans14. Further analyses indicate that intensified inflammatory responses not only negatively impact normal physiological functions but also significantly increase the risk of kidney dysfunction63–65. As an example, the research by Liu Qi et al. discovered that heavy metals can promote inflammatory responses, thereby increasing the risk of chronic kidney disease, particularly in women66. Moreover, the study conducted by Kuei-Hau Luo et al. also indicated that metal exposure might lead to kidney damage by affecting the inflammatory factor TNF-α67. Therefore, this study posits that long-term heavy metal exposure not only directly jeopardizes kidney health but also increases the risk of kidney dysfunction by inducing systemic inflammatory responses. The results of this study show that blood cadmium and lead are significantly associated with increased SIRI, while blood mercury and urine lead and mercury are significantly associated with decreased SIRI. Additionally, combined exposure to blood heavy metals significantly increases SIRI, while combined exposure to urine heavy metals shows a nonlinear trend of first decreasing and then increasing SIRI. Moreover, SIRI is associated with decreased eGFR and increased UACR. Subsequently, causal mediation models confirmed that SIRI significantly mediates the relationships between individual or combined exposures to blood and urine heavy metals and eGFR and UACR. This conclusion may be related to the multisystem toxicity of heavy metal exposure in humans52. The promotion of inflammatory responses by blood heavy metal exposure may be related to the oxidative stress and cytotoxicity they induce in the body9,68,69. Heavy metals may trigger systemic inflammatory responses by disrupting intracellular antioxidant systems, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activating inflammatory signaling pathways7,68,70,71. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of urine heavy metal exposure on inflammatory responses may be related to kidney excretory functions and detoxification mechanisms for heavy metals38,72. As the primary organ for heavy metal excretion, the kidneys may reduce their toxicity in the body by excreting some heavy metals through urine72. When exposed to a single heavy metal, SIRI exhibits a positive mediating effect in the association between blood/urine heavy metals and eGFR/UACR. Nevertheless, upon combined exposure to blood heavy metals, this positive mediating effect of SIRI on eGFR (3.46%) and UACR (10.09%) is attenuated, which may be attributed to antagonistic interactions among metals or the saturation of inflammatory pathways73,74. Regarding combined exposure to urine heavy metals, a marked divergence in their impact on eGFR and UACR is observed: a weak positive mediation for eGFR (4.55%) and a strong negative mediation for UACR (-7.95%). This is in accordance with nonlinear toxicity mechanisms. At low concentrations, the kidneys’ excretory function takes the lead, and detoxification suppresses inflammation (resulting in an initial decrease in SIRI); however, when exposure levels rise, the cumulative toxicity of heavy metals surpasses the kidneys’ detoxification capacity, activating inflammatory responses and consequently inducing kidney impairment75,76. Overall, SIRI primarily amplifies inflammation in the relationship between single heavy metal exposure and kidney function indicators, particularly in blood heavy metal exposure. Yet, in combined exposure scenarios, especially with urine heavy metals, SIRI’s mediating role is regulated by both excretory detoxification and toxicity accumulation8,35. Urinary lead shows a negative mediation in both single and combined exposures, indicating it may ease inflammatory responses through temporary immune suppression or kidney compensation77. Also, the strong negative effect of combined urine heavy metal exposure on UACR (-7.95%) further supports the idea that low-dose heavy metals can trigger protective physiological responses. This pattern uncovers the multi-system interactive nature of heavy metal nephrotoxicity. On the one hand, heavy metals activate systemic inflammatory responses via oxidative stress, directly causing kidney damage; on the other hand, this effect is finely tuned by kidney excretion and dose-dependent detoxification mechanisms. This study constructed interaction models to further explore the role of population nutritional status (DII and HEI2020) in the relationship between heavy metal exposure and kidney function. An increase in DII exacerbates the negative impact of individual and combined heavy metal exposures on eGFR and the positive impact on UACR. Conversely, an increase in HEI2020 significantly alleviates the adverse effects of heavy metal exposure on kidney function. This may be related to the dietary characteristics reflected by DII and HEI2020 and their impact on systemic inflammatory responses and metabolic functions33,34. A higher DII dietary pattern may enhance the nephrotoxicity of heavy metals by exacerbating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses12,18. For example, pro-inflammatory diets may lead to elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, thereby weakening the body’s detoxification capacity against heavy metals and the kidney’s self-repair ability, and further exacerbating the negative impact of heavy metal exposure on eGFR and the positive impact on UACR20,78. Conversely, a higher HEI-2020 dietary pattern is typically associated with diets rich in antioxidants, dietary fiber, and essential nutrients, which may mitigate the toxicity of heavy metals through multiple mechanisms79,80. For example, antioxidants can neutralize heavy metal-induced oxidative stress, dietary fiber aids in the excretion of heavy metals, and essential nutrients support the body’s metabolic functions and kidney repair capacity81,82. Therefore, an increase in HEI-2020 may alleviate the adverse effects of heavy metal exposure on kidney function by improving overall nutritional status and metabolic functions80. Additionally, the modulatory effects of DII and HEI-2020 on the relationship between heavy metal exposure and kidney function may also be related to their impact on the gut microbiota83–85. Pro-inflammatory diets may disrupt the balance of gut microbiota, leading to impaired gut barrier function and increased absorption and toxicity of heavy metals83. In contrast, healthy diets may help maintain gut microbiota homeostasis, enhance gut barrier function, and reduce the absorption and toxicity of heavy metals85. This study innovatively integrated blood (reflecting short-term exposure) and urine (reflecting long-term accumulation) heavy metal assessments to uncover their distinct impacts on kidney function indicators (eGFR and UACR). Using generalized linear models, restricted cubic splines, weighted quantile regression, and causal mediation models, we explored the “heavy metal exposure-inflammatory response-kidney function decline” pathway, revealing the complex mechanisms linking heavy metal exposure to kidney dysfunction via inflammation. We also employed moderation analysis models to assess dietary patterns’ role, finding that healthy diets may protect against heavy metal nephrotoxicity, while pro-inflammatory diets may exacerbate it. Consequently, reducing heavy metal exposure through environmental monitoring, targeting key inflammatory pathways in heavy metal nephrotoxicity, and promoting healthy diets constitute three vital evidence-based strategies for lowering the risk of kidney function impairment in exposed populations, holding great importance for public health improvement. However, this cross-sectional study has limitations. It cannot establish the temporal sequence of heavy metal exposure, inflammation, and chronic kidney disease, only allowing for the exploration of mediating effects between them; longitudinal studies are needed to clarify causality. Heavy metal exposure assessment relied on single blood/urine samples, which may not accurately reflect long-term exposure. Although acceptable due to heavy metals’ long half-lives, future research should use multiple samples or biomarkers for better long-term exposure assessment. The 24-h dietary recall method also has limitations, likely underestimating the associations between DII, HEI-2020, eGFR, UACR, and heavy metal exposure. Additionally, despite adjusting for key confounders using DAGs and multivariable models, unconsidered confounders might still influence results. Finally, the specific mechanisms of kidney function decline as a mediator remain unclear and require further laboratory investigation."

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nChronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has become a major public health concern due to its high incidence, poor prognosis, and significant association with morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases1. Individuals with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or the presence of kidney damage markers (such as proteinuria) are defined as CKD patients2. The global burden of CKD is increasing annually, and it is projected to become the fifth leading cause of death worldwide by 20401. Therefore, exploring ways to mitigate or eliminate modifiable risk factors for CKD risk is of particular importance. Exposure to environmental pollutants significantly increases the risk of CKD, with heavy metal pollution being of particular concern—among which cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) are prioritized for this study, based on three core lines of evidence: their strong kidney-targeted toxicity, widespread environmental presence, and well-documented associations with CKD pathogenesis3–5. Studies have shown that these heavy metals can cause acute and chronic kidney injury by disrupting kidney cell function, inducing oxidative stress, and damaging cellular structures6,7. More seriously, cadmium, lead, and mercury are widely used in industrial production and are characterized by environmental persistence and bioaccumulation8. These heavy metals accumulate in target organs such as the kidneys through biomagnification in the food chain9. Moreover, epidemiological studies have shown that individuals exposed long-term to environments contaminated with cadmium, lead, and other heavy metals have a significantly higher risk of developing CKD than the general population10. And, heavy metal pollution often occurs in combination, and combined exposure to heavy metals can have synergistic effects on kidney function, with toxicity levels reaching several times that of individual exposure11. Inflammatory responses are a defensive physiological mechanism of the body against injury or infection12. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that heavy metal exposure can induce inflammatory responses, thereby increasing the risk of all-cause mortality13,14. For example, He et al. found that both individual and combined exposures to heavy metals significantly elevated systemic inflammation levels, based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)13. Similarly, Zhao et al. demonstrated a strong correlation between elevated serum manganese levels and increased immune-inflammatory levels using data from 3,355 participants in Guangxi, China14. Meanwhile, patients with CKD often exhibit systemic inflammatory status15. Gu et al. further indicated that higher levels of systemic inflammatory responses in CKD patients are associated with increased mortality risk16. Therefore, we hypothesize that systemic inflammatory responses may mediate the association between heavy metal exposure and CKD. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation to be validated and elucidated. In addition, dietary patterns may play a significant modulatory role in the impact of heavy metals on CKD17. Studies often use standardized tools like the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and the 2020 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2020) to assess the relationship between dietary patterns and health outcomes18. The DII scores diets based on their pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory potential, reflecting the impact of food components on specific inflammatory biomarkers19. The HEI-2020 evaluates dietary quality by measuring adherence to recommended intake levels. A wealth of evidence supports the protective effects of healthy dietary patterns on kidney health20. Hu et al. conducted a cohort study that found individuals with kidney dysfunction who adhered to a healthier diet had significantly reduced mortality risk21. Relevant studies have also shown that healthy dietary patterns can significantly reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease by decreasing dietary acid load, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses19,22,23. For example, nutrients abundant in plant-based diets, such as lutein and phytochemicals, can protect the kidneys by inhibiting inflammation-related signaling pathways24. Conversely, pro-inflammatory diets, typically rich in saturated and trans fats, refined carbohydrates, and high-salt foods, can activate inflammatory pathways and increase the risk of kidney function impairment25,26. These diets are linked to elevated levels of chronic inflammation markers like C-reactive protein and IL-6, which are key drivers of CKD progression26–28. Additionally, pro-inflammatory diets may lead to insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction, further burdening the kidneys27. Exploring the potential relationship between heavy metal exposure, inflammatory responses, and kidney function decline, along with the modulating role of dietary patterns, is crucial. It reveals the mechanisms underlying the interplay between environmental and dietary factors and informs the development of dietary intervention strategies to mitigate the risk of heavy metal-induced kidney damage. To this end, this study utilizes cross-sectional data from seven consecutive cycles of the NHANES database from 2005 to 2018. This study integrates generalized linear models (GLM), restricted cubic spline models (RCS), weighted quantile sum regression models (WQS), and causal mediation models to explore the potential relationship between heavy metal exposure, inflammatory responses, and kidney function decline. Additionally, this study assesses the modulatory role of dietary patterns in this relationship using interaction models.\n\n## Methods\nThe original dataset for this study was derived from the NHANES data collected between 2005 and 2018, which had been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)29. The NCHS Ethics Review Board (ERB) Protocol Number or Description corresponding to Survey Name and Date is shown in the \" Ethics approval and consent to participate” section under “Declarations”. Prior to data collection, all participants or their guardians had signed written informed consent forms30. To ensure data integrity and accuracy, participants with missing data for heavy metal levels in blood or urine, renal function indicators (urine albumin, urine creatinine, serum creatinine, etc.), and inflammatory indicators (neutrophil count, monocyte count, and lymphocyte count) were excluded. In addition, we also excluded participants with missing values for covariates (such as ethnicity, alcohol consumption status, smoking status, blood pressure, blood glucose, etc.) and dietary data, as well as pregnant women (Fig. S1). After the aforementioned data preprocessing, a total of 9047 participants were included in the study. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria (Urine albumin/creatinine ratio, UACR) were used to assess the kidney function of the study population. The eGFR formula was as follows31:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$eGFR=175\\times {Serum~ creatinine}^{-1.154}\\times {Age}^{-0.203}\\times 0.742 \\left[if ~female\\right]\\times 1.212 \\left[if~ black\\right]$$\\end{document} Age is the age of the participant in years. The UACR was calculated using the following formula:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$UACR=UA/UC$$\\end{document} UA is the urine albumin. UC is the urine creatinine. To further validate the robustness of the study findings, participants with an eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² are defined as having kidney dysfunction, and those with a UACR > 30 mg/g are defined as having proteinuria. Sensitivity analyses were then conducted based on these criteria8. Cadmium, lead, and mercury can accumulate in the human body over the long term, with primary deposition in the kidneys. This bioaccumulation leads to a gradual increase in the concentration of these heavy metals in the body, thereby triggering chronic toxic effects. Numerous studies have shown a significant association between exposure to cadmium, lead, and mercury and kidney damage. In addition, epidemiological studies have also shown that people who are long-term exposed to environments contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium and lead have a significantly higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) than the general population. This study selected three common heavy metal pollutants (cadmium, lead, and mercury) for investigation. Given that kidney function encompasses multiple critical physiological functions, including filtration and excretion, this study selected indicators that included both blood levels of cadmium, lead, and mercury (reflecting heavy metal exposure and kidney filtration efficiency) and corresponding urine heavy metal levels (indicating kidney excretion capacity and clearance efficiency). This multidimensional indicator system aims to more accurately elucidate the complex relationship between heavy metal pollution and kidney function. The laboratory methods for measuring heavy metals are available on the NHANES website. The determination of blood heavy metal levels was performed by directly measuring whole blood specimens via mass spectrometry after simple dilution. Detailed laboratory procedures can be found in the relevant NHANES documents (wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2017/labmethods/PBCD-J-PBY-J-R-MET-508.pdf). For urine samples, single random urine sample collection was adopted. Urine heavy metal levels were also directly measured by mass spectrometry following simple dilution. Detailed information on urine collection methods and laboratory procedures for urine heavy metal measurement can be accessed via the following NHANES links (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2015/labmethods/UTAS_UTASS_UM_UMS_I_MET.PDF, https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2015/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf). The Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI) is one of the important indicators currently used to reflect systemic inflammatory status32. It assesses the degree of inflammation by considering the ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood. Therefore, this study selected SIRI as an indicator of participants’ inflammatory levels.\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$SIRI=NC\\times MC/LC$$\\end{document} NC is neutrophil count, MC is monocyte count, and LC is lymphocyte count. The DII and HEI-2020 are key indicators for evaluating an individual’s overall dietary inflammatory status and dietary health33. When used together, they provide a more precise assessment of diet quality and help explore the role of dietary patterns in the relationship between heavy metals and kidney function34. The DII focuses on the inflammatory potential of a diet. It is calculated based on an individual’s intake of 45 specific dietary components, including macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, and specific food components such as caffeine and curcumin26. Each component is assigned an “inflammatory effect score” based on the strength of the scientific evidence linking it to inflammatory biomarkers27. An individual’s intake is compared to a global standard database to obtain a z-score, which is then multiplied by the effect score and summed to yield a continuous score26,27. A negative score (the lower, the better) indicates an anti-inflammatory diet, while a positive score (the higher, the worse) suggests a pro-inflammatory diet25. The HEI-2020 assesses dietary adherence on based the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans and comprises 13 components (nine adequacy components: total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, legumes/vegetables, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood/plant protein, fatty acids; and four moderation components: refined grains, sodium, added sugars, saturated fats)17,23. Adequacy component scores increase with higher intake up to a maximum, while moderation component scores increase with lower intake up to a maximum17. The total score, ranging from 0 to 100, is the sum of all component scores, with higher scores indicating greater adherence to healthy dietary recommendations23. In this study, both the DII and HEI-2020 indices were calculated using data from two 24-h dietary recall interviews provided by the NHANES database. The dietary data were standardized and the indices computed using the dietaryindex package in R. Fasting glucose was determined by the hexokinase method; glycated hemoglobin was isolated and quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); serum cotinine was detected using isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ID-HPLC-MS/MS) after extraction; triglycerides were measured by the GPO-POD enzymatic method; low-density lipoprotein content was mainly calculated using the Friedewald formula; and high-density lipoprotein content has been measured by the enzymatic method since 2013. Detailed laboratory measurement methods can be found in NHANES (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/public/2015/labmethods/UTAS_UTASS_UM_UMS_I_MET.PDF). All laboratory data in this study were generated under the stringent quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) framework of the NHANES project. Regarding the internal laboratory analyses, QC measures were rigorously implemented: for urinary testing, the laboratory utilized negative and low-positive controls for monitoring at the start of each testing day and whenever a new reagent lot was introduced, with all critical parameters tracked via a dedicated software module. For blood CBC analysis, the laboratory adhered to a strict QC protocol, running commercial controls each shift and every 24 h, and maintained a comprehensive procedure for troubleshooting and corrective actions when controls were out of range. Simultaneously, NHANES has established overarching and rigorous QA/QC mechanisms throughout the entire process: QA activities cover critical steps such as equipment calibration and personnel training; while QC measures during data collection include automatic software editing and verification, data analysis of technician performance, and quality control for sample testing and processing to ensure survey accuracy. This multi-level, systematic QA/QC system collectively guarantees the high reliability and trustworthiness of all biomarker data in this study. Relevant details can be viewed on the NHANES website (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/AnalyticGuidelines.aspx). Given that eGFR calculation includes age and sex, which may introduce bias in the relationship between heavy metals and eGFR, and to ensure consistency in the relationship between heavy metals and UACR, this study excluded age and sex as covariates. Referring to relevant literature, this study ultimately included 12 covariates, categorized as sociodemographic factors: race, BMI (< 25 kg/m² for normal/underweight, ≥ 30 kg/m² for obesity, and the rest for overweight), rate of household income and poverty, and marital status; and health-related factors: physical activity (cycling or walking for ≥ 10 min per week), dietary supplement intake, alcohol consumption status (daily alcohol intake > 30 g for men or > 20 g for women), smoking status (serum cotinine ≥ 10 ng/mL), blood glucose (fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL or glycohemoglobin ≥ 6.5%), blood pressure (systolic pressure > 130 mm Hg or diastolic pressure > 85 mm Hg), blood lipids (triglycerides > 150 mg/dL, LDL > 100 mg/dL, HDL < 40 mg/dL for men or < 50 mg/dL for women), gout, and diabetes (based on medical history)35. This study used frequency (percentage) and mean (standard deviation) to describe categorical and continuous variables, respectively, and constructed a correlation plot (Fig. S2) to illustrate the relationships and distributions of blood heavy metals, urine heavy metals, SIRI, DII, HEI2020, eGFR, and UACR. To ensure the accuracy of the regression results and reduce the impact of extreme values, logarithmic transformations are applied to blood and urine heavy metals. First, GLM are used to examine the associations of individual blood and urine heavy metal exposures, SIRI, DII, and HEI2020 with eGFR and UACR. WQS regression models are used to determine the impacts of blood or urine heavy metal combined exposures on SIRI, eGFR, and UACR. RCS model is used to explore the exposure-response (E-R) relationships of blood or urine heavy metal individual or combined exposures, SIRI, DII, and HEI2020 with eGFR and UACR. To delve deeper into the study’s assumptions, we employed causal mediation analysis grounded in the counterfactual framework (executed via the mediation package in R) to evaluate the mediating role of SIRI in the associations between individual and mixed exposures to blood/urine heavy metals and eGFR/UACR. Additionally, we used moderation analysis models (constructed with the interactions package in R) to explore the moderating effects of DII and HEI-2020 in these associations. Finally, to validate the robustness of the study findings, participants are stratified into normal and abnormal kidney function groups based on whether eGFR was > 90 mL/min/1.73 m², and into proteinuria and non-proteinuria groups based on whether UACR was ≥ 30 mg/g. Subsequently, GLM are constructed to verify the relationships between blood or urine heavy metal individual or combined exposures, SIRI, DII, HEI2020, and the risks of kidney dysfunction and proteinuria.\n\n## Study population\nThe original dataset for this study was derived from the NHANES data collected between 2005 and 2018, which had been approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)29.

RCS model is used to explore the exposure-response (E-R) relationships of blood or urine heavy metal individual or combined exposures, SIRI, DII, and HEI2020 with eGFR and UACR. To delve deeper into the study’s assumptions, we employed causal mediation analysis grounded in the counterfactual framework (executed via the mediation package in R) to evaluate the mediating role of SIRI in the associations between individual and mixed exposures to blood/urine heavy metals and eGFR/UACR. Additionally, we used moderation analysis models (constructed with the interactions package in R) to explore the moderating effects of DII and HEI-2020 in these associations. Finally, to validate the robustness of the study findings, participants are stratified into normal and abnormal kidney function groups based on whether eGFR was > 90 mL/min/1.73 m², and into proteinuria and non-proteinuria groups based on whether UACR was ≥ 30 mg/g. Subsequently, GLM are constructed to verify the relationships between blood or urine heavy metal individual or combined exposures, SIRI, DII, HEI2020, and the risks of kidney dysfunction and proteinuria.\n\n## Results\nAs shown in Table 1, the 9,047 participants in this study had a mean age of 48.7 years; 49.5% were male and 50.5% were female. The most prevalent categories for race, marital status, and BMI were non-Hispanic White (45.1%), married (50.5%), and obese (38.8%), respectively. The mean rate of household income and poverty was 2.54 ± 1.62. Among the study population, 23.3% were smokers, 38.3% were alcohol consumers, 49.8% used dietary supplements, and 26% engaged in physical activity. The prevalence of health issues among participants included abnormal blood glucose (12.6%), abnormal blood pressure (33.5%), abnormal blood lipids (65.1%), gout (7.3%), and diabetes (12.4%). The concentrations of cadmium, lead, and mercury in blood were 0.49 (0.55), 1.52 (1.49), and 1.52 (1.49), respectively, while those in urine were 0.36 (0.43), 0.67 (1.21), and 0.62 (1.45), respectively. The mean values of UACR, SIRI, DII, and HEI were 42.72 (284.94), 1.22 (0.86), 1.15 (1.70), and 51.23 (12.12), respectively. As shown in Fig. S2, significant correlations were observed among blood and urine heavy metals (cadmium, lead, mercury), and varying degrees of associations were also found between heavy metals, eGFR, UACR, SIRI, DII, and HEI.

As shown in Fig. 1a, blood cadmium, lead, and mercury are all associated with decreased eGFR. After adjusting for all covariates, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed levels of blood cadmium, lead, and mercury is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 5.22 (β = -5.22; 95% CI: -5.99, -4.45), 7.56 (β = -7.56; 95% CI: -8.30, -6.81), and 0.91 (β = -0.91; 95% CI: -1.43, -0.38), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b, blood cadmium and lead are associated with increased UACR, while blood mercury is associated with decreased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed levels of blood cadmium and lead is associated with an increase in UACR of 10.01 (95% CI: 0.21, 19.80) and 12.62 (95% CI: 3.74, 21.50), respectively, while blood mercury is associated with a decrease in UACR of 5.13 (β = -5.13; 95% CI: -9.43, -0.17). As shown in Fig. 1c, urine cadmium and lead are associated with decreased eGFR, while urine mercury is associated with increased eGFR. After adjusting for all covariates, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed levels of urine cadmium and lead is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 3.00 (β = -3.00; 95% CI: -3.51, -2.49) and 0.82 (β = -0.82; 95% CI: -1.37, -0.27), respectively, while urine mercury is associated with an increase in eGFR of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.85). As shown in Fig. 1d, urine lead and mercury are associated with decreased UACR, while urine cadmium is associated with increased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, each one-unit increase in the log-transformed levels of urine lead and mercury is associated with a decrease in UACR of 13.86 (β = -13.86; 95% CI: -20.29, -7.47) and 10.16 (β = -10.16; 95% CI: -15.56, -4.76), respectively, while urine cadmium is associated with an increase in UACR of 7.99 (95% CI: 1.62, 14.35).

Notes The baseline model was not controlled for any covariates, adjusted model 1 was used to control for sociodemographic variables, and adjusted model 2 was used to control for all covariates. The same as follows. As shown in Fig. 2, the exposure–response (E-R) functions of eGFR with log-transformed blood cadmium, lead, and mercury were all nonlinear (P for TOTAL < 0.05, P for Nonlinear < 0.05). The E-R relationship between log-transformed blood cadmium and eGFR was approximately U-shaped (decrease-increase), while the relationship between log-transformed blood lead and eGFR showed a decreasing trend. The E-R function between log-transformed blood mercury and eGFR showed a wave-like pattern (increase-decrease-increase). The E-R function of eGFR with log-transformed urine cadmium was nonlinear, while those with urine lead and mercury were linear (P for TOTAL < 0.05, P for Nonlinear > 0.05). The E-R relationships between log-transformed urine cadmium and lead with eGFR both showed decreasing trends, while the function between log-transformed urine mercury and eGFR showed an increasing trend.

As shown in Fig. 3, the E-R function of UACR with log-transformed blood cadmium was nonlinear, while those with blood lead and mercury were linear. The E-R relationship between log-transformed blood cadmium and UACR was approximately U-shaped and wave-like (decrease-increase-decrease), while the relationship between log-transformed blood lead and UACR showed an increasing trend. The E-R function between log-transformed blood mercury and UACR showed an inverted U-shaped pattern (increase-decrease). The E-R functions of UACR with log-transformed urine cadmium, lead, and mercury were linear. The E-R relationship between log-transformed urine cadmium and UACR showed an increasing trend, while those for urine lead and mercury showed the opposite.

As shown in Fig. 4, among blood heavy metals, lead had the greatest impact on eGFR (0.502), while cadmium had the greatest impact on UACR (0.640). In urine heavy metals, cadmium had the greatest impact on eGFR (0.463), while lead had the greatest impact on UACR (0.902). Fig. 4WQS weights of cadmium, lead and mercury in blood or urine on eGFR and UACR, respectively. WQS weights of cadmium, lead and mercury in blood or urine on eGFR and UACR, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, combined exposure to blood heavy metals or urine heavy metals is associated with decreased eGFR. Moreover, combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with increased UACR, while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with decreased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 10.57 (β = -10.57; 95% CI: -11.57, -9.57), while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 3.04 (β = -3.04; 95% CI: -3.57, -2.51). Combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with an increase in UACR of 16.42 (95% CI: -3.047, 29.80), while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with a decrease in UACR of 14.77 (β = -14.77; 95% CI: -21.63, -7.90). As shown in Fig. S3, the E-R functions of combined exposure to blood or urine heavy metals with eGFR were both nonlinear and showed decreasing trends. For UACR, the E-R function of combined exposure to blood heavy metals showed a linear increasing trend, while that of combined exposure to urine heavy metals showed a linear decreasing trend. Fig. 5Relationship of mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR and UACR. Relationship of mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR and UACR. As shown in Fig. 6, after adjusting for all covariates, log-transformed blood cadmium (β = 0.03; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.06) and blood lead (β = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.07) are associated with increased SIRI, while blood mercury (β = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.03) is associated with decreased SIRI. The relationship between urine cadmium and SIRI is not significant, while urine lead (β = -0.03; 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01) and urine mercury (β = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.06, -0.02) are associated with decreased SIRI. Combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with increased SIRI, while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with decreased SIRI. Figure S4 shows that the E-R functions of blood cadmium and urine cadmium with SIRI are both U-shaped, indicating a decrease followed by an increase. The E-R functions of blood lead and blood mercury with SIRI show linear increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. The E-R functions of urine lead and urine mercury with SIRI show nonlinear increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. Additionally, Fig. S5 shows that the E-R functions of combined exposure to blood heavy metals with SIRI are nonlinear and showed increasing trends, while those of combined exposure to urine heavy metals with SIRI show decreasing followed by increasing trends. Fig. 6Relationship between single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on SIRI. Relationship between single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on SIRI. As shown in Figs. 7, S6, and S7, both SIRI and DII are significantly associated with decreased eGFR and increased UACR. Conversely, higher HEI2020 scores are associated with increased eGFR and decreased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, SIRI is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 2.74 (β = -2.74; 95% CI: -3.32, -2.16), while DII is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 0.71 (β = -0.71; 95% CI: -1.01, -0.41). SIRI and DII are also associated with increased UACR by 16.15 (95% CI: 9.36, 22.93) and 4.16 (95% CI: 0.53, 7.80), respectively. In contrast, HEI2020 is associated with an increase in eGFR of 1.99 (95% CI: 1.32, 2.67) and a decrease in UACR of 11.49 (β = -11.49; 95% CI: -20.33, -2.65). Fig. 7The impact of SIRI, DII and HEI2020 on eGFR and UACR. The impact of SIRI, DII and HEI2020 on eGFR and UACR. As shown in Figs. 8 and S8, SIRI has significant mediating effects in the relationships between individual or combined exposures to blood or urine cadmium, lead, and mercury and eGFR or UACR. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between blood cadmium, lead, and mercury and eGFR were 6.40% (95% CI: 4.91%, 7.16%), 11.29% (95% CI: 6.49%, 23.23%), and 13.46% (95% CI: 8.67%, 65.00%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between blood cadmium, lead, and mercury and UACR were 20.92% (95% CI: 11.56%, 68.10%), 7.67% (95% CI: 4.46%, 24.60%), and 14.85% (95% CI: 4.27%, 41.56%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between urine cadmium, lead, and mercury and eGFR were 3.55% (95% CI: 2.74%, 4.48%), 7.24% (95% CI: 3.64%, 8.97%), and 15.24% (95% CI: -91.99%, 45.37%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between urine cadmium, lead, and mercury and UACR were 5.88% (95% CI: 2.88%, 17.68%), -5.61% (95% CI: -6.78%, -2.35. Fig. 8SIRI mediates the effects of single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR or UACR. SIRI mediates the effects of single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR or UACR. As shown in Fig. 9, the interactions between blood cadmium, blood lead, blood mercury and the DII significantly affect eGFR. Specifically, an increase in DII exacerbates the negative effects of blood cadmium and lead on eGFR, while the effect on blood mercury is not significant. Additionally, the interactions between urine cadmium and mercury and DII also significantly affect eGFR, indicating that DII enhances the effects of urine cadmium and mercury on eGFR. However, the interaction between urine lead and DII does not significantly affect eGFR. Figure S9 shows that an increase in DII significantly exacerbates the increase in UACR caused by blood lead and the decrease in UACR caused by urine mercury. Figure S10 indicates that DII increases the effects of combined exposure to blood heavy metals on the decrease in eGFR and the increase in UACR. Additionally, DII exacerbates the negative effects of combined exposure to urine heavy metals on eGFR. Fig. 9DII modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. DII modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. As shown in Fig. 10, HEI2020 has a positive effect on mitigating the negative impact of blood or urine cadmium on eGFR. Additionally, HEI2020 attenuates the potential promoting effect of urine mercury on eGFR. The interactions between other heavy metals and HEI2020 do not significantly affect eGFR. HEI2020 reduces the UACR decline caused by urine lead, but the interactions between other heavy metals and HEI2020 do not significantly affect UACR (Fig. S11). HEI2020 significantly mitigates the negative impact of combined exposure to blood heavy metals on eGFR (Fig. S12). Although HEI2020 reduces the UACR increase caused by combined exposure to blood heavy metals, this effect is not significant. Additionally, HEI2020 has a positive effect on mitigating the negative impact of combined exposure to urine heavy metals on eGFR but also attenuates the mitigating effect on UACR. Fig. 10HEI2020 modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. HEI2020 modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. The analyses in Figs. S13, S14, S15, and S16 show that exposure to blood cadmium and lead is significantly associated with an increased risk of kidney dysfunction. Additionally, exposure to blood heavy metals, except for mercury, is also associated with an increased risk of proteinuria. In contrast, exposure to urine heavy metals, except for cadmium, is associated with a reduced risk of proteinuria. Further analyses show that SIRI and DII are significantly associated with increased risks of kidney dysfunction and proteinuria, while HEI2020 is associated with a reduced risk of proteinuria. Notably, combined exposure to blood and urine heavy metals is also significantly associated with an increased risk of kidney dysfunction. These findings are consistent with the above results, indicating that the study conclusions are robust.\n\n## Descriptive analysis\nAs shown in Table 1, the 9,047 participants in this study had a mean age of 48.7 years; 49.5% were male and 50.5% were female. The most prevalent categories for race, marital status, and BMI were non-Hispanic White (45.1%), married (50.5%), and obese (38.8%), respectively. The mean rate of household income and poverty was 2.54 ± 1.62. Among the study population, 23.3% were smokers, 38.3% were alcohol consumers, 49.8% used dietary supplements, and 26% engaged in physical activity. The prevalence of health issues among participants included abnormal blood glucose (12.6%), abnormal blood pressure (33.5%), abnormal blood lipids (65.1%), gout (7.3%), and diabetes (12.4%). The concentrations of cadmium, lead, and mercury in blood were 0.49 (0.55), 1.52 (1.49), and 1.52 (1.49), respectively, while those in urine were 0.36 (0.43), 0.67 (1.21), and 0.62 (1.45), respectively.

In urine heavy metals, cadmium had the greatest impact on eGFR (0.463), while lead had the greatest impact on UACR (0.902).

As shown in Fig. 5, combined exposure to blood heavy metals or urine heavy metals is associated with decreased eGFR. Moreover, combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with increased UACR, while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with decreased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 10.57 (β = -10.57; 95% CI: -11.57, -9.57), while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 3.04 (β = -3.04; 95% CI: -3.57, -2.51).

As shown in Fig. S3, the E-R functions of combined exposure to blood or urine heavy metals with eGFR were both nonlinear and showed decreasing trends. For UACR, the E-R function of combined exposure to blood heavy metals showed a linear increasing trend, while that of combined exposure to urine heavy metals showed a linear decreasing trend.

The relationship between urine cadmium and SIRI is not significant, while urine lead (β = -0.03; 95% CI: -0.05, -0.01) and urine mercury (β = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.06, -0.02) are associated with decreased SIRI. Combined exposure to blood heavy metals is associated with increased SIRI, while combined exposure to urine heavy metals is associated with decreased SIRI. Figure S4 shows that the E-R functions of blood cadmium and urine cadmium with SIRI are both U-shaped, indicating a decrease followed by an increase. The E-R functions of blood lead and blood mercury with SIRI show linear increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. The E-R functions of urine lead and urine mercury with SIRI show nonlinear increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. Additionally, Fig. S5 shows that the E-R functions of combined exposure to blood heavy metals with SIRI are nonlinear and showed increasing trends, while those of combined exposure to urine heavy metals with SIRI show decreasing followed by increasing trends.

Conversely, higher HEI2020 scores are associated with increased eGFR and decreased UACR. After adjusting for all covariates, SIRI is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 2.74 (β = -2.74; 95% CI: -3.32, -2.16), while DII is associated with a decrease in eGFR of 0.71 (β = -0.71; 95% CI: -1.01, -0.41). SIRI and DII are also associated with increased UACR by 16.15 (95% CI: 9.36, 22.93) and 4.16 (95% CI: 0.53, 7.80), respectively. In contrast, HEI2020 is associated with an increase in eGFR of 1.99 (95% CI: 1.32, 2.67) and a decrease in UACR of 11.49 (β = -11.49; 95% CI: -20.33, -2.65).

The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between blood cadmium, lead, and mercury and eGFR were 6.40% (95% CI: 4.91%, 7.16%), 11.29% (95% CI: 6.49%, 23.23%), and 13.46% (95% CI: 8.67%, 65.00%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between blood cadmium, lead, and mercury and UACR were 20.92% (95% CI: 11.56%, 68.10%), 7.67% (95% CI: 4.46%, 24.60%), and 14.85% (95% CI: 4.27%, 41.56%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between urine cadmium, lead, and mercury and eGFR were 3.55% (95% CI: 2.74%, 4.48%), 7.24% (95% CI: 3.64%, 8.97%), and 15.24% (95% CI: -91.99%, 45.37%), respectively. The mediating effects of SIRI in the relationships between urine cadmium, lead, and mercury and UACR were 5.88% (95% CI: 2.88%, 17.68%), -5.61% (95% CI: -6.78%, -2.35. Fig. 8SIRI mediates the effects of single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR or UACR. SIRI mediates the effects of single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR or UACR.\n\n## DII and HEI2020 modulate the relationship between single or mixed exposure to heavy metals in blood or urine and eGFR and UACR\nAs shown in Fig. 9, the interactions between blood cadmium, blood lead, blood mercury and the DII significantly affect eGFR. Specifically, an increase in DII exacerbates the negative effects of blood cadmium and lead on eGFR, while the effect on blood mercury is not significant. Additionally, the interactions between urine cadmium and mercury and DII also significantly affect eGFR, indicating that DII enhances the effects of urine cadmium and mercury on eGFR. However, the interaction between urine lead and DII does not significantly affect eGFR. Figure S9 shows that an increase in DII significantly exacerbates the increase in UACR caused by blood lead and the decrease in UACR caused by urine mercury. Figure S10 indicates that DII increases the effects of combined exposure to blood heavy metals on the decrease in eGFR and the increase in UACR. Additionally, DII exacerbates the negative effects of combined exposure to urine heavy metals on eGFR. Fig. 9DII modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. DII modulate the effects of heavy metals in blood or urine on eGFR. As shown in Fig. 10, HEI2020 has a positive effect on mitigating the negative impact of blood or urine cadmium on eGFR. Additionally, HEI2020 attenuates the potential promoting effect of urine mercury on eGFR. The interactions between other heavy metals and HEI2020 do not significantly affect eGFR. HEI2020 reduces the UACR decline caused by urine lead, but the interactions between other heavy metals and HEI2020 do not significantly affect UACR (Fig. S11). HEI2020 significantly mitigates the negative impact of combined exposure to blood heavy metals on eGFR (Fig. S12). Although HEI2020 reduces the UACR increase caused by combined exposure to blood heavy metals, this effect is not significant. Additionally, HEI2020 has a positive effect on mitigating the negative impact of combined exposure to urine heavy metals on eGFR but also attenuates the mitigating effect on UACR.

S13, S14, S15, and S16 show that exposure to blood cadmium and lead is significantly associated with an increased risk of kidney dysfunction. Additionally, exposure to blood heavy metals, except for mercury, is also associated with an increased risk of proteinuria. In contrast, exposure to urine heavy metals, except for cadmium, is associated with a reduced risk of proteinuria. Further analyses show that SIRI and DII are significantly associated with increased risks of kidney dysfunction and proteinuria, while HEI2020 is associated with a reduced risk of proteinuria. Notably, combined exposure to blood and urine heavy metals is also significantly associated with an increased risk of kidney dysfunction. These findings are consistent with the above results, indicating that the study conclusions are robust.\n\n## Discussion\nHeavy metal exposure poses a significant threat to human health, particularly kidney function. Therefore, it is crucial to explore ways to mitigate or eliminate the impact of heavy metals on the risk of CKD. Meanwhile, systemic inflammation and dietary patterns may play a role in the relationship between heavy metal exposure and kidney function, but the specific effects have not been fully explored. Therefore, this study, based on NHANES data, investigates the potential relationships between heavy metal exposure, inflammatory responses, and decreased kidney function, as well as the modulating effects of dietary patterns. This study utilized GLM, RCS, and WQS) to investigate the effects of individual and combined exposures to blood or urine heavy metals on eGFR and their E-R relationships, aiming to explore the nephrotoxicity of heavy metals and potential prognostic approaches. We found that individual exposure to blood heavy metals, combined exposure to blood heavy metals, and combined exposure to urine heavy metals were all associated with a nonlinear decline in eGFR. Urine cadmium and lead were negatively correlated with eGFR, with eGFR showing a nonlinear decline with increasing urine cadmium and a linear decline with increasing urine lead. eGFR increased linearly with increasing urine mercury. The findings that individual exposure to blood heavy metals, combined exposure to blood heavy metals, and combined exposure to urine heavy metals were negatively correlated with eGFR are consistent with previous studies36,37. However, the relationship between urine heavy metal exposure and eGFR is more complex and differs from previous findings. Jin R. et al. found a positive association between urine cadmium, lead, mercury, and eGFR using NHANES data from 2003 to 201238. A similar conclusion was reached by Sanders, A. P39. Interestingly, this study found that the relationships between blood or urine heavy metal exposures and UACR are also complex. Blood cadmium, lead, and combined blood heavy metals were positively correlated with UACR, with UACR increasing linearly with increasing blood lead and combined blood heavy metals, while the E-R function between blood cadmium and UACR showed a decrease-increase-decrease pattern. UACR increased linearly with increasing urine cadmium but decreased linearly with increasing urine lead, mercury, and combined urine heavy metals. These findings are consistent with those of Tsai et al., who found that high blood lead and high urine cadmium levels were significantly associated with proteinuria, further highlighting the potential role of heavy metal exposure in kidney damage and proteinuria40. Additionally, the relationships between urine cadmium, lead, and UACR are consistent with the findings of Yin et al. and Huang et al.41,42. WQS regression analysis reveals significant differences in the effects of blood and urine heavy metal mixtures on kidney function, with distinct biological mechanisms: in blood exposure, lead’s high weight (0.502) for eGFR arises from its direct activation of the glomerular NADPH oxidase-ROS pathway, inducing podocyte apoptosis, while cadmium’s dominant weight (0.640) for UACR stems from its specific downregulation of podocyte nephrin, disrupting the filtration barrier43–45. In urine exposure, cadmium’s leading weight (0.463) for eGFR reflects its chronic tubular accumulation inhibiting Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase, and lead’s extreme weight (0.902) for UACR unveils a “dose-dependent pseudo-protection” mechanism - low-dose urinary lead stimulates metallothionein to chelate free ions, reducing glomerular damage via antioxidant effects (echoing SIRI’s negative mediating effect of -5.61%)46,47. Mercury’s low weight in both matrices is due to its form-specific targeting (neurotropic organic mercury in blood, freely filtered organic mercury in urine that spares podocytes)48,49. In essence, blood mixture weights highlight acute glomerular inflammation and oxidative stress, while urine mixture weights reflect chronic cadmium accumulation and adaptive lead detoxification, functionally dissociating tubular and glomerular impacts. The complex relationships between blood or urine heavy metal exposures and eGFR and UACR may be related to the interplay of multiple mechanisms50. Blood or urine heavy metal concentrations may reflect different exposure time windows, with blood heavy metal levels more indicative of recent exposure due to significant influences from recent diet and environmental contact51,52, whereas urine heavy metals are closely related to long-term cumulative exposure50. Heavy metal excretion is a continuous process, and urine heavy metal levels can reflect the body’s cumulative burden over a longer period to some extent53,54. This difference in exposure time windows may lead to distinct characteristics in the relationships between blood and urine heavy metals and eGFR and UACR. Additionally, this may also be related to the fact that heavy metals can affect kidney function through multiple pathways and that different heavy metals have distinct nephrotoxicity pathways11,41,55. For example, cadmium primarily accumulates in the kidney cortex, causing proximal tubular injury, while lead mainly affects the glomerular filtration barrier through oxidative stress induction56–58. The differences between organic and inorganic forms of mercury may be associated with bidirectional biological effects47,59. Notably, UACR, as a sensitive indicator of glomerular injury, may be mechanistically dissociated from the filtration function reflected by eGFR, suggesting that heavy metal exposure may affect different kidney functional units through different pathophysiological pathways41,56,60. Moreover, antagonistic/synergistic interactions among metals and population-specific factors (such as systemic inflammatory status and nutritional status) may also be associated with kidney function impairment6,41,61,62. Numerous studies have revealed a significant association between heavy metal exposure and enhanced inflammatory responses in humans14. Further analyses indicate that intensified inflammatory responses not only negatively impact normal physiological functions but also significantly increase the risk of kidney dysfunction63–65. As an example, the research by Liu Qi et al. discovered that heavy metals can promote inflammatory responses, thereby increasing the risk of chronic kidney disease, particularly in women66. Moreover, the study conducted by Kuei-Hau Luo et al. also indicated that metal exposure might lead to kidney damage by affecting the inflammatory factor TNF-α67. Therefore, this study posits that long-term heavy metal exposure not only directly jeopardizes kidney health but also increases the risk of kidney dysfunction by inducing systemic inflammatory responses. The results of this study show that blood cadmium and lead are significantly associated with increased SIRI, while blood mercury and urine lead and mercury are significantly associated with decreased SIRI. Additionally, combined exposure to blood heavy metals significantly increases SIRI, while combined exposure to urine heavy metals shows a nonlinear trend of first decreasing and then increasing SIRI. Moreover, SIRI is associated with decreased eGFR and increased UACR. Subsequently, causal mediation models confirmed that SIRI significantly mediates the relationships between individual or combined exposures to blood and urine heavy metals and eGFR and UACR. This conclusion may be related to the multisystem toxicity of heavy metal exposure in humans52. The promotion of inflammatory responses by blood heavy metal exposure may be related to the oxidative stress and cytotoxicity they induce in the body9,68,69. Heavy metals may trigger systemic inflammatory responses by disrupting intracellular antioxidant systems, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and activating inflammatory signaling pathways7,68,70,71. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of urine heavy metal exposure on inflammatory responses may be related to kidney excretory functions and detoxification mechanisms for heavy metals38,72. As the primary organ for heavy metal excretion, the kidneys may reduce their toxicity in the body by excreting some heavy metals through urine72. When exposed to a single heavy metal, SIRI exhibits a positive mediating effect in the association between blood/urine heavy metals and eGFR/UACR. Nevertheless, upon combined exposure to blood heavy metals, this positive mediating effect of SIRI on eGFR (3.46%) and UACR (10.09%) is attenuated, which may be attributed to antagonistic interactions among metals or the saturation of inflammatory pathways73,74. Regarding combined exposure to urine heavy metals, a marked divergence in their impact on eGFR and UACR is observed: a weak positive mediation for eGFR (4.55%) and a strong negative mediation for UACR (-7.95%). This is in accordance with nonlinear toxicity mechanisms. At low concentrations, the kidneys’ excretory function takes the lead, and detoxification suppresses inflammation (resulting in an initial decrease in SIRI); however, when exposure levels rise, the cumulative toxicity of heavy metals surpasses the kidneys’ detoxification capacity, activating inflammatory responses and consequently inducing kidney impairment75,76. Overall, SIRI primarily amplifies inflammation in the relationship between single heavy metal exposure and kidney function indicators, particularly in blood heavy metal exposure. Yet, in combined exposure scenarios, especially with urine heavy metals, SIRI’s mediating role is regulated by both excretory detoxification and toxicity accumulation8,35. Urinary lead shows a negative mediation in both single and combined exposures, indicating it may ease inflammatory responses through temporary immune suppression or kidney compensation77. Also, the strong negative effect of combined urine heavy metal exposure on UACR (-7.95%) further supports the idea that low-dose heavy metals can trigger protective physiological responses. This pattern uncovers the multi-system interactive nature of heavy metal nephrotoxicity. On the one hand, heavy metals activate systemic inflammatory responses via oxidative stress, directly causing kidney damage; on the other hand, this effect is finely tuned by kidney excretion and dose-dependent detoxification mechanisms. This study constructed interaction models to further explore the role of population nutritional status (DII and HEI2020) in the relationship between heavy metal exposure and kidney function. An increase in DII exacerbates the negative impact of individual and combined heavy metal exposures on eGFR and the positive impact on UACR. Conversely, an increase in HEI2020 significantly alleviates the adverse effects of heavy metal exposure on kidney function. This may be related to the dietary characteristics reflected by DII and HEI2020 and their impact on systemic inflammatory responses and metabolic functions33,34. A higher DII dietary pattern may enhance the nephrotoxicity of heavy metals by exacerbating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses12,18. For example, pro-inflammatory diets may lead to elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, thereby weakening the body’s detoxification capacity against heavy metals and the kidney’s self-repair ability, and further exacerbating the negative impact of heavy metal exposure on eGFR and the positive impact on UACR20,78. Conversely, a higher HEI-2020 dietary pattern is typically associated with diets rich in antioxidants, dietary fiber, and essential nutrients, which may mitigate the toxicity of heavy metals through multiple mechanisms79,80. For example, antioxidants can neutralize heavy metal-induced oxidative stress, dietary fiber aids in the excretion of heavy metals, and essential nutrients support the body’s metabolic functions and kidney repair capacity81,82. Therefore, an increase in HEI-2020 may alleviate the adverse effects of heavy metal exposure on kidney function by improving overall nutritional status and metabolic functions80. Additionally, the modulatory effects of DII and HEI-2020 on the relationship between heavy metal exposure and kidney function may also be related to their impact on the gut microbiota83–85. Pro-inflammatory diets may disrupt the balance of gut microbiota, leading to impaired gut barrier function and increased absorption and toxicity of heavy metals83. In contrast, healthy diets may help maintain gut microbiota homeostasis, enhance gut barrier function, and reduce the absorption and toxicity of heavy metals85. This study innovatively integrated blood (reflecting short-term exposure) and urine (reflecting long-term accumulation) heavy metal assessments to uncover their distinct impacts on kidney function indicators (eGFR and UACR). Using generalized linear models, restricted cubic splines, weighted quantile regression, and causal mediation models, we explored the “heavy metal exposure-inflammatory response-kidney function decline” pathway, revealing the complex mechanisms linking heavy metal exposure to kidney dysfunction via inflammation. We also employed moderation analysis models to assess dietary patterns’ role, finding that healthy diets may protect against heavy metal nephrotoxicity, while pro-inflammatory diets may exacerbate it. Consequently, reducing heavy metal exposure through environmental monitoring, targeting key inflammatory pathways in heavy metal nephrotoxicity, and promoting healthy diets constitute three vital evidence-based strategies for lowering the risk of kidney function impairment in exposed populations, holding great importance for public health improvement. However, this cross-sectional study has limitations. It cannot establish the temporal sequence of heavy metal exposure, inflammation, and chronic kidney disease, only allowing for the exploration of mediating effects between them; longitudinal studies are needed to clarify causality. Heavy metal exposure assessment relied on single blood/urine samples, which may not accurately reflect long-term exposure. Although acceptable due to heavy metals’ long half-lives, future research should use multiple samples or biomarkers for better long-term exposure assessment. The 24-h dietary recall method also has limitations, likely underestimating the associations between DII, HEI-2020, eGFR, UACR, and heavy metal exposure. Additionally, despite adjusting for key confounders using DAGs and multivariable models, unconsidered confounders might still influence results. Finally, the specific mechanisms of kidney function decline as a mediator remain unclear and require further laboratory investigation.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis study found that individual and combined exposures to blood heavy metals were significantly associated with decreased eGFR and increased UACR, while individual and combined exposures to urine heavy metals were mainly associated with decreased eGFR and UACR. Additionally, SIRI mediated the relationship between heavy metal exposure in blood or urine and kidney function impairment. Dietary patterns (DII and HEI2020) played a modulatory role, with increased DII exacerbating the negative effects of heavy metals on kidney function, while HEI2020 had a mitigating effect.\n\n## Supplementary Information\nBelow is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
