      "text": "With society placing a greater focus on\nthe long-term well-being\nof the environment and an increased onus on corporate social responsibility\nto achieve this, over the last two decades the pharmaceutical industry\nhas expended a significant effort on improving the sustainability\nof their chemical processes. Pivotal to\nthis initiative has been the formation of the American Chemical Society\nGreen Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS-GCIPR), and metrics from members of this group have led\nto an estimate that solvents utilized in such processes contribute\nto 80–90% in terms of the mass of waste streams and 75–80%\nof the overall life cycle impact of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. Despite this study being carried out 15 years\nago, marginal improvements in decreasing solvent use for small molecule\nAPI (active pharmaceutical ingredient) have been offset not only by\nthe increasing complexity of the molecules being synthesized but also\nby the growth of new therapeutic modalities such as peptides and oligonucleotides, which when performed using classical solid-phase methodologies are\nhighly solvent-intensive particularly through the multiple resin-washing\ncycles involved. While the value of employing a solvent and the roles\nthat this plays in mediating the transformations of organic compounds\ninto more complex molecules is well recognized, the extensive use\nof such materials has prompted scientists to study and seek to benchmark\nthe health, safety and environmental (HSE) scores for a diverse array\nof solvents leading to the development of various guides to enable\njudicious decisions to be made in terms of selection. Typically, these guides either prepared by individual companies\nor consortia such as the ACS-GCIPR are in good agreement as to which\nsolvents present greater hazards to the user as well as the deleterious\neffects that they pose to the environment. However, while the value\nof the metrics presented on the volumes of solvent utilized in the\nindustry is unquestionable, these have centered exclusively on amounts\nemployed in late development or manufacturing campaigns to produce\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and to the best of our knowledge, there are no systematic accounts\nthat accurately document solvent use in the early exploratory stages\nof the drug discovery process when chemical synthesis plays an extensive\nrole in the production of milligram amounts of potentially thousands\nof compounds for evaluation against a specific therapeutic target.\nOne rationale presented for this is that herein access to the required\ncompound is the primary goal, and while intensive synthetic efforts\nare dedicated to deliver the variety of analogs required for SAR (structure\nactivity relationship) studies, these often entail the use of suboptimal,\nlow-yielding fit-for-purpose synthesis routes on milligram scale.\nApplication of conventional metrics such as Process Mass Intensity\n(PMI) to these endeavors is both inconsistent and of questionable\noverall value with high values usually being obtained as result of\nthe low yields and chromatographic purification methods that are typically\nutilized. Taken out of context though,\nPMI metrics (or similar quantitative measures) on chemistry at the\nearly stage of drug development strongly imply that sustainability\nconsiderations do not play a role in the selection of the seemingly\nnonefficient synthetic routes applied, and that the opportunity to\ndevelop more green approaches to lead compounds only becomes a tangible\nconsideration as a molecule progresses toward further development\nas a potential clinical candidate. In\ndiscovery chemistry, the scale of operations is often cited to mitigate\nthese metrics though the waste streams generated and subsequent environmental\nimpact may not be as negligible compared to multikilogram development\nand manufacturing campaigns as one envisions particularly given the\nsheer number of ongoing medicinal chemistry projects and therefore\ncompounds being synthesized globally at any one time. In fact, while it is commonly believed that multistep synthesis\non milligram scales minimally impacts sustainability, it has been\nestimated that up to 3.5 million kilograms of waste are generated\nfrom drug discovery through preclinical studies. Furthermore, placing the sole reliance for the investigation/implementation\nof more sustainable approaches to candidate compounds on the Chemical\nDevelopment department creates significant resource pressures for\ngroups whose primary objectives are based on time-sensitive deliveries\nof high-quality materials intended for critical clinical studies. Despite the known hazards of many substances\nthat are utilized\ncommonly as solvents within Medicinal chemistry laboratories, the\nextensive role(s) and as such the inherent need for a solvent in a\nchemical reaction are well recognized. While solvent minimization is a viable strategy in attaining more\nfavorable Green Chemistry outcomes (prevention of waste), the choice\nof solvent is also critical with the use of benign solvents (principle\n5) and the desire to do less hazardous chemistry (numbers 3 and 12)\nhighlighted in the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry. In addition, considerations, such as choosing materials\nderived from renewable feedstocks and considering how easy they are\nto remove, are important factors. There are several solvent selection\ntools to aid in this endeavor, as discussed below. One factor that\nis important to bear in mind when making solvent selection for a specific\nreaction is the concept of solvent class, as often a more judicious\nchoice of the medium in which to carry out the reaction can be made\nthrough switching to a related member of the family without losing\nany of the benefits. An important concept with this strategy is that,\nwhereas naturally all chemicals/substances have some drawbacks from\nan environmental/sustainability perspective, seeking to minimize these\nis at the core of the decision made. The ACS-GCIPR Medicinal Chemistry subteam was created in 2012 with\none of its key initiatives being to both raise awareness and educate\npractitioners of the importance and positive downstream impact in\ndeveloping more sustainable synthetic routes in early discovery campaigns. Integral and perhaps most challenging to this\nobjective are to establish a mindset for a researcher to consider\nand implement green chemistry right from the outset and to unequivocally\ndemonstrate that many legacy notions that to achieve this in a fast-paced\ndrug discovery environment are incorrect. With these objectives in mind, herein we focus on the potential\nimpact of solvent usage in medicinal chemistry programs through an\nin-depth analysis of experimental data from the Journal of Medicinal\nChemistry given that this will serve as a representative reflection\nof the synthetic routes employed in an early drug discovery setting. To further cement the validity of this data\nset, a period of 20 years (2000–2020) was selected to provide\nan accurate illustration of the trends involved, most notably capturing\nthe promotion of new greener solvent alternatives as well as emerging\nchemical methodologies and associated solvent requirements disclosed\nduring an extended time phase. Not only are the solvents utilized\nin specific recurrent chemical transformations considered here but\nalso those that are employed in both workups and purifications. Furthermore,\nwe discuss the drivers and incentives for making judicious solvent\nselections at an early stage, most notably that such decisions can\naccelerate a program through development by avoiding further route\nchanges/optimizations necessitated through a requirement to switch\nthe reaction media. It is important to note that the study reported\nhere evaluates HSE score criteria based on NFPA (National Fire Protection\nAssociation) ratings using the ACS-GCIPR and CHEM21 solvent selection\nguides, though other such reports provide similar guidance about the\nselection of solvent replacements. This perspective also suggests\na series of preferred conditions from a sustainability perspective\nfor the top ten most common transformations reported in the medicinal\nchemistry literature, while strategies based on miniaturization explicitly\nusing High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) are discussed as a mechanism\nto both reduce solvent volumes and accelerate the identification of\nmore suitable solvents/conditions for a specific transformation. There are numerous sources of information\navailable that provide researchers with details regarding the safety\nand hazards inherent to a specific solvent/substance that is being\nused. Perhaps most valuable is the MSDS\n(Material Safety Data Sheet, sometimes referred to as an SDS that\ncontains the same information) that is supplied with all materials\nand can be easily accessed from a vendor’s Web site. The MSDS is defined as a document that provides\nworkers with procedures for safely handling or working with a particular\nsubstance (Figure \n). Many companies will also retain an internal repository/database\nof these as part of their Health and Safety groups. While variations\noccur in the appearance of the MSDS based on the source, these documents\nare typically templated and consist of 16 sections with sections 1\nand 2 dealing with the identification of the substance (and the supplier)\nand a high-level description of the hazards, respectively. Section\n3 describes the specification of the ingredients, while measures addressing\nFirst Aid, Firefighting, and Accidental Release are the topics for\nsections 4 through 6. Section 7 talks of the handling and storage\nof the material, while section 8 focuses on the exposure controls\nand necessary personal protection for working with the substance in\nquestion. Sections 9 and 10 report the physical/chemical properties\nand the stability/reactivity characteristics of the material in question,\nwhile sections 11 and 12 provide information on toxicological and\necological studies. Sections 13 and 14 provide guidance for the disposal\nand transportation of the chemical substance, with section 15 addressing\ninformation regarding regulatory listings. Section 16 is provided\nto disclose any relevant information that has not been captured elsewhere\nin the document. Representative MSDS with the section descriptors. Table \n summarizes\nsome of the properties of these solvents that we will provide an overview\nof in this section. Based on space constraints, this is obviously\nnot a complete list nor is the following discussion an exhaustive\noverview as detailed reports of numerous reports on physical properties,\nreactivity, and ecological and toxicological profiles of each solvent\nexist in the primary literature. The table includes thermal characteristics such as\nboiling point,\nflash point, and autoignition temperature. The latter two are often\nconfused, the flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature\nat which its vapors will ignite if given an ignition source, while\nthe autoignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a\nsubstance will spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere without\na source of ignition. The NFPA rating system (NFPA 704) provides a\nsimple visual representation mainly intended for emergency personnel\ndealing with a fire or spill to indicate the health (blue), flammability\n(red), reactivity (yellow) and special (white) hazards associated\nwith a specific material. Different colored\nsectors are employed to represent the distinct hazards with a number\nrating system of 0–4 (0 representing the least and 4 representing\nthe greatest risk) utilized to rate each of these on the diamond displayed\non the container of the substance. Figure \n provides an overview of the criteria applied\nto assign ratings to materials for each hazard. NFPA rating system. Other labeling systems (HMIS, OSHA HazCom) are\nalso often used\nthough they are not discussed here. The\nexplosive limits for a solvent specify the concentration range of\na material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an\nignition source and are usually expressed as the percent volume of\nthe material in the air. The Lower Explosive\nLimit (LEL) is the lowest concentration of vapor that will burn in\nair and for most flammable gases, it is less than 5% by volume, while\nthe Upper (or higher) Explosive Limit (UEL) is the highest concentration\nof a vapor above which a flame will not spread in the presence of\nan ignition source. It is important to note that percentages higher\nthan the UEL are considered to be “too rich to burn”. The LC50 and LD50 data tabulated provide\na relative assessment to the toxicity of a specific solvent and should\nbe considered in context. Specifically,\ntoxicity is divided into multiple categories based on the duration\nof exposure. Acute toxicity is typically\nassociated with a single exposure over a relatively short time, while\nchronic toxicity addresses repeated or long-term exposure that occurs\nover months to years. LD50 is used to describe acute toxicity and is the median lethal oral\n(or dermal) dose predicted to cause death in 50% of the test animals. The values are expressed in milligrams of compound\nper kilogram of body weight of the test species (mg/kg). While LD50 is the lethal dose, LC50 refers to the lethal\nconcentration and is utilized for inhalation-based studies (the values\nfor the latter can be reported in mg/L, mg/m3, or ppm). Comparisons are often challenging, as it is\nimportant to remember that estimates of the LD50 are specific\nto the test animals used in the study and variability is observed\nnot only between species but also between different studies. As a guideline, compounds with an oral LD50 of 0–50 mg/kg are considered highly toxic, while\nan LD50 of >2000 mg/kg is associated with a material\nof\nlow toxicity. Various assessments such as the Hodge/Sterner or Gosselin/Smith/Hodge\nscales can be used to compare and provide a more granular description\nof LD50 values, and extensive\ndatabases are available typically through subscription such as the\nRegistry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS). Even though the hazards presented by several\nsolvents are well\nunderstood, there are several that still find widespread use and for\nsome reactions/tasks represent the preferred choice in Medicinal Chemistry\nsynthesis programs despite their unsustainable nature (Figure \n). These solvents come from specific solvent classes, namely hydrocarbon, chlorinated, ethereal,\nand dipolar aprotic solvents with several\nrecent reviews providing a broad overview of their applications in\nsynthetic chemistry. A brief overview of each of the solvents is provided\nin the following sections with more detailed information around the\nhazards of these materials discussed in the Supporting Information. Nonsustainable solvents commonly used in medicinal chemistry. n-Hexane is a very volatile\naliphatic hydrocarbon that is insoluble in water and is commonly used\nas a solvent in medicinal chemistry laboratories most notably in chromatographic\nseparations. Caution must be exercised,\nas flammable vapors from this solvent may dissipate away from a spill\nand represent an explosion hazard. The odor threshold for hexane is\n130 ppm with the solvent reported to have a “faint, peculiar”\nodor. Various grades of hexane(s) are\navailable with the laboratory solvent n-hexane containing\napproximately 99% n-hexane, while “hexane”\nor “hexanes” is a commercial and industrial product\nconsisting of a mixture of n-hexane and its isomers\n2-methyl- and 3-methyl-pentane along with a small number of other\nhydrocarbons. 1,4-Dioxane is a colorless liquid that is commonly\nused as a solvent in medicinal chemistry laboratories most notably\nas a reaction solvent. It is completely\nmiscible with water and, in fact hygroscopic. The NFPA instability\nrating for this solvent is primarily based on its propensity for the\nformation of explosive peroxides, and robust, stringent testing criteria\n(date of opening, periodic testing, and prompt, appropriate disposal\nscheduled) should be established to ensure these do not become an\nissue. Crystals observed in the liquid\npotentially suggest that peroxidation has already occurred, and the\nproduct should be considered to be extremely dangerous. Then, and\nif peroxide formation is suspected, the container should not be opened\nor moved. With respect to flammable vapors,\nthese may dissipate away from a spill and may represent an explosion\nhazard. The odor threshold for 1,4-dioxane is 12 ppm with the solvent\nreported to have a “mild faint-sweet ether-like” odor.\n1,4-Dioxane is regulated by OSHA and is on the Special Health Hazard\nSubstance List because it is a carcinogen and is flammable. 1,2-Dimethoxyethane (DME) is a\ncolorless liquid with a sharp odor (no information available on the\nodor threshold) resembling petroleum distillates that finds used in\nresearch laboratories as a higher boiling alternative to both diethyl\nether and THF. It is often referred to\nby a variety of other names such as glyme, monoglyme, dimethyl glycol,\nethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and dimethyl cellosolve, and finds\nmore extensive use as the low-viscosity component of the solvent for\nelectrolytes of lithium batteries. It\nis completely miscible with water and has found applications as an\nalternative solvent for Grignard reactions as well as being used for\na functional solvent to provide homogeneous conditions for Pd-mediated\ncross-coupling reactions. Containers\nof DME may explode when heated, with vapors forming potentially explosive\nmixtures with air with the possibility of the vapors originating from\nthe source of ignition and causing flashback. As with many ether-based\nsolvents, explosive peroxide formation represents a significant concern,\nparticularly when the material is distilled, evaporated, or otherwise\nconcentrated. As noted previously, robust, stringent testing criteria\n(date of opening and periodic testing) should be established to ensure\nthat this does not become an issue. Diethyl ether is a colorless liquid that\nis for practical purposes immiscible with water (solubility 6.05 g/100\nmL at 25 °C), and possesses a pungent, sweetish, aromatic-like\nodor with a reported odor threshold of 0.83 ppm in air. While commonly used as a solvent in research\nlaboratories perhaps most notably as a solvent to facilitate crystallizations/extractions\nor solvent for organometallic reactions, diethyl ether is probably\nmore generally known as being extensively used as a general anesthetic. However, owing to its high flammability making\nthe solvent incompatible with modern surgical techniques as well as\nreports of abnormal liver function tests from patients anesthetized\nusing diethyl ether, its use in the medical setting is now obsolete. The flammability is widely cited as the major\nhazard associated with this solvent, and the compound is on the Special\nHealth Hazard Substance List due to this. Containers may explode when\nheated, with vapors forming potentially explosive mixtures with air\nwith the possibility of the vapors originating to the source of ignition\nand causing flashback. Again, the formation of explosive peroxides\nover time represents a significant concern, and containers should\nbe dated upon opening and tested periodically for the presence of\nperoxides. Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE or sometimes TBME) is on the Hazardous\nSubstance List as it is cited in by ACGIH, DOT, DEP, IARC, IRIS, and\nEPA, and it is also on the Special Health Hazard Substance List because\nof its flammability. It is reported to\nsmell like turpentine (like petroleum distillates) with other descriptors\nof its odor being “bitter”, “fruity”,\nor akin to a “cleaning-agent”. The odor threshold is\nreported to be between 0.09 and 0.13 ppm though such values tend to\nbe somewhat broad and as such smell alone should not be relied upon\nto determine potential exposure. MTBE\nis used as an octane booster in gasoline, as well as a solvent in chemical manufacture and in medicine to\nfacilitate the dissolution of gallstones. In research laboratories, MTBE is promoted as a safer alternative\nto diethyl ether and is used for many of the same purposes (such as\nreactions and to facilitate precipitations). Specific advantages to support this include a higher boiling point,\nreduced water solubility, and a lesser tendency for the formation\nof peroxides. It is flammable, and containers\nmay explode upon heating with the vapors having the potential to form\nexplosive mixtures with air. In addition, vapors may travel back to\na source of ignition, leading to flashback. Dichloromethane (methylene chloride,\nDCM) is on the Right to Know Hazardous Substance List owing to being\ncited by the full gamut of regulatory agencies (OSHA, EPA, ACGIH,\nDOT, NIOSH, NTP, NFPA, IARC, and DEP), as well as on the Special Health\nHazard Substance List. The compound is\na colorless, volatile liquid with a sweet smell with the odor threshold\ncited between 25 to 150 ppm (note: odor thresholds vary widely and\nshould not be relied on solely in determining potentially hazardous\nexposures). Regarding exposure, dichloromethane\nmay be a carcinogen in humans, and as such there is no considered\nsafe level of exposure and all contact should be reduced to the lowest\npossible level. Despite this, the solvent\nwas widely used in paint and varnish removal products and is still employed in research laboratories as a reaction\nmedium, extensively for liquid/liquid\nextractions (dichloromethane is immiscible with water) and for chromatographic\nseparations. Dichloromethane has no flash\npoint under conventional conditions though it is flammable (flash\npoint −7 °C) when exposed to O2 gas. Dichloromethane can also form flammable vapor-air\nmixtures above 100 °C and has an autoignition temperature of\n556 °C. Although dichloromethane may burn, it does not readily\nignite though poisonous gases including hydrogen chloride and phosgene\nare produced in a fire. Similarly, to dichloromethane, chloroform\nis listed on both the Right to Know Hazardous Substance List and the\nSpecial Health Hazard Substance List. Chloroform is a colorless liquid\nreported to have a pleasant, sweet smell, with an odor threshold between\n2.4 and 85 ppm, though as noted odor thresholds vary greatly and odor\nshould not be solely relied upon to determine potentially hazardous\nexposures. Chloroform is a probable carcinogen\nin humans, and as such, there are no safe levels of exposure, and\nall contact should be reduced to the minimum possible level. Chloroform is used as a solvent and in the manufacture\nof refrigerants, resins, and plastics. As a laboratory solvent specifically both in liquid/liquid extractions\nand chromatography with dichloromethane (see above) is suggested as\na suitable replacement for chloroform though the higher boiling point\nof the latter still leads to its use in some thermally mediated reactions,\nwhile the deuterated version is widely used as an NMR solvent. Historically, chloroform was widely employed\nas an anesthetic since the 1850s, though this practice stopped after\nca. 100 years owing to both the complications encountered in controlled\nadministration of an effective dose as well as the development of\nsafer alternatives. Chloroform has a\nboiling point of 61 °C, with no flash point (caution should be\nexercised herein as chloroform often contains ethanol, which is volatile\nand flammable, as a stabilizer) or autoignition temperature. No explosive\nlimits are reported for chloroform though explosions of sealed containers\nhave occurred through reactions with acetone and/or strong bases. In a fire, it should also be noted that chloroform\ncan lead to the production of poisonous gases. While 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) may\nbe a carcinogen and, as such, is listed on the Right to Know Hazardous\nSubstance as well as the Special Health Hazard Substance Lists, unlike\nDCM and chloroform, DCE is also a flammable solvent. DCE is a colorless\nliquid reported to have a pleasant smell with an odor threshold of\nbetween 88 and 400 ppm, though due to variances herein, this should\nnot alone be used to determine hazardous exposures. As a possible carcinogen, there are no safe levels of exposure\nand therefore all contact should be reduced to as low a level as possible. In addition to its use as a laboratory solvent,\nDCE is widely used to make vinyl chloride and is a key step in the manufacture of PVC and was historically\nused as an antiknock additive in gasoline. DCE has a boiling point of 83 °C thus representing a higher\nboiling option to both the previously discussed chlorinated solvents,\nand forms azeotropes with many other solvents including water (at\na boiling point of 71 °C) despite being immiscible with the latter. The utility of DCE though as a solvent can to\nsome degree be limited by its potential reactivity with functional\ngroups such as amines. Containers of\nDCE even when empty should be kept away from heat and sources of ignition,\nand vapors can form explosive mixtures in air and travel back to a\nsource of ignition and flashback. Thermal decomposition can lead to\nthe release of toxic and irritating gases and vapors including CO,\nCO2, hydrogen chloride, and phosgene. DMF is included on the candidate list for REACH (Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation)\nwithin the EU (ECHA – European Chemical Agency) as a substance\nof very high concern (SVHC) owing primarily to acute toxicity and\nits reported propensity to lead to adverse reproductive and developmental\neffects. In addition, it is on the Right\nto Know Hazardous Substance List, owing to citations from a broad\nrange of regulatory organizations. DMF is a colorless (though sometimes\nslightly yellow) liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water.\nIt is reported to have a fishy, unpleasant (ammonia-like) odor with\nan odor threshold of 2.2 ppm (estimates of this have varied between\n0.47 and 100 ppm again demonstrating how odor thresholds can vary\ngreatly and given this odor alone should not be taken to determine\npotential exposure). DMF is widely used\nas an industrial solvent to produce polymer fibers, films, and surface\ncoatings. In the pharmaceutical industry,\npolar aprotic solvents such as DMF are broadly used for specific subsets\nof reactions (SNAr, amide bond formation, solid-phase peptide\nsynthesis) exploiting its relatively high boiling point, and its ability\nto solubilize a wide range of drug-like molecules as well as in crystallization\nprocesses in which the miscibility with water (as an effective antisolvent)\nis taken advantage of. DMF has a boiling\npoint of 153 °C, though it is purified through distillation under\nreduced pressure to avoid potential decomposition. Although this is not reported to occur until much higher\ntemperatures, disproportionation leading to CO and dimethyl amine can be observed in some reaction media, while\nthere have been instances of DMF vapors traveling back to an ignition\nsource leading to a flashback. DMF has been extensively used\nas a solvent for synthetic reactions utilizing the widely employed\nstrong base sodium hydride. This is mainly due to the solvent’s\nability to solubilize both organic and inorganic compounds. However,\ndespite the prevalence of this practice, the hazards associated with\nthe thermal instability of NaH/DMF mixtures particularly on scale-up\nare significantly underappreciated and seldom discussed within the\nchemistry community. Thermal decomposition\nof a NaH/DMF mixture was first observed in the 1960s with further\nincidents reported since in the literature, while calorimetric studies\ndemonstrated that these mixtures can self-heat at temperatures often\nin an unpredictable manner though at temperatures as low as 26 °C.\nA more detailed report of the explosive hazard of NaH in DMF was published\nin 2019, and while this combination is rarely seen now in scale-up\nsynthetic routes, it is still utilized in medicinal chemistry laboratories,\nand this is a practice that should be highly discouraged. In a similar manner, studies have also demonstrated\nthat solutions of NBS in DMF undergo a hazardous thermal decomposition\nat low temperature with a safe working temperature for a 22 wt % solution\nestablished to be 32 °C. Probing\nthis phenomenon highlighted a possible autocatalytic mechanism for\ndecomposition with further investigations carried out to establish\nthe role of concentration/materials, etc., on both the onset temperature\nand the overall energy output. Like DMF, DMA is included on the candidate list for REACH within\nthe EU as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) owing primarily\nto acute toxicity and its reported propensity to lead to damage the\nliver. In addition, it is on the Hazardous\nSubstance List owing to citations from a range of regulatory organizations.\nDMA is a colorless liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water.\nIt is reported to have a faint ammonia-like odor with an odor threshold\nof 47 ppm though the range of accepted odor thresholds can be quite\nbroad thus highlighting that caution should be exercised in relying\non odor alone as a warning for potentially hazardous exposures. In addition to being employed in medicinal chemistry\nlaboratories, DMA is used as a solvent for plastics, resins, and gums. In research, its employment as a solvent is\noften to exploit its polarity, relatively high boiling point, and\nability to effectively solubilize a broad range of both organic and\ninorganic compounds. This miscibility with water also presents an\nopportunity in the crystallization space in which the aqueous component\nacts as an “anti-solvent”. DMA has a boiling point of 165 °C being again distilled under\nvacuum to avoid thermal disproportionation, which leads to dimethylamine\nbeing produced. DMA has a flashpoint\nof 63 °C and an autoignition temperature of 490 °C with\nthe potential for containers to explode when heated (note that both\nproduct and empty containers should be kept away from heat and sources\nof ignition). In a similar manner to DMF, DMA has also been\nwidely employed as a solvent for reactions involving the strong base\nNaH. Process safety studies have confirmed that this results in a\nmixture that possesses a propensity for self-heating with the formation\nof noncondensable gasesous products during thermal decomposition,\nthus presenting a viable scenario for a runaway reaction. GC studies\nherein showed that the release of H2 occurred at a lower\ntemperature than with the NaH/DMF sample with methane, ethane, acetylene,\nand CO also been observed as being formed. Avoiding using NaH/DMA\neven in discovery-scale reactions is strongly recommended. NMP (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone)\nis reported on the REACH authorization list as an SVHC owing to its\ntoxicity profile specifically that the compound may be a teratogen\nin humans leading to malformation of embryos. In addition, it causes severe irritation to the skin and eyes and\nmay irritate the lungs. NMP is also listed on both the Right to Know\nHazardous Substance List (cited by DOT, DEP, NFPA, and EPA) and the\nSpecial Health Hazard Substance List. NMP is a colorless, hygroscopic\nliquid noted to have a “mild-amine”, fishy-like smell\nwith an odor threshold reported to be between 4 and 10 ppm though\nodor should not solely be used as an indicator to determine potential\nexposure. NMP is a combustible liquid\nand should be kept away from heat, sparks, and sources of ignition.\nNMP is widely used as a solvent in a variety of industries including\npaints/coatings removal, petrochemical processing, agricultural chemicals,\nelectronics cleaning, and industrial/domestic cleaning. The high boiling point of this solvent is exploited\nin synthetic chemistry, for example, in Cu-based Ullmann couplings, and again the miscibility with water can be\ntaken advantage of in developing suitable crystallizations for emerging\ndrug development candidates. With the hazards\nof several solvents established, it is important to consider what\nrole solvents play in a reaction, and what resources are available\nto inform the decisions made in selecting them. Specifically, the use of a solvent is key to enable mixing and mass transport between phases and can have an influence on both the rate and selectivity\n,\n of a particular\nprocess.\n,\n Perhaps the most important use\nof solvents is from a safety perspective, wherein the reaction medium\ntypically acts as a “heat sink” to control exotherms\narising from the reaction. Solvents also are widely utilized in techniques\ninvolved in product isolation and though we will not consider this\nhere, in cleaning protocols. While many\nare beyond the scope of this perspective, it is important to note\nthat several suggested “greener alternatives” have been\ninvestigated that avoid the use of a conventional reaction solvent\nincluding running reactions neat, solid-phase\nreactions as well as employing surfactants\nto enable chemistry in aqueous media or exploring emerging options for conducting reactions such as ionic\nliquids or supercritical fluids. It cannot be overemphasized how important the\nselection of a solvent is not only in dissolving and dispersing the reaction\nparticipants but also in being of the appropriate polarity to promote the chemistry (SN2, E1CB, etc.) and through modification of the solute properties\n(redox potential, pKa, H-bonding). Add to this the benefits gained through removing impurities/byproducts\nthrough partitioning, and isolation\nof the desired product by crystallization demonstrates how selection of the right solvent from the outset\ncan alleviate issues with downstream processing. The contribution of the solvent toward the Process Mass\nIntensity (PMI) of a process only exacerbates this decision and most\nnotably how the potential hazards arising from this should be minimized. The ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS-GCIPR)\nwas established in 2005 when the ACS Green Chemistry Institute and\na handful of pharmaceutical companies saw an opportunity to work together\nin a precompetitive manner to promote green chemistry and engineering\ninnovation. One of the major initiatives of the ACS-GCIPR is the development\nof a robust suite of tools that embrace\ncommonly agreed-upon metrics and support chemists’ choices\naround material and method selection to maximize resource efficiency,\nminimize hazards, and reduce waste and cost over the life cycle of\nthe process. While initially developed\nby and for the pharmaceutical industry, it should be emphasized that\nthese tools are also useful and accessible to the broader chemistry\nand chemical engineering communities. Two such resources have been developed with respect to solvent selection,\nnamely a solvent guide and a solvent\nselection tool. While the former provides\ntabulated information ranking solvents through evaluation of various\nproperties, the latter allows a more prospective approach to solvent\nselection/optimization through identification of suitable reaction\nmedia utilizing the desired properties to facilitate the process as\ninputs. While the properties of a solvent are key to making\nan informed\ndecision, there are other factors that need to be considered. Obviously,\nthe chemistry must work, and it is important that the solvent is also\ninert under the reaction conditions, while enabling the workup/isolation\nof the desired product can also streamline the process. Solvent recovery\nand potential for recycling should be considered, while safety and\npotential hazards to both health and the environment are critical.\nOverall cost not only to purchase the material but also to dispose\nof the waste stream in compliance with the relevant legislation must\nbe kept in mind. The term “green solvent” is widely\nemployed in the chemistry literature, and it is important to establish\ncriteria for a material to meet with this definition. Specifically, a material should be derived\nfrom a renewable feedstock and place low demands on the energy required\nto produce it. The solvent should also be biodegradable, insoluble\nin water, and have a midrange boiling point in that it is not too\nlow as to be considered a VOC and not too high in that it is difficult\nto recycle. Married to these characteristics should be the properties\nof materials that are considered to be “safe” solvents\nwith high stability, low flammability (high FP) and low to moderate\ntoxicity. Often during discussions regarding the development/utilization\nof solvents, the environmental impacts associated with the overall\nmanufacture of the materials are overlooked though they are a vital\npart of the complete picture. While a detailed discussion of this\nis beyond the scope of this perspective, it is, however, critical\nfor the scientist to have knowledge of the factors involved to allow\nfor both the judicious selection of current reaction solvents to be\nmade as well as a critical benchmarking of the processes reported\nto produce emerging “greener” reaction solvents. In\naddition, when considering aspects of worker safety, it is important\nalso to consider workers associated with the various manufacturing\nprocesses in addition to the end user. In many cases, the manufacturing\nprocesses for a solvent are energy-intensive and generate significant\ngreenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to climate change, with\nthis issue being exacerbated by the requisite transportation of solvents\nto various locations for use. As noted, many solvents are volatile\norganic compounds (VOCs) that vaporize quickly at room temperature\nand, during manufacture, can escape into the atmosphere. Reactions\noccur with other chemicals contributing to ground-level ozone, which\nis a component of smog. Not only does this contribute to air pollution\nbut also leads to impacts on health, such as causing respiratory issues\nand triggering asthma. Many manufacturing processes for solvents also\ngenerate wastewater that can often contain chemical pollutants, with\nstringent control measures required to prevent these entering waterways\nto contaminate aquatic ecosystems. With newer reaction media, much\nonus is placed on these being derived from renewable feedstocks as\nmost of the current solvents we utilize are derived from oil and gas,\nwhich are finite resources, though the overall proposed manufacture\nof a new solvent (or a conventional solvent from renewable feedstocks)\nhas to be considered as more hazardous processes may be involved if\na biobased feedstock is employed as the raw material. In addition, for a complete lifecycle analysis\nof a solvent to be derived, the extraction/processing of the raw materials\nalso needs to be considered. While developing\nnewer reaction media represents an aspirational long-term goal, one\nkey factor which should be implemented where viable to mitigate the\nenvironmental impact of a solvent is solvent recovery/recycling systems\nthat reduce waste and can save costs/resources through enabling reuse\nof a solvent. However, in discovery,\nimplementing such systems is often not viable owing to the scales\ninvolved, while in pharmaceutical industry development/manufacturing,\nthere are regulatory guidelines to comply with. As noted, there are numerous\nsolvent guides readily available, though they all represent variations\non a theme most notably in how the relevant information is presented.\nBehind each of these guides, though, three common themes emerge: worker\nsafety, process safety, and environmental and regulatory considerations.\nThese are then broken down into various subcategories, which can be\n“scored” for each of the solvents under consideration\nbased on the available data, with the range of scores across categories\nthen weighted according to the specific guide to provide an overall\ndesirability for each specific solvent (and class). Typically, the\nguides are presented in a manner that allows granular decisions to\nbe made based not only on the overall rankings of solvents but also\non differentiation in the three areas defined above. Within these,\nfor worker safety, carcinogenicity,\nmutagenicity, reprotoxicity, skin absorption/sensitization, and toxicity\nare typically considered, while for process safety, flammability,\npotential for high emissions (high vapor pressure), peroxide formation, static charge, and odor issues are considered.\nFinally, ecotoxicity, potential groundwater contamination, EHS regulatory restrictions, ozone depletion, photoreactivity, and compliance with all relevant\nlegislation are all part of an evaluation of environmental and regulatory\nconsiderations. A survey of the\nsolvent selection guides published shows there to be approximately\n67% agreement in terms of the classifications of the materials evaluated.\nWhile there is excellent agreement in terms of most solvents that\nare either recommended or highly hazardous, there are discrepancies\ndistinguishing between recommended/problematic or problematic/hazardous\nclassifications based on a different weighting of the criteria used\nin the assembly of discrete guides. The IMI-Chem21 project funded\nthrough the EFPIA (European Foundation of Pharmaceutical Industries\nand Associations) and the European Union comprised of a number of\ncompanies (including several pharmaceutical companies) and universities\nwith the overall remit to develop sustainable biological and chemical\nmethodologies both through supporting research as well as providing\ntraining packages. One of the components\nof the latter was the development of a common solvent selection guide\nto allow a preliminary assessment of a solvent’s desirability\nto be used for scale-up purposes in the fine chemical industry. This\nguide not only includes classical solvents, but also is extended to\nnewer solvents as well as highlighting bioderived solvents. Although the guide was assembled as part of\na collaborative effort, like in all such endeavors, there are potential\ngaps in the methodology used with suggestions that the health criteria\nshould be based on OEL (Occupational Exposure Limit) while the environmental scoring should include the CO2 synthesis impact/GWP (Global Warming Potential). However, it is stressed that the tool is intended\nfor a preliminary assessment, with further discussion encouraged in\nspecific cases to challenge the ranking. For the Chem21 solvent\nguide, the scoring (score in each category\nbetween 1 and 10) and ranking are determined as follows. The physical\ndata and GHS (globalized harmonized system) hazard statements are collected from the SDS, and the safety\nscore is calculated using the flash point, autoignition temperature,\nresistivity, ability to form peroxides, etc. This proves the easiest\nto establish as while the health score reflecting the occupational\nhazard would most ideally be linked to the OELs, these are only established\nfor the most common solvents, and in addition, these threshold limits\nare not unified. The health score is therefore linked to the most\nstringent H3xx statement, thus capturing the potential severity of\nthe hazard as well as the range of impact. To these scores, a modifier\nof “plus 1” is added if the boiling point is less than\n86 °C. For solvents with incomplete toxicological data, a default\nscore of 5 is assigned. The environmental scoring is still not complete\nbased on lack of data for some materials though it is based on boiling\npoint as well as the nature of the H4xx statement. For each solvent,\nthree scores (HS&E) are determined with the ranking determined\nby a combination of these. Solvents with one score >8 or two scores\n>7 are classified as “hazardous” (red), one score\n=\n7 or two scores between 4 and 6 are assigned “problematic”\n(yellow), while all other solvents are “recommended”\n(green). The version of the guide showing 53 common solvents\nis shown in Figure \n. As the ranking\nsystem does not distinguish between “hazardous” and\n“highly hazardous” solvents, several have been defined\nas the latter based on group discussion. With the methodology, 36\nsolvents present a clear ranking with an 81% concordance with that\nobtained from the survey of the other published solvent selection\nguides, though it should be noted that in some cases this tool underestimates\nboth the health and safety hazards presented by a specific solvent.\nIn the cases in which a clear ranking was not determined, the default\nappears to be close to that previously reported. Chem21 solvent selection\nguide. Reproduced from ref.  with permission from the\nRoyal Society of Chemistry. This methodology was also applied to a series of\nemerging solvents\nthat have been purported as “greener” replacements for\nclassical solvents. The data are presented in Figure \n, and while highlighting the value of some\nof these alternative reaction media, it also serves to focus on areas\nin which more information is needed regarding both their ecotoxicity\nand general toxicity profiles. For some as well, it is also key to\nensuring reaction compatibility prior to utilization. Chem21 solvent selection\nguide: Emerging “greener”\nsolvents. Reproduced from ref.  with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. “What would\nserve as a suitable replacement solvent” is a typical question\nthat arises during the optimization of a chemical reaction, and usually,\nthe obvious answer to this is to consider homologues of what the currently\nemployed solvent is. For example, we replaced methanol with ethanol.\nHowever, this analysis can be somewhat flawed as it offers the question\nas to not only whether ethanol is the best alternative but also whether\nmethanol was actually the best starting point. An alternative way\nto consider this is to find a way to define whether solvents are “similar”\nor “different” in behavior beyond simple chemical functionality\nand to search for the ideal solvent based on the needs of the reaction.\nWhile the solvent selection guides, we have considered aid in identifying\nsolvents, they are typically utilized for postselection comparison\nbetween the solvent options. While this is valuable, it should be\nconsidered that often making an objective decision can be compromised\nby several factors, notably, what solvents are readily in hand, what\ndid the chemist use last time for such a transformation, or the commercial\navailability of the solvent. With these factors in mind, the choice\nof solvent is restricted to a simple consideration of the chemistry\n(polarity, incompatible functionality, and temperature range). The ACS-GCIPR solvent selection tool reverses this philosophy and\nfocuses on the molecular properties as opposed to the solvents themselves\nand looks to see the properties that will either interfere with or\nfacilitate the proposed process with the ideal selection envisioned\nto work across the reaction, workup, and isolation steps. The tool\nfeatures 272 solvents including research, process, and next-generation\ngreen solvents with ∼100 options included for the user to filter/highlight\nto help identify the best for their given reaction. Included herein\nare a range of 30 physicochemical properties for each solvent including\nrudimentary experimental data like boiling/melting points, viscosity,\nor other safety markers like flash/ignition points, which can be combined\nwith properties that capture aspects of the solvent’s polarity,\npolarizability, and hydrogen-bonding ability, such as dielectric constants,\ndipole moments, or Hansen parameters to name a few. The filter tab\nalso allows the user to select or discard different functional groups\nin order to restrict the output to a given class of solvents. Other\ncategories that can be evaluated are impacts on health, environmental\neffects on air and water, life-cycle assessment, and ICH solvent information\n(Figure \n). What the\ntool intends to do is to enable the user to define the requirements\nof their application with a set of 272 solvents and then be dynamically\ninterrogated to provide a shortlist of hits meeting these parameters. ACS-GCIPR\nsolvent selection tool. The objectivity highlighted through the solvent\nselection tool\nrepresents the key differentiator in that during this phase of the\nworkflow leading to the identification of the shortlist, the specific\nidentities of the solvents are never explicitly revealed. This serves\nto not only remove any inherent biases but also facilitate the opportunity\nto identify less obvious solvents that may be potentially advantageous\nfor a specific application. At this juncture, it is instructive\nto learn how the tool works\nand to validate its performance given the body of knowledge that the\nscientific community has accumulated over time regarding classical\nsolvents. The first challenge is to break down each solvent into a\nseries of descriptors with many of these being identified, such as\nchemical functionality, molecular descriptors, physical properties,\nregulatory classification, legal controls, environmental impact, and\nhealth and safety performance with numerous subcategories present\nin many of these. In evaluating a solvent for a specific purpose,\nsome or all of these descriptors could be important in making the\nright decision, while it can be challenging making comparisons while\nbalancing the impact of a wide range of parameters. To achieve this\nand enable identifying “similar” and “different”\noptions, it is necessary to represent solvents at a level beyond the\nindividual molecular properties. For this purpose, using a multivariate\ntechnique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows many potentially\ncorrelated parameters to be reduced to a small number of descriptors. For the solvent data, PCA identified 5 principal\ncomponents, enabling a model to be generated to distribute the solvents\nin 5-dimensional space (PC1 through PC5). There have been various\nreports on utilizing PCA for the analysis of solvents though a facile\nmethod to understand this is that when considering how a solvent may\ninteract with a solute, there are several potential mechanisms that\nmay be at play, which may all depend to varying degrees of different\nproperties of the solvent molecule under consideration. Given this, PCA is an established method to\n“combine” and “weight” a series of experimental/computed\nproperties of a solvent into discrete parameters (PC1, PC2, etc.)\nto enable benchmarking/comparison studies of solvents to be carried\nout effectively using the selection tool. The default view in\nthe tool is the projection in the plane of\nthe most dominant descriptors (PC1, PC2), and initial validation of\nthe tool can be derived when one visualizes solvents with the same\nprimary functionality (homologues within the same series) across these\ntwo vectors with the outcome that they occur in very close proximity\nto each other on the plot. From a high-level perspective, PC1 is the\ndominant descriptor representing a global lipophilicity (hydrophobicity)-polarity\nscale, while PC2 captures the next most significant characteristics\nand provides a representation of the hydrogen-bonding ability of a\nsolvent. Subsequent PCs (PC3–PC5) account for progressively\nsmaller amounts of the total variance, signifying finer distinctions\nin a solvent’s properties (volume, 3D shape, surface area,\netc.). Within the analysis, it is important to bear in mind that a\nspecific property/molecular descriptor can be embedded into multiple\nPCs though with a variation in terms of its weighting/contribution\nto that global property. In addition to validation of the generated\nPCA map through observed clustering of a related chemical series of\nesters, correlation with observed chemical phenomena (keto-enol tautomerism, O- vs C-alkylation, rates of SNAr reactions, etc.) provides further authentication of the value\nof this approach. While it is intuitive to infer that those solvents\nin proximity on the map are similar, this may not be the case in all\ndimensions, demonstrating that solvents that at first inspection appear\nvery different (for example, in terms of functionality) may offer\nmore similarities than simple chemical functionality may suggest,\nthus highlighting the value of this approach (Figure \n). While the background to how the data are\ncompiled and validated is useful to know, many users can exploit the\ntool simply to provide a graphical view of the solvent shortlist. ACS-GCIPR\nsolvent selection tool: Comparing solvents through PCA\nanalysis. Figure \n illustrates\ntwo high-level scenarios in which the value of utilization of the\nsolvent selection tool might be realized. The first is a screening\nscenario in which a new reaction is being considered, and it is not\nclear what is required in terms of solvent properties for the application\n(Figure \na). The remit\nbeing screening already implies that there is only limited information\navailable to start a search, and as such the exercise is truly holistic.\nHerein identifying an initial hit is useful, and then applying appropriate\nfilters will provide a shortlist of possible alternatives to evaluate.\nGiven the nature of the exercise, avoiding aggressive application\nof the filters is beneficial. Furthermore, when the desired view has\nbeen generated, a selection of representative solvent candidates from\ndiscrete quadrants will provide a first-pass evaluation as to the\ndesirable property space for the solvent for the transformation under\ninvestigation. Utilization of the ACS-GCIPR solvent selection tool: (a)\nScreening\nfor new potential reaction solvents; (b) Solvent optimization/replacement. A second scenario is perhaps more clear-cut being\nan optimization\nin which an initial hit is known (perhaps identified through screening),\nthough replacement options are desired (Figure \nb). In this case, it is reasonable to expect\nthat proximal solvents to the initial hit on the PCA map will provide\nsome degree of “similar” behavior. With this, applying\nfilters to a localized subset should provide a reasonable starting\npoint, while expanding/reducing the scope of these criteria is possible\ndepending on the scope/goals of the optimization study. In this scenario,\nthe tool serves as an “idea generator” and evaluating\nacross the various components while filtering using the properties\noptions allows a user to generate a “shortlist” that\ncan then be experimentally evaluated through a further screening campaign.\nThe ease of use and speed of the tool allow this to be achieved in\na relatively expeditious manner. Often,\nthe selection of a solvent for a specific transformation is based\non legacy experience, and given this and the established nature of\norganic synthesis, we hypothesized that certain synthetic transformations\nare more likely to rely on hazardous or problematic solvents than\nothers. Given this, we sought to gain a more thorough understanding\non which reaction classes have placed a strong reliance on what we\nwould consider to be poor solvent selections. To achieve this, we\nrevisited the solvent usage habits across the Medicinal Chemistry\ncommunity by surveying what reaction media were used for the most\nrecurrent synthetic transformation classes as previously identified\nfrom the experimentals of J. Med. Chem. by Brown\nand Bostrom in 2016.\n,\n In addition to these fundamental\nreactions, the central role that heterocyclic systems play in medicinal\nchemistry is also taken into account with the analysis extended to\nevaluate “heterocyclic synthesis”, which provides data\non the solvents utilized for reactions employed in the formation of\n3, 4, 5, and 6-membered heteroatom-containing rings (N, O, and S). We conducted our SciFinder-n survey on these\ntransformations across a broader time frame (2000–2021) though\nonce again limiting the scope of our investigation to articles from J. Med. Chem. Each synthetic transformation was defined\nby a structural search with remarkably ∼70% of the total reactions\nundertaken coming from just six of the 20 classes (excluding “heterocycle\nsynthesis” from this analysis as this covers a broader range\nof reaction types) that were evaluated (Figure \n). Common transformations in medicinal chemistry\n(J. Med.\nChem. 2000–2021). A visual depiction of the solvent usage data is\ndisplayed in Figure \n in which the number\nof incidences of the use of undesirable solvents is expressed as a\npercentage of the total number of occurrences for each specific reaction\nclass. It can be noted in the analyses presented that in addition\nto granular metrics regarding the use of the unsustainable solvents\nhighlighted in this review, data on a subset of other “hazardous”\nsolvents are presented. Although this category features a range of\nsolvents that are employed on a more sporadic basis, it demonstrates\nthat benzene, pyridine, carbon tetrachloride (and other chlorinated solvents), di-iso-propyl ether\n,\n and HMPA have all been used as reaction media within\nmedicinal chemistry programs, and as with the featured unsustainable\nsolvents, replacing these materials in reactions of interest is strongly\nrecommended. Percentage uses of the solvents/reaction class. Overall, evaluating the data, it can clearly be\nseen that across\nall reaction classes the use of the problematic solvents DMF and DCM\nis prevalent, though despite this and the lesser use of solvents such\nas Et2O, DME, dioxane, DCE, and NMP, the latter group still\nsees significant use and throughout these applications, the potential\nreplacement with greener alternatives would be beneficial. In addition,\nthe data demonstrate that often a specific solvent is selected for\na discrete reaction class, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that solvent\nselection is often based on legacy experience. Examples of this observation\ninclude 1,4-dioxane for Suzuki–Miyaura (∼26%), Buchwald–Hartwig couplings (∼28%), and Boc protection/deprotections (∼11/13%); DME for Suzuki–Miyaura couplings (∼14%) and notably diethyl ether for the addition\nof organometallic reagents to electrophiles (∼17%) (e.g., Grignard\nreactions). Notably for these applications\ninvolving ethereal solvents, medicinal chemists are encouraged to\ntest more environmentally benign derivatives like 2-MeTHF and CPME (vide infra), which have been reported to perform in a comparative\nmanner to those historically used for these applications. Further analysis of these data showed\nthat among the 20 reaction\nclasses, two (amide formation and oxidation of alcohols) used unsustainable\nsolvents in ∼70% of the reported instances, while a further\ngroup of 9 transformations was performed in hazardous reaction solvents\nwith between 50% and 70% probability (Figure \n). In contrast, only 7 of the reaction classes\nwere performed in undesirable solvents less than 40% of the number\nof times that they were reported. Almost half of the ∼35k amine\nalkylations were reported in undesirable solvents with 33% using DMF.\nSimilarly, ester formation (∼15k hits) was also carried out\n∼50% of the time using undesirable solvents (DCM 31%, DMF 13%),\nwhich is somewhat surprising given that these could be avoided if\nenvironmentally benign reaction media such as alcoholic systems are\nused with an acid catalyst. The exponential growth of Pd-mediated\ncouplings over the past 20 years is highlighted by ∼29k examples\nof Suzuki–Miyaura couplings being reported in the journal with\nover half of these using hazardous solvents most notably those that\nare potential carcinogens (1,4-dioxane 26%; DME 14%).\n, Overall utilization of nonsustainable/hazardous solvents. While these data are interesting, it is perhaps\nmore instructive\nto focus on what solvent choices are made for the most popular reactions\ncurrently carried out within medicinal chemistry programs. The most\npopular is amide bond formation, which is reported on >63k occasions\nutilizing DCM or DMF in 28% or 36% respectively of those instances.\n,\n In contrast, the formation of heterocycles represents the second\nmost prevalent transformation (∼56k) using hazardous solvents\n∼32% of the time with either DCM or DMF being employed equally\nin almost two-thirds of these occurrences. Strategies commonly invoked\nfor SAR investigations involve employing reactions to efficiently\nforge carbon-heteroatom bonds around the periphery of a core bioactive\nscaffold. Several transformations allow for the robust formation of\nC–N bonds with broad substrate scope enabling their application\nin parallel library format to access collections of related molecules\nto expedite SAR studies. Specifically, from our data, C­(sp2)–N/O bond formation (most notably Buchwald-Hartwig couplings),\nnitrogen alkylation, and reductive amination are exemplified on ∼64k occasions with\n47% of these being carried out in solvents, which are “undesirable”.\nFor each of these transformations, one can easily identify research\nopportunities to develop replacements for dioxane (28%, C­(sp2-N/O bond formation), DMF (33%, nitrogen alkylation) and chlorinated\nmedia (29%, reductive amination) for these reactions. There are ∼39k reports of Boc deprotections,\nand the data from these highlight one of the challenges often faced\nwithin a Discovery Chemistry environment. Herein for convenience,\na commercial solution of HCl in 1,4-dioxane (4 M) is extensively utilized\nas the reagent, thus leading to ∼13% of the reactions being\ncarried out using this solvent (this is like the statement above regarding\nthe use of diethyl ether for Grignard reactions given that many of\nthese reagents are supplied commercially as solutions in this solvent). DCM is also extensively used for Boc deprotections\n(∼33% of the time, typically with TFA) while DMF is also often encountered (∼12%) in this\ntransformation. It is worth noting that all three of these solvents\n(DCM, dioxane, and DMF) are also regularly used in reactions to install\nthe Boc-protecting group. One further observation from the data is\nthat there is a significant disparity in the reaction data between\nthe number of instances in which a Boc-protecting group is installed\nas opposed to its removal, with the latter dominating by almost 10-fold.\nAt first glance, this would appear to be counterintuitive as one would\nexpect these reactions to be somewhat equivalent. However, discovery\nchemistry programs rely to a large degree on the commercial availability\nof orthogonally protected building blocks and monomers to elaborate\ncompounds to investigate chemical space. Given this within our programs,\nthe Boc-protected amine is often employed as a starting material,\nand thus, only the removal is carried out within our laboratories. From our survey, the six transformations described thus far account\nfor almost 70% of the reactions described with the remaining 14 reaction\nclasses accounting for the remainder. However, distinct trends emerge in the analysis of this subset of\ndata. Notably, the reduction of aromatic nitro groups to anilines\nappears to exhibit the most benign solvent profile with this typically\ncarried out in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, EtOAc, and THF\nin contrast to examples in more problematic reaction media (13%). Perhaps this is not surprising given that this\ntransformation is often carried out via hydrogenation with a heterogeneous\ncatalyst and the typical solvents used\npresent favorable properties in terms of both solubilizing the gas\nand facilitating the mass transfer between the three phases. While selecting a potential solvent for this\nreaction, one can prioritize using either an alcohol or EtOAc for\nthis transformation, specifically when the significant energy considerations\nassociated with the manufacture of THF are considered. This though\nis very much the exception with, for example, DMF being frequently\nused across phenol alkylation (35%), ester formation (13%), O-debenzylation\n(6%) and C­(sp2)–N/C­(sp2)–O bond\nformations (7%). As noted, the latter also frequently uses dioxane\n(28%), while another ethereal solvent DME is employed in ∼14%\nof Suzuki–Miyaura couplings. The analysis of this subset of\nreaction classes also highlights DCM as a “go-to” solvent\nfor numerous transformations including alcohol oxidations (54%, often\nin tandem with the Dess–Martin periodinane of related hypervalent-iodine-based\nreagents), sulfonamide synthesis (40%),\nester formation (31%) O- (20%), and N-debenzylations (15%). A rationale\npresented for the prevalent use of solvents such as DMF and DCM in\nmedicinal chemistry is often their ability to solubilize a broad range\nof organic molecules, though AI/ML-based\npredictive methods for compound solubility are emerging, which may\nprovide an opportunity to select more sustainable reaction media based\nspecifically on the substrate of interest. With these data in hand, one can immediately reach the conclusion\nthat significant impacts in terms of sustainability can be gained\nwithin a medicinal chemistry program simply by developing “greener”\nconditions specifically with the use of more environmentally benign\nsolvents for the transformation. To achieve this, the data were further\nrefined to highlight not only the most recurrent reaction classes\nbut also those that typically employ undesirable solvents. This led\nus to identify the following 12 transformations, which would benefit\nfrom greener reaction conditions with the numbers in parentheses representing\nan approximate “count” of the occasions that this reaction\nhas been performed in a hazardous solvent in the period under review.\nThese are amide formation (45k), Boc deprotection (26k), amine alkylation\n(18k), synthesis of heterocycles (18k), Suzuki–Miyaura coupling\n(16k), ester hydrolysis (9k), reductive amination (8k), sulfonamide\nsynthesis (8k), ester hydrolysis (8k), phenol alkylation (7k), C­(sp2)–N/C­(sp2)–O bond formations (4k),\nand oxidation of alcohols (4k). However, despite what might appear\nto be a somewhat bleak outlook, from our extensive literature review,\nfor all of these transformations noted here, there exist numerous\nexamples in which the reactions are conducted under more sustainable\nconditions. In the next section, a series of these have been collated\nfor each transformation in a readily accessible format, thus enabling\nthese to be investigated as potential “first-pass” conditions\nupon encountering a new substrate without the need for extensive literature\nresearch. There are several approaches that can be adopted to pursue greener\nconditions for a specific transformation under investigation. As highlighted,\nthe choice of solvent plays a major role in assessing the overall\nsustainability of the reaction not only through the relative volume\nof possible waste generated but also through its potentially undesirable\nproperties (toxicity, etc.). Considering this, the strategy of straight\nsubstitution of the solvent for a more sustainable medium presents\na logical path forward, and this can be greatly facilitated using\na solvent guide as previously discussed. This has successfully been\nimplemented and reported on several occasions for example, the replacement\nof DCM with 2-MeTHF for amide bond formations, switching DMF for more\nrecently developed polar aprotic solvents like cyrene or dimethyl isosorbide in SNAr reactions,\nand replacing ether with 2-MeTHF for Grignard chemistry. An extension\nof this approach is offered through the solvent selection tool, which\nenables the user to utilize the most desirable properties that the\nreaction medium should possess to mediate the transformation of interest\n(polarity, pKa etc.) and then apply these to identify\nsolvents that may be of value. With a specific transformation\nin mind, the ACS-GCIPR Reagents Guide presents an excellent resource\nin providing a starting point for conditions to explore for a given\nreaction. Currently this tool covers 29 transformations demonstrating\nfor each the possible reagents to be utilized in a simple Venn diagram\nformat, in which conditions are assigned based on criteria around\n“wide substrate scope”, “applicability to scale”,\nand “greenness”. Naturally those results found at the\nintersection of the three circles represent a “sweet spot”\nin terms of overall applicability and sustainability (Figure \n). However, within medicinal\nchemistry programs, the objective is often speed, and as such, conditions\nthat have been shown previously to have worked for a wide variety\nof examples are the most compelling, though these are often found\nto not be particularly attractive from a green perspective. Annotated\nACS-GCIPR reagent guide Venn diagram (alcohol oxidation). The strategies so far discussed focus on either\nthe choice of solvent\nor reagent selection for a specific transformation, which overlooks\nthe fact that these two discrete parameters are often critically interrelated.\nOn most occasions when a medicinal chemist is confronted with a new\nchemical series to work on, they will search a database (either a\ncommercial offering such as SciFinder or an institutional ELN: Electronic\nLab Notebook) for reactions that have been run on similar substrates\nto provide initial conditions to test. With this workflow, it is highly\nlikely to perpetuate chemically successful, albeit nonenvironmentally\nsustainable reaction conditions given that the methods previously\nutilized were largely developed in a time when the importance of sustainability\nwas not as widely recognized. Based on our extensive data mining\ndescribed for obtaining the\nsolvent usage information, herein we propose an alternative strategy\nfor the choice of initial reaction conditions to evaluate when faced\nwith a novel chemical series. Collected in Table \n, one will find a selection of at least three\ncurrent, more environmentally sustainable conditions for each of the\nten most common reaction types observed in JMC as previously discussed.\nThe proposed conditions are ordered from “more conservative”\nat the top to “further from precedent” at the bottom,\nand we suggest that these can be utilized in situations when a medicinal\nchemist is confronted with either a new substrate/chemical series\nor perhaps even better when trying to “green” a current\nreaction. Each reaction shows a specific substrate with the reaction\nconditions and the corresponding references, thus eliminating the\nneed for the chemist to look up alternate sources, and it is envisioned\nthat Table \n will serve\nas a valuable resource for “green” conditions for the\nabove (12) most common reaction types. To assist in both its uptake\nand overall utility, a poster version of this information has been\nmade available in the Supporting Information for use as a Quick Reference Guide. The overall approach suggested\nherein is unique in not only in marrying the reagents/solvents for\na specific transformation but also for the fact that in many cases\nthe selected examples have been performed on pharmaceutically relevant\nsubstrates, thus somewhat mitigating common concerns regarding substrate\nsolubility under a specific set of reaction conditions, which is often\na major challenge when a simple “solvent swap” is implemented\nto “green” a reaction.\n,,,− It\nhas been widely recognized throughout the industry that the major\ncontributors to the PMI of a chemical reaction are solvents and water,\nand while this is well established particularly in chemical development,\nmedicinal chemists often use large volumes of water and organic solvents\nparticularly in the extractive workup of chemical transformations. In fact, the elimination of such workups and\ntheir replacement with solvent swaps through distillation to telescope reaction steps represents a common strategy to drive down PMI numbers\nwithin chemical development. In order\nto assay the impact of solvent usage for workup and purification (vide infra) within the medicinal chemistry research phase,\na similar survey to that described previously was conducted of published J. Med. Chem. procedures between 2000 and 2021. To streamline\nthe analysis, a representative sampling of four publications was chosen\nfrom each year for a total of 80 publications over the 20-year span\nleading to 1874 experiments being reviewed. Of these experiments,\nit was shown that 53% utilized an extractive aqueous workup procedure\n(Figure \n).\n,\n In the remaining cases, an extractive workup is avoided either through\ndirect precipitation of solutes through addition of an antisolvent\nor through a simple evaporation to yield the crude product. In contrast to the range of solvents used for\nreactions, the options for extraction are more limited based on the\nrequirement for them to be essentially immiscible with water, and\nthose utilized in the reactions surveyed are collected in Figure \n. Pleasingly from\na sustainability perspective, over half of the analyzed reactions\nused EtOAc (54%) as the solvent for extraction. However, 31% of the reactions utilized hazardous chlorinated\nsolvents, while 7% used extremely flammable diethyl ether, which is\nalso prone to peroxide formation. The survey also clearly reveals\nthat there has been little to no uptake in medicinal chemistry settings\nof newly emerging solvents such as MTBE, CPME, and 2-MeTHF for extractions. While these solvents can serve as greener and\nsafer alternatives to diethyl ether (the flashpoint of diethyl ether\nis −40 °C, while that of 2-MeTHF is −12 °C),\n2-MeTHF also presents an alternative to dichloromethane, which as\nnoted has both health and environmental concerns. From a practical\nperspective, 2-MeTHF (unlike THF) is immiscible with water and can\nthus be used to extract products directly from reaction mixtures without\nthe formation of emulsions, which is often a challenge with dichloromethane.\nOne of the drivers often presented for the use of chlorinated solvents\nfor extraction within medicinal chemistry is that the desired products\nare often highly polar and water-soluble, and as such diethyl ether\nand EtOAc are ineffective as extraction solvents. Recent work by Reetz and coworkers has identified n-butanol as an ecologically\nviable choice for such systems with this solvent proving to be particularly\neffective for the extraction of polar compounds from enzymatic processes. Furthermore, simply through reducing both the\nnumber of extractions employed during an aqueous workup and the volume\nof solvents utilized during the process can greatly reduce the overall\nPMI value of the transformation leading to a more sustainable outcome. Analysis of (a) methods of purification and\n(b) extractive workups\nin medicinal chemistry procedures. Solvents used in extractive workups (right schematic combines\nnonsustainable\nsolvents: see Table \n). In addition to workup conditions, the experimental\nprocedures were\nalso probed to assay the trends in the purification methods of choice\nwithin a medicinal chemistry setting. Of the 1874 reactions surveyed,\nca. 90% utilized a purification method of some kind (Figure \n), while the survey indicated\nthat in contrast to chemical development, telescoping reactions are\nnot regularly exploited in research settings with only 187 instances\nof this being encountered. It is self-evident that telescoping of\nreactions can lead to a reduction in solvent usage (reaction, workup,\nand purification) as well as potentially time and energy savings.\nIn contrast to development chemistry, telescoping represented only\n∼10% of this data set though this is probably not too surprising\nbased on the primary focus of the articles being the syntheses of\nmultiple discrete compounds for biological assays. The predominant\nmethod of purification (>50% of cases) was normal-phase chromatography\nusing a solid support, which in most cases is silica.\n,\n This group has previously published on concepts around “sustainability\nchromatography” providing not only a roadmap of potential alternatives\nto avoid chromatography but also suggested “greener”\nreplacements to commonly used mobile phases. The popularity of this method of purification has no doubt been\nmaintained through the ease of accessibility of simple to use, automated\nsystems that are prevalent throughout medicinal chemistry laboratories. The survey indicated that the predominant nonpolar\neluant in normal-phase chromatography was hexane, though from a Green\nChemistry perspective, this solvent should be replaced with cyclohexane\nor more preferably heptane (Figure \na). These latter solvents are significantly less toxic\nand thus have higher occupational exposure limits than hexane. The\nlower volatility of heptane compared to both hexane and pentane also\nleads to lower emissions and decreased environmental impact while\nalso representing less of a fire hazard. From a practical standpoint,\nthe higher boiling point of heptane often allows compounds to be precipitated\ndirectly upon evaporation of heptane/EtOAc mixtures. The survey also\nindicates that dichloromethane, most commonly in combination with\nmethanol, remains a common solvent utilized in medicinal chemistry\nsettings for chromatography. This is even though practical, straightforward,\nand more environmentally responsible alternatives to this toxic solvent\nhave been evaluated and proven to be effective. In particular, the\nsurvey indicated little uptake of a 3:1 mixture of EtOAc/ethanol (polar\neluent) and heptane (nonpolar eluent) as a recommended substitution\nfor dichloromethane even though the EtOAc/EtOH blend is now commercially\navailable and a much greener solvent alternative to dichloromethane/methanol\nmixtures. HPLC was also found to be\na common technique for product purification in medicinal chemistry\nlaboratories though evaporation/lyophilization of aqueous mixtures\ncan be relatively energy intensive.\n,\n SFC is often\npromoted as a “greener” method for product purification\n,\n though the survey revealed that this is rarely utilized probably\nowing to the nature of this technique (requiring high-pressure CO2 supply) thus restricting it to specialist purification laboratories.\n,\n The ACS-GCIPR have recently developed an Analytical Method Greenness\nScore (AMGS) tool, which can be utilized to benchmark and compare\ndirectly analytical methods. The AMGS\nmetric factors in both the impact of the solvent (health, safety,\nenvironmental, and waste), the energy demands of the instrumentation\nas well as the overall technique and highlights the sustainability\nbenefits that can be gained in selecting more modernized methods and\ntechniques without compromising separation performance.\n, Analysis of solvents used in (a) chromatography and (b) alternative\nworkups/purification methods. Impact of miniaturization on the reaction number/scale/solvent\nuse. Adapted from ref.  with permission from Elsevier. Within medicinal chemistry, access to milligram quantities of bioactive\ncompounds often suffices for initial profiling in relation to target\nbiology and metabolic stability, and as such the scale on which one\noperates becomes a critical consideration in minimizing waste. A successful discovery campaign will iteratively\nimprove on advanced compounds through a well-established “design,\nmake, test, analyze” cycle with\nspeed of execution being a critical factor leading to a heavy reliance\non parallel synthesis and reversed-phase/accelerated\napproaches to purification to drive\ndecision making. This oft-unstated emphasis on proceeding in an expeditious\nfashion can lead to a prioritization of compound numbers (diversity)\nat the expense of poor synthetic chemistry and thus sustainability. Miniaturization provides a complementary\nstrategy to solvent replacement in minimizing/reducing the pharmaceutical\nindustry’s footprint on global sustainability. Miniaturization and High Throughput Experimentation\n(HTE) are inseparable technologies, which have advanced in their ability\nto solve chemistry problems over the past 20 years. In one manifestation, HTE involves performing multiple\nchemical reactions in parallel, whether for the purpose of parallel\nevaluation of multiple conditions (one reaction, many sets of conditions)\nor for parallel synthesis (multiple reacting partners typically under\na common set of conditions). In comparison to reactions conducted\neither in dram vials or round-bottom flasks, decreasing the vessel\nsize to 8 × 30 mm (100 μL) or even 4 × 21 mm (25 μL)\nutilizes significantly reduced solvent volumes (Figure \n). Alternatively, reactions\ncan also be conducted in a 96-well (or 384/1536) plate format though solvent compatibility with plastics\n(e.g., polystyrene) needs to be taken into consideration. With advances in technologies such as analytical\ntechniques, tumble-stirring, inertion chambers, aluminum heating blocks, LED plates, biocatalysis, innovative approaches\nto reagent dosing, and parallel electrochemical\ndesigns, the majority of synthetic organic\nreactions can now be performed on a microscale (which we will define\nas ≤1 mg of substrate per reaction). Hypothetically, an array of 40 microscale reactions consumes the\nsame quantity of substrate (and solvent) as a single reaction at a\n1 mL scale (Figure \n). Potential impact of investment in HTE\non parallel medicinal chemistry. Uptake of both miniaturization and HTE can have\nprofound impacts\non sustainability and Green Chemistry goals, as demonstrated specifically\nthrough the following activities. Rapid Optimization Increases the Probability\nof Success for Parallel Synthesis\n – consider running an array of compounds under suboptimal\nconditions in which only 20% of reactions lead to the desired product.\nFor example, if there are 24 reactions (1 mL solvent each), with a\n20% success rate, only 5 analogs will be successfully obtained. Furthermore,\none strategy that is often adopted for poor-performing reactions is\nto increase the scale to ensure that “some” product\nis obtained leading to additional solvent use as well as potentially\nlaborious purification sequences. If, for example, a quick optimization\nis carried out using preplated catalysts, and the success rate were to be enhanced to 80%, 19 analogs will\nbe registered. To illustrate this as an estimate, Scenario A translates\nto 100 mL of solvent and uses 3.24 g of advanced intermediate (or\ntemplate), whereas Scenario B requires only ∼25 mL of solvent\nwhile now using 984 mg of compound. Further benefits are also realized\nwith reduced cycle time as well as reductions\nin waste generated owing to less starting template being used (e.g.,\ndiscarded nitrile gloves, test tubes, syringes, purification solvents,\nreaction workup waste) (Figure \n).\nLess is More.\nPushing the Boundary to Nanoscale\nSynthesis – there has long been a disconnect within\nmedicinal chemistry between the amount of compound synthesized compared\nto the amount of material needed for an initial biochemical assay,\nthough with additional recent advances, conducting reactions on vanishingly\nsmall quantities (0.05 mg) has become possible. To this end utilizing automated liquid-handling techniques\ncapable of dispensing droplet quantities, chemists are now able to\nconduct analog syntheses in a 1536-well-plate format either with or\nwithout purification allowing a rapid and systematic evaluation of\nchemical space while minimizing solvent use (conducting 1536 reactions\neach in 1.2 μL of solvent uses less than 2 mL in total). This\nrepresents a seismic shift in the volumes of solvents utilized during\nan SAR campaign if the chemistries for each discrete analog are performed\non a nanoscale.

      "title": "Solvent Hazards",
      "text": "There are numerous sources of information\navailable that provide researchers with details regarding the safety\nand hazards inherent to a specific solvent/substance that is being\nused. Perhaps most valuable is the MSDS\n(Material Safety Data Sheet, sometimes referred to as an SDS that\ncontains the same information) that is supplied with all materials\nand can be easily accessed from a vendor’s Web site. The MSDS is defined as a document that provides\nworkers with procedures for safely handling or working with a particular\nsubstance (Figure \n). Many companies will also retain an internal repository/database\nof these as part of their Health and Safety groups. While variations\noccur in the appearance of the MSDS based on the source, these documents\nare typically templated and consist of 16 sections with sections 1\nand 2 dealing with the identification of the substance (and the supplier)\nand a high-level description of the hazards, respectively. Section\n3 describes the specification of the ingredients, while measures addressing\nFirst Aid, Firefighting, and Accidental Release are the topics for\nsections 4 through 6. Section 7 talks of the handling and storage\nof the material, while section 8 focuses on the exposure controls\nand necessary personal protection for working with the substance in\nquestion. Sections 9 and 10 report the physical/chemical properties\nand the stability/reactivity characteristics of the material in question,\nwhile sections 11 and 12 provide information on toxicological and\necological studies. Sections 13 and 14 provide guidance for the disposal\nand transportation of the chemical substance, with section 15 addressing\ninformation regarding regulatory listings. Section 16 is provided\nto disclose any relevant information that has not been captured elsewhere\nin the document. Representative MSDS with the section descriptors. Table \n summarizes\nsome of the properties of these solvents that we will provide an overview\nof in this section. Based on space constraints, this is obviously\nnot a complete list nor is the following discussion an exhaustive\noverview as detailed reports of numerous reports on physical properties,\nreactivity, and ecological and toxicological profiles of each solvent\nexist in the primary literature. The table includes thermal characteristics such as\nboiling point,\nflash point, and autoignition temperature. The latter two are often\nconfused, the flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature\nat which its vapors will ignite if given an ignition source, while\nthe autoignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a\nsubstance will spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere without\na source of ignition. The NFPA rating system (NFPA 704) provides a\nsimple visual representation mainly intended for emergency personnel\ndealing with a fire or spill to indicate the health (blue), flammability\n(red), reactivity (yellow) and special (white) hazards associated\nwith a specific material. Different colored\nsectors are employed to represent the distinct hazards with a number\nrating system of 0–4 (0 representing the least and 4 representing\nthe greatest risk) utilized to rate each of these on the diamond displayed\non the container of the substance. Figure \n provides an overview of the criteria applied\nto assign ratings to materials for each hazard. NFPA rating system. Other labeling systems (HMIS, OSHA HazCom) are\nalso often used\nthough they are not discussed here. The\nexplosive limits for a solvent specify the concentration range of\na material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an\nignition source and are usually expressed as the percent volume of\nthe material in the air. The Lower Explosive\nLimit (LEL) is the lowest concentration of vapor that will burn in\nair and for most flammable gases, it is less than 5% by volume, while\nthe Upper (or higher) Explosive Limit (UEL) is the highest concentration\nof a vapor above which a flame will not spread in the presence of\nan ignition source. It is important to note that percentages higher\nthan the UEL are considered to be “too rich to burn”. The LC50 and LD50 data tabulated provide\na relative assessment to the toxicity of a specific solvent and should\nbe considered in context. Specifically,\ntoxicity is divided into multiple categories based on the duration\nof exposure. Acute toxicity is typically\nassociated with a single exposure over a relatively short time, while\nchronic toxicity addresses repeated or long-term exposure that occurs\nover months to years. LD50 is used to describe acute toxicity and is the median lethal oral\n(or dermal) dose predicted to cause death in 50% of the test animals. The values are expressed in milligrams of compound\nper kilogram of body weight of the test species (mg/kg). While LD50 is the lethal dose, LC50 refers to the lethal\nconcentration and is utilized for inhalation-based studies (the values\nfor the latter can be reported in mg/L, mg/m3, or ppm). Comparisons are often challenging, as it is\nimportant to remember that estimates of the LD50 are specific\nto the test animals used in the study and variability is observed\nnot only between species but also between different studies. As a guideline, compounds with an oral LD50 of 0–50 mg/kg are considered highly toxic, while\nan LD50 of >2000 mg/kg is associated with a material\nof\nlow toxicity. Various assessments such as the Hodge/Sterner or Gosselin/Smith/Hodge\nscales can be used to compare and provide a more granular description\nof LD50 values, and extensive\ndatabases are available typically through subscription such as the\nRegistry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS). Even though the hazards presented by several\nsolvents are well\nunderstood, there are several that still find widespread use and for\nsome reactions/tasks represent the preferred choice in Medicinal Chemistry\nsynthesis programs despite their unsustainable nature (Figure \n). These solvents come from specific solvent classes, namely hydrocarbon, chlorinated, ethereal,\nand dipolar aprotic solvents with several\nrecent reviews providing a broad overview of their applications in\nsynthetic chemistry.

      "title": "Resources to Inform Solvent Selection",
      "text": "With the hazards\nof several solvents established, it is important to consider what\nrole solvents play in a reaction, and what resources are available\nto inform the decisions made in selecting them. Specifically, the use of a solvent is key to enable mixing and mass transport between phases and can have an influence on both the rate and selectivity\n,\n of a particular\nprocess.\n,\n Perhaps the most important use\nof solvents is from a safety perspective, wherein the reaction medium\ntypically acts as a “heat sink” to control exotherms\narising from the reaction. Solvents also are widely utilized in techniques\ninvolved in product isolation and though we will not consider this\nhere, in cleaning protocols. While many\nare beyond the scope of this perspective, it is important to note\nthat several suggested “greener alternatives” have been\ninvestigated that avoid the use of a conventional reaction solvent\nincluding running reactions neat, solid-phase\nreactions as well as employing surfactants\nto enable chemistry in aqueous media or exploring emerging options for conducting reactions such as ionic\nliquids or supercritical fluids. It cannot be overemphasized how important the\nselection of a solvent is not only in dissolving and dispersing the reaction\nparticipants but also in being of the appropriate polarity to promote the chemistry (SN2, E1CB, etc.) and through modification of the solute properties\n(redox potential, pKa, H-bonding). Add to this the benefits gained through removing impurities/byproducts\nthrough partitioning, and isolation\nof the desired product by crystallization demonstrates how selection of the right solvent from the outset\ncan alleviate issues with downstream processing. The contribution of the solvent toward the Process Mass\nIntensity (PMI) of a process only exacerbates this decision and most\nnotably how the potential hazards arising from this should be minimized. The ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS-GCIPR)\nwas established in 2005 when the ACS Green Chemistry Institute and\na handful of pharmaceutical companies saw an opportunity to work together\nin a precompetitive manner to promote green chemistry and engineering\ninnovation. One of the major initiatives of the ACS-GCIPR is the development\nof a robust suite of tools that embrace\ncommonly agreed-upon metrics and support chemists’ choices\naround material and method selection to maximize resource efficiency,\nminimize hazards, and reduce waste and cost over the life cycle of\nthe process. While initially developed\nby and for the pharmaceutical industry, it should be emphasized that\nthese tools are also useful and accessible to the broader chemistry\nand chemical engineering communities. Two such resources have been developed with respect to solvent selection,\nnamely a solvent guide and a solvent\nselection tool. While the former provides\ntabulated information ranking solvents through evaluation of various\nproperties, the latter allows a more prospective approach to solvent\nselection/optimization through identification of suitable reaction\nmedia utilizing the desired properties to facilitate the process as\ninputs. While the properties of a solvent are key to making\nan informed\ndecision, there are other factors that need to be considered. Obviously,\nthe chemistry must work, and it is important that the solvent is also\ninert under the reaction conditions, while enabling the workup/isolation\nof the desired product can also streamline the process. Solvent recovery\nand potential for recycling should be considered, while safety and\npotential hazards to both health and the environment are critical.\nOverall cost not only to purchase the material but also to dispose\nof the waste stream in compliance with the relevant legislation must\nbe kept in mind. The term “green solvent” is widely\nemployed in the chemistry literature, and it is important to establish\ncriteria for a material to meet with this definition. Specifically, a material should be derived\nfrom a renewable feedstock and place low demands on the energy required\nto produce it. The solvent should also be biodegradable, insoluble\nin water, and have a midrange boiling point in that it is not too\nlow as to be considered a VOC and not too high in that it is difficult\nto recycle. Married to these characteristics should be the properties\nof materials that are considered to be “safe” solvents\nwith high stability, low flammability (high FP) and low to moderate\ntoxicity. Often during discussions regarding the development/utilization\nof solvents, the environmental impacts associated with the overall\nmanufacture of the materials are overlooked though they are a vital\npart of the complete picture. While a detailed discussion of this\nis beyond the scope of this perspective, it is, however, critical\nfor the scientist to have knowledge of the factors involved to allow\nfor both the judicious selection of current reaction solvents to be\nmade as well as a critical benchmarking of the processes reported\nto produce emerging “greener” reaction solvents. In\naddition, when considering aspects of worker safety, it is important\nalso to consider workers associated with the various manufacturing\nprocesses in addition to the end user. In many cases, the manufacturing\nprocesses for a solvent are energy-intensive and generate significant\ngreenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to climate change, with\nthis issue being exacerbated by the requisite transportation of solvents\nto various locations for use. As noted, many solvents are volatile\norganic compounds (VOCs) that vaporize quickly at room temperature\nand, during manufacture, can escape into the atmosphere. Reactions\noccur with other chemicals contributing to ground-level ozone, which\nis a component of smog. Not only does this contribute to air pollution\nbut also leads to impacts on health, such as causing respiratory issues\nand triggering asthma. Many manufacturing processes for solvents also\ngenerate wastewater that can often contain chemical pollutants, with\nstringent control measures required to prevent these entering waterways\nto contaminate aquatic ecosystems. With newer reaction media, much\nonus is placed on these being derived from renewable feedstocks as\nmost of the current solvents we utilize are derived from oil and gas,\nwhich are finite resources, though the overall proposed manufacture\nof a new solvent (or a conventional solvent from renewable feedstocks)\nhas to be considered as more hazardous processes may be involved if\na biobased feedstock is employed as the raw material. In addition, for a complete lifecycle analysis\nof a solvent to be derived, the extraction/processing of the raw materials\nalso needs to be considered. While developing\nnewer reaction media represents an aspirational long-term goal, one\nkey factor which should be implemented where viable to mitigate the\nenvironmental impact of a solvent is solvent recovery/recycling systems\nthat reduce waste and can save costs/resources through enabling reuse\nof a solvent. However, in discovery,\nimplementing such systems is often not viable owing to the scales\ninvolved, while in pharmaceutical industry development/manufacturing,\nthere are regulatory guidelines to comply with."

      "title": "Solvent Guides/Tables",
      "text": "As noted, there are numerous\nsolvent guides readily available, though they all represent variations\non a theme most notably in how the relevant information is presented.\nBehind each of these guides, though, three common themes emerge: worker\nsafety, process safety, and environmental and regulatory considerations.\nThese are then broken down into various subcategories, which can be\n“scored” for each of the solvents under consideration\nbased on the available data, with the range of scores across categories\nthen weighted according to the specific guide to provide an overall\ndesirability for each specific solvent (and class). Typically, the\nguides are presented in a manner that allows granular decisions to\nbe made based not only on the overall rankings of solvents but also\non differentiation in the three areas defined above. Within these,\nfor worker safety, carcinogenicity,\nmutagenicity, reprotoxicity, skin absorption/sensitization, and toxicity\nare typically considered, while for process safety, flammability,\npotential for high emissions (high vapor pressure), peroxide formation, static charge, and odor issues are considered.\nFinally, ecotoxicity, potential groundwater contamination, EHS regulatory restrictions, ozone depletion, photoreactivity, and compliance with all relevant\nlegislation are all part of an evaluation of environmental and regulatory\nconsiderations. A survey of the\nsolvent selection guides published shows there to be approximately\n67% agreement in terms of the classifications of the materials evaluated.\nWhile there is excellent agreement in terms of most solvents that\nare either recommended or highly hazardous, there are discrepancies\ndistinguishing between recommended/problematic or problematic/hazardous\nclassifications based on a different weighting of the criteria used\nin the assembly of discrete guides. The IMI-Chem21 project funded\nthrough the EFPIA (European Foundation of Pharmaceutical Industries\nand Associations) and the European Union comprised of a number of\ncompanies (including several pharmaceutical companies) and universities\nwith the overall remit to develop sustainable biological and chemical\nmethodologies both through supporting research as well as providing\ntraining packages. One of the components\nof the latter was the development of a common solvent selection guide\nto allow a preliminary assessment of a solvent’s desirability\nto be used for scale-up purposes in the fine chemical industry. This\nguide not only includes classical solvents, but also is extended to\nnewer solvents as well as highlighting bioderived solvents. Although the guide was assembled as part of\na collaborative effort, like in all such endeavors, there are potential\ngaps in the methodology used with suggestions that the health criteria\nshould be based on OEL (Occupational Exposure Limit) while the environmental scoring should include the CO2 synthesis impact/GWP (Global Warming Potential). However, it is stressed that the tool is intended\nfor a preliminary assessment, with further discussion encouraged in\nspecific cases to challenge the ranking. For the Chem21 solvent\nguide, the scoring (score in each category\nbetween 1 and 10) and ranking are determined as follows. The physical\ndata and GHS (globalized harmonized system) hazard statements are collected from the SDS, and the safety\nscore is calculated using the flash point, autoignition temperature,\nresistivity, ability to form peroxides, etc. This proves the easiest\nto establish as while the health score reflecting the occupational\nhazard would most ideally be linked to the OELs, these are only established\nfor the most common solvents, and in addition, these threshold limits\nare not unified. The health score is therefore linked to the most\nstringent H3xx statement, thus capturing the potential severity of\nthe hazard as well as the range of impact. To these scores, a modifier\nof “plus 1” is added if the boiling point is less than\n86 °C. For solvents with incomplete toxicological data, a default\nscore of 5 is assigned. The environmental scoring is still not complete\nbased on lack of data for some materials though it is based on boiling\npoint as well as the nature of the H4xx statement. For each solvent,\nthree scores (HS&E) are determined with the ranking determined\nby a combination of these. Solvents with one score >8 or two scores\n>7 are classified as “hazardous” (red), one score\n=\n7 or two scores between 4 and 6 are assigned “problematic”\n(yellow), while all other solvents are “recommended”\n(green). The version of the guide showing 53 common solvents\nis shown in Figure \n. As the ranking\nsystem does not distinguish between “hazardous” and\n“highly hazardous” solvents, several have been defined\nas the latter based on group discussion. With the methodology, 36\nsolvents present a clear ranking with an 81% concordance with that\nobtained from the survey of the other published solvent selection\nguides, though it should be noted that in some cases this tool underestimates\nboth the health and safety hazards presented by a specific solvent.\nIn the cases in which a clear ranking was not determined, the default\nappears to be close to that previously reported.

This methodology was also applied to a series of\nemerging solvents\nthat have been purported as “greener” replacements for\nclassical solvents. The data are presented in Figure \n, and while highlighting the value of some\nof these alternative reaction media, it also serves to focus on areas\nin which more information is needed regarding both their ecotoxicity\nand general toxicity profiles.

      "title": "ACS-GCIPR Solvent Selection Tool",
      "text": "“What would\nserve as a suitable replacement solvent” is a typical question\nthat arises during the optimization of a chemical reaction, and usually,\nthe obvious answer to this is to consider homologues of what the currently\nemployed solvent is. For example, we replaced methanol with ethanol.\nHowever, this analysis can be somewhat flawed as it offers the question\nas to not only whether ethanol is the best alternative but also whether\nmethanol was actually the best starting point. An alternative way\nto consider this is to find a way to define whether solvents are “similar”\nor “different” in behavior beyond simple chemical functionality\nand to search for the ideal solvent based on the needs of the reaction.\nWhile the solvent selection guides, we have considered aid in identifying\nsolvents, they are typically utilized for postselection comparison\nbetween the solvent options. While this is valuable, it should be\nconsidered that often making an objective decision can be compromised\nby several factors, notably, what solvents are readily in hand, what\ndid the chemist use last time for such a transformation, or the commercial\navailability of the solvent. With these factors in mind, the choice\nof solvent is restricted to a simple consideration of the chemistry\n(polarity, incompatible functionality, and temperature range). The ACS-GCIPR solvent selection tool reverses this philosophy and\nfocuses on the molecular properties as opposed to the solvents themselves\nand looks to see the properties that will either interfere with or\nfacilitate the proposed process with the ideal selection envisioned\nto work across the reaction, workup, and isolation steps. The tool\nfeatures 272 solvents including research, process, and next-generation\ngreen solvents with ∼100 options included for the user to filter/highlight\nto help identify the best for their given reaction. Included herein\nare a range of 30 physicochemical properties for each solvent including\nrudimentary experimental data like boiling/melting points, viscosity,\nor other safety markers like flash/ignition points, which can be combined\nwith properties that capture aspects of the solvent’s polarity,\npolarizability, and hydrogen-bonding ability, such as dielectric constants,\ndipole moments, or Hansen parameters to name a few. The filter tab\nalso allows the user to select or discard different functional groups\nin order to restrict the output to a given class of solvents. Other\ncategories that can be evaluated are impacts on health, environmental\neffects on air and water, life-cycle assessment, and ICH solvent information\n(Figure \n). What the\ntool intends to do is to enable the user to define the requirements\nof their application with a set of 272 solvents and then be dynamically\ninterrogated to provide a shortlist of hits meeting these parameters. ACS-GCIPR\nsolvent selection tool. The objectivity highlighted through the solvent\nselection tool\nrepresents the key differentiator in that during this phase of the\nworkflow leading to the identification of the shortlist, the specific\nidentities of the solvents are never explicitly revealed. This serves\nto not only remove any inherent biases but also facilitate the opportunity\nto identify less obvious solvents that may be potentially advantageous\nfor a specific application. At this juncture, it is instructive\nto learn how the tool works\nand to validate its performance given the body of knowledge that the\nscientific community has accumulated over time regarding classical\nsolvents. The first challenge is to break down each solvent into a\nseries of descriptors with many of these being identified, such as\nchemical functionality, molecular descriptors, physical properties,\nregulatory classification, legal controls, environmental impact, and\nhealth and safety performance with numerous subcategories present\nin many of these. In evaluating a solvent for a specific purpose,\nsome or all of these descriptors could be important in making the\nright decision, while it can be challenging making comparisons while\nbalancing the impact of a wide range of parameters. To achieve this\nand enable identifying “similar” and “different”\noptions, it is necessary to represent solvents at a level beyond the\nindividual molecular properties. For this purpose, using a multivariate\ntechnique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows many potentially\ncorrelated parameters to be reduced to a small number of descriptors. For the solvent data, PCA identified 5 principal\ncomponents, enabling a model to be generated to distribute the solvents\nin 5-dimensional space (PC1 through PC5). There have been various\nreports on utilizing PCA for the analysis of solvents though a facile\nmethod to understand this is that when considering how a solvent may\ninteract with a solute, there are several potential mechanisms that\nmay be at play, which may all depend to varying degrees of different\nproperties of the solvent molecule under consideration. Given this, PCA is an established method to\n“combine” and “weight” a series of experimental/computed\nproperties of a solvent into discrete parameters (PC1, PC2, etc.)\nto enable benchmarking/comparison studies of solvents to be carried\nout effectively using the selection tool. The default view in\nthe tool is the projection in the plane of\nthe most dominant descriptors (PC1, PC2), and initial validation of\nthe tool can be derived when one visualizes solvents with the same\nprimary functionality (homologues within the same series) across these\ntwo vectors with the outcome that they occur in very close proximity\nto each other on the plot. From a high-level perspective, PC1 is the\ndominant descriptor representing a global lipophilicity (hydrophobicity)-polarity\nscale, while PC2 captures the next most significant characteristics\nand provides a representation of the hydrogen-bonding ability of a\nsolvent. Subsequent PCs (PC3–PC5) account for progressively\nsmaller amounts of the total variance, signifying finer distinctions\nin a solvent’s properties (volume, 3D shape, surface area,\netc.). Within the analysis, it is important to bear in mind that a\nspecific property/molecular descriptor can be embedded into multiple\nPCs though with a variation in terms of its weighting/contribution\nto that global property. In addition to validation of the generated\nPCA map through observed clustering of a related chemical series of\nesters, correlation with observed chemical phenomena (keto-enol tautomerism, O- vs C-alkylation, rates of SNAr reactions, etc.) provides further authentication of the value\nof this approach. While it is intuitive to infer that those solvents\nin proximity on the map are similar, this may not be the case in all\ndimensions, demonstrating that solvents that at first inspection appear\nvery different (for example, in terms of functionality) may offer\nmore similarities than simple chemical functionality may suggest,\nthus highlighting the value of this approach (Figure \n). While the background to how the data are\ncompiled and validated is useful to know, many users can exploit the\ntool simply to provide a graphical view of the solvent shortlist. ACS-GCIPR\nsolvent selection tool: Comparing solvents through PCA\nanalysis. Figure \n illustrates\ntwo high-level scenarios in which the value of utilization of the\nsolvent selection tool might be realized. The first is a screening\nscenario in which a new reaction is being considered, and it is not\nclear what is required in terms of solvent properties for the application\n(Figure \na). The remit\nbeing screening already implies that there is only limited information\navailable to start a search, and as such the exercise is truly holistic.\nHerein identifying an initial hit is useful, and then applying appropriate\nfilters will provide a shortlist of possible alternatives to evaluate.\nGiven the nature of the exercise, avoiding aggressive application\nof the filters is beneficial. Furthermore, when the desired view has\nbeen generated, a selection of representative solvent candidates from\ndiscrete quadrants will provide a first-pass evaluation as to the\ndesirable property space for the solvent for the transformation under\ninvestigation. Utilization of the ACS-GCIPR solvent selection tool: (a)\nScreening\nfor new potential reaction solvents; (b) Solvent optimization/replacement. A second scenario is perhaps more clear-cut being\nan optimization\nin which an initial hit is known (perhaps identified through screening),\nthough replacement options are desired (Figure \nb). In this case, it is reasonable to expect\nthat proximal solvents to the initial hit on the PCA map will provide\nsome degree of “similar” behavior. With this, applying\nfilters to a localized subset should provide a reasonable starting\npoint, while expanding/reducing the scope of these criteria is possible\ndepending on the scope/goals of the optimization study. In this scenario,\nthe tool serves as an “idea generator” and evaluating\nacross the various components while filtering using the properties\noptions allows a user to generate a “shortlist” that\ncan then be experimentally evaluated through a further screening campaign.\nThe ease of use and speed of the tool allow this to be achieved in\na relatively expeditious manner."

      "title": "Analysis of Solvent Usage in Common Reactions",
      "text": "Often,\nthe selection of a solvent for a specific transformation is based\non legacy experience, and given this and the established nature of\norganic synthesis, we hypothesized that certain synthetic transformations\nare more likely to rely on hazardous or problematic solvents than\nothers. Given this, we sought to gain a more thorough understanding\non which reaction classes have placed a strong reliance on what we\nwould consider to be poor solvent selections. To achieve this, we\nrevisited the solvent usage habits across the Medicinal Chemistry\ncommunity by surveying what reaction media were used for the most\nrecurrent synthetic transformation classes as previously identified\nfrom the experimentals of J. Med. Chem. by Brown\nand Bostrom in 2016.\n,\n In addition to these fundamental\nreactions, the central role that heterocyclic systems play in medicinal\nchemistry is also taken into account with the analysis extended to\nevaluate “heterocyclic synthesis”, which provides data\non the solvents utilized for reactions employed in the formation of\n3, 4, 5, and 6-membered heteroatom-containing rings (N, O, and S). We conducted our SciFinder-n survey on these\ntransformations across a broader time frame (2000–2021) though\nonce again limiting the scope of our investigation to articles from J. Med. Chem. Each synthetic transformation was defined\nby a structural search with remarkably ∼70% of the total reactions\nundertaken coming from just six of the 20 classes (excluding “heterocycle\nsynthesis” from this analysis as this covers a broader range\nof reaction types) that were evaluated (Figure \n). Common transformations in medicinal chemistry\n(J. Med.\nChem. 2000–2021). A visual depiction of the solvent usage data is\ndisplayed in Figure \n in which the number\nof incidences of the use of undesirable solvents is expressed as a\npercentage of the total number of occurrences for each specific reaction\nclass. It can be noted in the analyses presented that in addition\nto granular metrics regarding the use of the unsustainable solvents\nhighlighted in this review, data on a subset of other “hazardous”\nsolvents are presented. Although this category features a range of\nsolvents that are employed on a more sporadic basis, it demonstrates\nthat benzene, pyridine, carbon tetrachloride (and other chlorinated solvents), di-iso-propyl ether\n,\n and HMPA have all been used as reaction media within\nmedicinal chemistry programs, and as with the featured unsustainable\nsolvents, replacing these materials in reactions of interest is strongly\nrecommended. Percentage uses of the solvents/reaction class. Overall, evaluating the data, it can clearly be\nseen that across\nall reaction classes the use of the problematic solvents DMF and DCM\nis prevalent, though despite this and the lesser use of solvents such\nas Et2O, DME, dioxane, DCE, and NMP, the latter group still\nsees significant use and throughout these applications, the potential\nreplacement with greener alternatives would be beneficial. In addition,\nthe data demonstrate that often a specific solvent is selected for\na discrete reaction class, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that solvent\nselection is often based on legacy experience. Examples of this observation\ninclude 1,4-dioxane for Suzuki–Miyaura (∼26%), Buchwald–Hartwig couplings (∼28%), and Boc protection/deprotections (∼11/13%); DME for Suzuki–Miyaura couplings (∼14%) and notably diethyl ether for the addition\nof organometallic reagents to electrophiles (∼17%) (e.g., Grignard\nreactions). Notably for these applications\ninvolving ethereal solvents, medicinal chemists are encouraged to\ntest more environmentally benign derivatives like 2-MeTHF and CPME (vide infra), which have been reported to perform in a comparative\nmanner to those historically used for these applications. Further analysis of these data showed\nthat among the 20 reaction\nclasses, two (amide formation and oxidation of alcohols) used unsustainable\nsolvents in ∼70% of the reported instances, while a further\ngroup of 9 transformations was performed in hazardous reaction solvents\nwith between 50% and 70% probability (Figure \n). In contrast, only 7 of the reaction classes\nwere performed in undesirable solvents less than 40% of the number\nof times that they were reported. Almost half of the ∼35k amine\nalkylations were reported in undesirable solvents with 33% using DMF.\nSimilarly, ester formation (∼15k hits) was also carried out\n∼50% of the time using undesirable solvents (DCM 31%, DMF 13%),\nwhich is somewhat surprising given that these could be avoided if\nenvironmentally benign reaction media such as alcoholic systems are\nused with an acid catalyst. The exponential growth of Pd-mediated\ncouplings over the past 20 years is highlighted by ∼29k examples\nof Suzuki–Miyaura couplings being reported in the journal with\nover half of these using hazardous solvents most notably those that\nare potential carcinogens (1,4-dioxane 26%; DME 14%).\n, Overall utilization of nonsustainable/hazardous solvents. While these data are interesting, it is perhaps\nmore instructive\nto focus on what solvent choices are made for the most popular reactions\ncurrently carried out within medicinal chemistry programs. The most\npopular is amide bond formation, which is reported on >63k occasions\nutilizing DCM or DMF in 28% or 36% respectively of those instances.\n,\n In contrast, the formation of heterocycles represents the second\nmost prevalent transformation (∼56k) using hazardous solvents\n∼32% of the time with either DCM or DMF being employed equally\nin almost two-thirds of these occurrences. Strategies commonly invoked\nfor SAR investigations involve employing reactions to efficiently\nforge carbon-heteroatom bonds around the periphery of a core bioactive\nscaffold. Several transformations allow for the robust formation of\nC–N bonds with broad substrate scope enabling their application\nin parallel library format to access collections of related molecules\nto expedite SAR studies. Specifically, from our data, C­(sp2)–N/O bond formation (most notably Buchwald-Hartwig couplings),\nnitrogen alkylation, and reductive amination are exemplified on ∼64k occasions with\n47% of these being carried out in solvents, which are “undesirable”.\nFor each of these transformations, one can easily identify research\nopportunities to develop replacements for dioxane (28%, C­(sp2-N/O bond formation), DMF (33%, nitrogen alkylation) and chlorinated\nmedia (29%, reductive amination) for these reactions. There are ∼39k reports of Boc deprotections,\nand the data from these highlight one of the challenges often faced\nwithin a Discovery Chemistry environment. Herein for convenience,\na commercial solution of HCl in 1,4-dioxane (4 M) is extensively utilized\nas the reagent, thus leading to ∼13% of the reactions being\ncarried out using this solvent (this is like the statement above regarding\nthe use of diethyl ether for Grignard reactions given that many of\nthese reagents are supplied commercially as solutions in this solvent). DCM is also extensively used for Boc deprotections\n(∼33% of the time, typically with TFA) while DMF is also often encountered (∼12%) in this\ntransformation. It is worth noting that all three of these solvents\n(DCM, dioxane, and DMF) are also regularly used in reactions to install\nthe Boc-protecting group. One further observation from the data is\nthat there is a significant disparity in the reaction data between\nthe number of instances in which a Boc-protecting group is installed\nas opposed to its removal, with the latter dominating by almost 10-fold.\nAt first glance, this would appear to be counterintuitive as one would\nexpect these reactions to be somewhat equivalent. However, discovery\nchemistry programs rely to a large degree on the commercial availability\nof orthogonally protected building blocks and monomers to elaborate\ncompounds to investigate chemical space. Given this within our programs,\nthe Boc-protected amine is often employed as a starting material,\nand thus, only the removal is carried out within our laboratories. From our survey, the six transformations described thus far account\nfor almost 70% of the reactions described with the remaining 14 reaction\nclasses accounting for the remainder. However, distinct trends emerge in the analysis of this subset of\ndata. Notably, the reduction of aromatic nitro groups to anilines\nappears to exhibit the most benign solvent profile with this typically\ncarried out in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, EtOAc, and THF\nin contrast to examples in more problematic reaction media (13%). Perhaps this is not surprising given that this\ntransformation is often carried out via hydrogenation with a heterogeneous\ncatalyst and the typical solvents used\npresent favorable properties in terms of both solubilizing the gas\nand facilitating the mass transfer between the three phases. While selecting a potential solvent for this\nreaction, one can prioritize using either an alcohol or EtOAc for\nthis transformation, specifically when the significant energy considerations\nassociated with the manufacture of THF are considered. This though\nis very much the exception with, for example, DMF being frequently\nused across phenol alkylation (35%), ester formation (13%), O-debenzylation\n(6%) and C­(sp2)–N/C­(sp2)–O bond\nformations (7%). As noted, the latter also frequently uses dioxane\n(28%), while another ethereal solvent DME is employed in ∼14%\nof Suzuki–Miyaura couplings. The analysis of this subset of\nreaction classes also highlights DCM as a “go-to” solvent\nfor numerous transformations including alcohol oxidations (54%, often\nin tandem with the Dess–Martin periodinane of related hypervalent-iodine-based\nreagents), sulfonamide synthesis (40%),\nester formation (31%) O- (20%), and N-debenzylations (15%). A rationale\npresented for the prevalent use of solvents such as DMF and DCM in\nmedicinal chemistry is often their ability to solubilize a broad range\nof organic molecules, though AI/ML-based\npredictive methods for compound solubility are emerging, which may\nprovide an opportunity to select more sustainable reaction media based\nspecifically on the substrate of interest. With these data in hand, one can immediately reach the conclusion\nthat significant impacts in terms of sustainability can be gained\nwithin a medicinal chemistry program simply by developing “greener”\nconditions specifically with the use of more environmentally benign\nsolvents for the transformation. To achieve this, the data were further\nrefined to highlight not only the most recurrent reaction classes\nbut also those that typically employ undesirable solvents. This led\nus to identify the following 12 transformations, which would benefit\nfrom greener reaction conditions with the numbers in parentheses representing\nan approximate “count” of the occasions that this reaction\nhas been performed in a hazardous solvent in the period under review.\nThese are amide formation (45k), Boc deprotection (26k), amine alkylation\n(18k), synthesis of heterocycles (18k), Suzuki–Miyaura coupling\n(16k), ester hydrolysis (9k), reductive amination (8k), sulfonamide\nsynthesis (8k), ester hydrolysis (8k), phenol alkylation (7k), C­(sp2)–N/C­(sp2)–O bond formations (4k),\nand oxidation of alcohols (4k). However, despite what might appear\nto be a somewhat bleak outlook, from our extensive literature review,\nfor all of these transformations noted here, there exist numerous\nexamples in which the reactions are conducted under more sustainable\nconditions. In the next section, a series of these have been collated\nfor each transformation in a readily accessible format, thus enabling\nthese to be investigated as potential “first-pass” conditions\nupon encountering a new substrate without the need for extensive literature\nresearch."

      "title": "Toward Greener Conditions for Commonly Used Transformations",
      "text": "There are several approaches that can be adopted to pursue greener\nconditions for a specific transformation under investigation. As highlighted,\nthe choice of solvent plays a major role in assessing the overall\nsustainability of the reaction not only through the relative volume\nof possible waste generated but also through its potentially undesirable\nproperties (toxicity, etc.). Considering this, the strategy of straight\nsubstitution of the solvent for a more sustainable medium presents\na logical path forward, and this can be greatly facilitated using\na solvent guide as previously discussed. This has successfully been\nimplemented and reported on several occasions for example, the replacement\nof DCM with 2-MeTHF for amide bond formations, switching DMF for more\nrecently developed polar aprotic solvents like cyrene or dimethyl isosorbide in SNAr reactions,\nand replacing ether with 2-MeTHF for Grignard chemistry. An extension\nof this approach is offered through the solvent selection tool, which\nenables the user to utilize the most desirable properties that the\nreaction medium should possess to mediate the transformation of interest\n(polarity, pKa etc.) and then apply these to identify\nsolvents that may be of value. With a specific transformation\nin mind, the ACS-GCIPR Reagents Guide presents an excellent resource\nin providing a starting point for conditions to explore for a given\nreaction. Currently this tool covers 29 transformations demonstrating\nfor each the possible reagents to be utilized in a simple Venn diagram\nformat, in which conditions are assigned based on criteria around\n“wide substrate scope”, “applicability to scale”,\nand “greenness”. Naturally those results found at the\nintersection of the three circles represent a “sweet spot”\nin terms of overall applicability and sustainability (Figure \n). However, within medicinal\nchemistry programs, the objective is often speed, and as such, conditions\nthat have been shown previously to have worked for a wide variety\nof examples are the most compelling, though these are often found\nto not be particularly attractive from a green perspective. Annotated\nACS-GCIPR reagent guide Venn diagram (alcohol oxidation). The strategies so far discussed focus on either\nthe choice of solvent\nor reagent selection for a specific transformation, which overlooks\nthe fact that these two discrete parameters are often critically interrelated.\nOn most occasions when a medicinal chemist is confronted with a new\nchemical series to work on, they will search a database (either a\ncommercial offering such as SciFinder or an institutional ELN: Electronic\nLab Notebook) for reactions that have been run on similar substrates\nto provide initial conditions to test. With this workflow, it is highly\nlikely to perpetuate chemically successful, albeit nonenvironmentally\nsustainable reaction conditions given that the methods previously\nutilized were largely developed in a time when the importance of sustainability\nwas not as widely recognized. Based on our extensive data mining\ndescribed for obtaining the\nsolvent usage information, herein we propose an alternative strategy\nfor the choice of initial reaction conditions to evaluate when faced\nwith a novel chemical series. Collected in Table \n, one will find a selection of at least three\ncurrent, more environmentally sustainable conditions for each of the\nten most common reaction types observed in JMC as previously discussed.\nThe proposed conditions are ordered from “more conservative”\nat the top to “further from precedent” at the bottom,\nand we suggest that these can be utilized in situations when a medicinal\nchemist is confronted with either a new substrate/chemical series\nor perhaps even better when trying to “green” a current\nreaction. Each reaction shows a specific substrate with the reaction\nconditions and the corresponding references, thus eliminating the\nneed for the chemist to look up alternate sources, and it is envisioned\nthat Table \n will serve\nas a valuable resource for “green” conditions for the\nabove (12) most common reaction types. To assist in both its uptake\nand overall utility, a poster version of this information has been\nmade available in the Supporting Information for use as a Quick Reference Guide. The overall approach suggested\nherein is unique in not only in marrying the reagents/solvents for\na specific transformation but also for the fact that in many cases\nthe selected examples have been performed on pharmaceutically relevant\nsubstrates, thus somewhat mitigating common concerns regarding substrate\nsolubility under a specific set of reaction conditions, which is often\na major challenge when a simple “solvent swap” is implemented\nto “green” a reaction.\n,,,−"

      "text": "It\nhas been widely recognized throughout the industry that the major\ncontributors to the PMI of a chemical reaction are solvents and water,\nand while this is well established particularly in chemical development,\nmedicinal chemists often use large volumes of water and organic solvents\nparticularly in the extractive workup of chemical transformations. In fact, the elimination of such workups and\ntheir replacement with solvent swaps through distillation to telescope reaction steps represents a common strategy to drive down PMI numbers\nwithin chemical development. In order\nto assay the impact of solvent usage for workup and purification (vide infra) within the medicinal chemistry research phase,\na similar survey to that described previously was conducted of published J. Med. Chem. procedures between 2000 and 2021. To streamline\nthe analysis, a representative sampling of four publications was chosen\nfrom each year for a total of 80 publications over the 20-year span\nleading to 1874 experiments being reviewed. Of these experiments,\nit was shown that 53% utilized an extractive aqueous workup procedure\n(Figure \n).\n,\n In the remaining cases, an extractive workup is avoided either through\ndirect precipitation of solutes through addition of an antisolvent\nor through a simple evaporation to yield the crude product. In contrast to the range of solvents used for\nreactions, the options for extraction are more limited based on the\nrequirement for them to be essentially immiscible with water, and\nthose utilized in the reactions surveyed are collected in Figure \n. Pleasingly from\na sustainability perspective, over half of the analyzed reactions\nused EtOAc (54%) as the solvent for extraction. However, 31% of the reactions utilized hazardous chlorinated\nsolvents, while 7% used extremely flammable diethyl ether, which is\nalso prone to peroxide formation. The survey also clearly reveals\nthat there has been little to no uptake in medicinal chemistry settings\nof newly emerging solvents such as MTBE, CPME, and 2-MeTHF for extractions. While these solvents can serve as greener and\nsafer alternatives to diethyl ether (the flashpoint of diethyl ether\nis −40 °C, while that of 2-MeTHF is −12 °C),\n2-MeTHF also presents an alternative to dichloromethane, which as\nnoted has both health and environmental concerns. From a practical\nperspective, 2-MeTHF (unlike THF) is immiscible with water and can\nthus be used to extract products directly from reaction mixtures without\nthe formation of emulsions, which is often a challenge with dichloromethane.\nOne of the drivers often presented for the use of chlorinated solvents\nfor extraction within medicinal chemistry is that the desired products\nare often highly polar and water-soluble, and as such diethyl ether\nand EtOAc are ineffective as extraction solvents. Recent work by Reetz and coworkers has identified n-butanol as an ecologically\nviable choice for such systems with this solvent proving to be particularly\neffective for the extraction of polar compounds from enzymatic processes. Furthermore, simply through reducing both the\nnumber of extractions employed during an aqueous workup and the volume\nof solvents utilized during the process can greatly reduce the overall\nPMI value of the transformation leading to a more sustainable outcome. Analysis of (a) methods of purification and\n(b) extractive workups\nin medicinal chemistry procedures. Solvents used in extractive workups (right schematic combines\nnonsustainable\nsolvents: see Table \n). In addition to workup conditions, the experimental\nprocedures were\nalso probed to assay the trends in the purification methods of choice\nwithin a medicinal chemistry setting. Of the 1874 reactions surveyed,\nca. 90% utilized a purification method of some kind (Figure \n), while the survey indicated\nthat in contrast to chemical development, telescoping reactions are\nnot regularly exploited in research settings with only 187 instances\nof this being encountered. It is self-evident that telescoping of\nreactions can lead to a reduction in solvent usage (reaction, workup,\nand purification) as well as potentially time and energy savings.\nIn contrast to development chemistry, telescoping represented only\n∼10% of this data set though this is probably not too surprising\nbased on the primary focus of the articles being the syntheses of\nmultiple discrete compounds for biological assays. The predominant\nmethod of purification (>50% of cases) was normal-phase chromatography\nusing a solid support, which in most cases is silica.\n,\n This group has previously published on concepts around “sustainability\nchromatography” providing not only a roadmap of potential alternatives\nto avoid chromatography but also suggested “greener”\nreplacements to commonly used mobile phases. The popularity of this method of purification has no doubt been\nmaintained through the ease of accessibility of simple to use, automated\nsystems that are prevalent throughout medicinal chemistry laboratories. The survey indicated that the predominant nonpolar\neluant in normal-phase chromatography was hexane, though from a Green\nChemistry perspective, this solvent should be replaced with cyclohexane\nor more preferably heptane (Figure \na). These latter solvents are significantly less toxic\nand thus have higher occupational exposure limits than hexane. The\nlower volatility of heptane compared to both hexane and pentane also\nleads to lower emissions and decreased environmental impact while\nalso representing less of a fire hazard. From a practical standpoint,\nthe higher boiling point of heptane often allows compounds to be precipitated\ndirectly upon evaporation of heptane/EtOAc mixtures. The survey also\nindicates that dichloromethane, most commonly in combination with\nmethanol, remains a common solvent utilized in medicinal chemistry\nsettings for chromatography. This is even though practical, straightforward,\nand more environmentally responsible alternatives to this toxic solvent\nhave been evaluated and proven to be effective. In particular, the\nsurvey indicated little uptake of a 3:1 mixture of EtOAc/ethanol (polar\neluent) and heptane (nonpolar eluent) as a recommended substitution\nfor dichloromethane even though the EtOAc/EtOH blend is now commercially\navailable and a much greener solvent alternative to dichloromethane/methanol\nmixtures. HPLC was also found to be\na common technique for product purification in medicinal chemistry\nlaboratories though evaporation/lyophilization of aqueous mixtures\ncan be relatively energy intensive.\n,\n SFC is often\npromoted as a “greener” method for product purification\n,\n though the survey revealed that this is rarely utilized probably\nowing to the nature of this technique (requiring high-pressure CO2 supply) thus restricting it to specialist purification laboratories.\n,\n The ACS-GCIPR have recently developed an Analytical Method Greenness\nScore (AMGS) tool, which can be utilized to benchmark and compare\ndirectly analytical methods. The AMGS\nmetric factors in both the impact of the solvent (health, safety,\nenvironmental, and waste), the energy demands of the instrumentation\nas well as the overall technique and highlights the sustainability\nbenefits that can be gained in selecting more modernized methods and\ntechniques without compromising separation performance.\n, Analysis of solvents used in (a) chromatography and (b) alternative\nworkups/purification methods.

      "title": "The Role of Miniaturization and High-Throughput Experimentation\n(HTE) in Greener Solvent Selection and Reducing Solvent Usage",
      "text": "Within medicinal chemistry, access to milligram quantities of bioactive\ncompounds often suffices for initial profiling in relation to target\nbiology and metabolic stability, and as such the scale on which one\noperates becomes a critical consideration in minimizing waste. A successful discovery campaign will iteratively\nimprove on advanced compounds through a well-established “design,\nmake, test, analyze” cycle with\nspeed of execution being a critical factor leading to a heavy reliance\non parallel synthesis and reversed-phase/accelerated\napproaches to purification to drive\ndecision making. This oft-unstated emphasis on proceeding in an expeditious\nfashion can lead to a prioritization of compound numbers (diversity)\nat the expense of poor synthetic chemistry and thus sustainability. Miniaturization provides a complementary\nstrategy to solvent replacement in minimizing/reducing the pharmaceutical\nindustry’s footprint on global sustainability. Miniaturization and High Throughput Experimentation\n(HTE) are inseparable technologies, which have advanced in their ability\nto solve chemistry problems over the past 20 years. In one manifestation, HTE involves performing multiple\nchemical reactions in parallel, whether for the purpose of parallel\nevaluation of multiple conditions (one reaction, many sets of conditions)\nor for parallel synthesis (multiple reacting partners typically under\na common set of conditions). In comparison to reactions conducted\neither in dram vials or round-bottom flasks, decreasing the vessel\nsize to 8 × 30 mm (100 μL) or even 4 × 21 mm (25 μL)\nutilizes significantly reduced solvent volumes (Figure \n). Alternatively, reactions\ncan also be conducted in a 96-well (or 384/1536) plate format though solvent compatibility with plastics\n(e.g., polystyrene) needs to be taken into consideration. With advances in technologies such as analytical\ntechniques, tumble-stirring, inertion chambers, aluminum heating blocks, LED plates, biocatalysis, innovative approaches\nto reagent dosing, and parallel electrochemical\ndesigns, the majority of synthetic organic\nreactions can now be performed on a microscale (which we will define\nas ≤1 mg of substrate per reaction). Hypothetically, an array of 40 microscale reactions consumes the\nsame quantity of substrate (and solvent) as a single reaction at a\n1 mL scale (Figure \n).

      "text": "The Medicinal Chemistry Focus team of ACS-GCIPR\nhas conducted a\nsystematic survey of the most common synthetic transformations that\nhave been carried out within the drug discovery phase over the past\ntwo decades. While these reactions are often performed on a relatively\nsmall scale (milligrams to grams), the amount of solvent utilized\nand waste generated is significant given that over 400k reactions\nare profiled here. The data clearly indicate that the use of unsustainable/hazardous\nsolvents is prevalent within the medicinal chemistry community with\nover 40% of the reactions being performed in undesirable chlorinated,\ndipolar aprotic, ethereal, or hydrocarbon-based solvents with two\ntransformations (including amide-bond formation, which is the most\nprevalent) using unsustainable solvents in over 70% of the instances\nsurveyed.

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nWith society placing a greater focus on\nthe long-term well-being\nof the environment and an increased onus on corporate social responsibility\nto achieve this, over the last two decades the pharmaceutical industry\nhas expended a significant effort on improving the sustainability\nof their chemical processes. Pivotal to\nthis initiative has been the formation of the American Chemical Society\nGreen Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS-GCIPR), and metrics from members of this group have led\nto an estimate that solvents utilized in such processes contribute\nto 80–90% in terms of the mass of waste streams and 75–80%\nof the overall life cycle impact of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. Despite this study being carried out 15 years\nago, marginal improvements in decreasing solvent use for small molecule\nAPI (active pharmaceutical ingredient) have been offset not only by\nthe increasing complexity of the molecules being synthesized but also\nby the growth of new therapeutic modalities such as peptides and oligonucleotides, which when performed using classical solid-phase methodologies are\nhighly solvent-intensive particularly through the multiple resin-washing\ncycles involved. While the value of employing a solvent and the roles\nthat this plays in mediating the transformations of organic compounds\ninto more complex molecules is well recognized, the extensive use\nof such materials has prompted scientists to study and seek to benchmark\nthe health, safety and environmental (HSE) scores for a diverse array\nof solvents leading to the development of various guides to enable\njudicious decisions to be made in terms of selection. Typically, these guides either prepared by individual companies\nor consortia such as the ACS-GCIPR are in good agreement as to which\nsolvents present greater hazards to the user as well as the deleterious\neffects that they pose to the environment. However, while the value\nof the metrics presented on the volumes of solvent utilized in the\nindustry is unquestionable, these have centered exclusively on amounts\nemployed in late development or manufacturing campaigns to produce\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and to the best of our knowledge, there are no systematic accounts\nthat accurately document solvent use in the early exploratory stages\nof the drug discovery process when chemical synthesis plays an extensive\nrole in the production of milligram amounts of potentially thousands\nof compounds for evaluation against a specific therapeutic target.\nOne rationale presented for this is that herein access to the required\ncompound is the primary goal, and while intensive synthetic efforts\nare dedicated to deliver the variety of analogs required for SAR (structure\nactivity relationship) studies, these often entail the use of suboptimal,\nlow-yielding fit-for-purpose synthesis routes on milligram scale.\nApplication of conventional metrics such as Process Mass Intensity\n(PMI) to these endeavors is both inconsistent and of questionable\noverall value with high values usually being obtained as result of\nthe low yields and chromatographic purification methods that are typically\nutilized. Taken out of context though,\nPMI metrics (or similar quantitative measures) on chemistry at the\nearly stage of drug development strongly imply that sustainability\nconsiderations do not play a role in the selection of the seemingly\nnonefficient synthetic routes applied, and that the opportunity to\ndevelop more green approaches to lead compounds only becomes a tangible\nconsideration as a molecule progresses toward further development\nas a potential clinical candidate. In\ndiscovery chemistry, the scale of operations is often cited to mitigate\nthese metrics though the waste streams generated and subsequent environmental\nimpact may not be as negligible compared to multikilogram development\nand manufacturing campaigns as one envisions particularly given the\nsheer number of ongoing medicinal chemistry projects and therefore\ncompounds being synthesized globally at any one time. In fact, while it is commonly believed that multistep synthesis\non milligram scales minimally impacts sustainability, it has been\nestimated that up to 3.5 million kilograms of waste are generated\nfrom drug discovery through preclinical studies. Furthermore, placing the sole reliance for the investigation/implementation\nof more sustainable approaches to candidate compounds on the Chemical\nDevelopment department creates significant resource pressures for\ngroups whose primary objectives are based on time-sensitive deliveries\nof high-quality materials intended for critical clinical studies. Despite the known hazards of many substances\nthat are utilized\ncommonly as solvents within Medicinal chemistry laboratories, the\nextensive role(s) and as such the inherent need for a solvent in a\nchemical reaction are well recognized. While solvent minimization is a viable strategy in attaining more\nfavorable Green Chemistry outcomes (prevention of waste), the choice\nof solvent is also critical with the use of benign solvents (principle\n5) and the desire to do less hazardous chemistry (numbers 3 and 12)\nhighlighted in the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry. In addition, considerations, such as choosing materials\nderived from renewable feedstocks and considering how easy they are\nto remove, are important factors. There are several solvent selection\ntools to aid in this endeavor, as discussed below. One factor that\nis important to bear in mind when making solvent selection for a specific\nreaction is the concept of solvent class, as often a more judicious\nchoice of the medium in which to carry out the reaction can be made\nthrough switching to a related member of the family without losing\nany of the benefits. An important concept with this strategy is that,\nwhereas naturally all chemicals/substances have some drawbacks from\nan environmental/sustainability perspective, seeking to minimize these\nis at the core of the decision made. The ACS-GCIPR Medicinal Chemistry subteam was created in 2012 with\none of its key initiatives being to both raise awareness and educate\npractitioners of the importance and positive downstream impact in\ndeveloping more sustainable synthetic routes in early discovery campaigns. Integral and perhaps most challenging to this\nobjective are to establish a mindset for a researcher to consider\nand implement green chemistry right from the outset and to unequivocally\ndemonstrate that many legacy notions that to achieve this in a fast-paced\ndrug discovery environment are incorrect. With these objectives in mind, herein we focus on the potential\nimpact of solvent usage in medicinal chemistry programs through an\nin-depth analysis of experimental data from the Journal of Medicinal\nChemistry given that this will serve as a representative reflection\nof the synthetic routes employed in an early drug discovery setting. To further cement the validity of this data\nset, a period of 20 years (2000–2020) was selected to provide\nan accurate illustration of the trends involved, most notably capturing\nthe promotion of new greener solvent alternatives as well as emerging\nchemical methodologies and associated solvent requirements disclosed\nduring an extended time phase. Not only are the solvents utilized\nin specific recurrent chemical transformations considered here but\nalso those that are employed in both workups and purifications. Furthermore,\nwe discuss the drivers and incentives for making judicious solvent\nselections at an early stage, most notably that such decisions can\naccelerate a program through development by avoiding further route\nchanges/optimizations necessitated through a requirement to switch\nthe reaction media. It is important to note that the study reported\nhere evaluates HSE score criteria based on NFPA (National Fire Protection\nAssociation) ratings using the ACS-GCIPR and CHEM21 solvent selection\nguides, though other such reports provide similar guidance about the\nselection of solvent replacements. This perspective also suggests\na series of preferred conditions from a sustainability perspective\nfor the top ten most common transformations reported in the medicinal\nchemistry literature, while strategies based on miniaturization explicitly\nusing High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) are discussed as a mechanism\nto both reduce solvent volumes and accelerate the identification of\nmore suitable solvents/conditions for a specific transformation. There are numerous sources of information\navailable that provide researchers with details regarding the safety\nand hazards inherent to a specific solvent/substance that is being\nused. Perhaps most valuable is the MSDS\n(Material Safety Data Sheet, sometimes referred to as an SDS that\ncontains the same information) that is supplied with all materials\nand can be easily accessed from a vendor’s Web site. The MSDS is defined as a document that provides\nworkers with procedures for safely handling or working with a particular\nsubstance (Figure \n). Many companies will also retain an internal repository/database\nof these as part of their Health and Safety groups. While variations\noccur in the appearance of the MSDS based on the source, these documents\nare typically templated and consist of 16 sections with sections 1\nand 2 dealing with the identification of the substance (and the supplier)\nand a high-level description of the hazards, respectively. Section\n3 describes the specification of the ingredients, while measures addressing\nFirst Aid, Firefighting, and Accidental Release are the topics for\nsections 4 through 6. Section 7 talks of the handling and storage\nof the material, while section 8 focuses on the exposure controls\nand necessary personal protection for working with the substance in\nquestion. Sections 9 and 10 report the physical/chemical properties\nand the stability/reactivity characteristics of the material in question,\nwhile sections 11 and 12 provide information on toxicological and\necological studies. Sections 13 and 14 provide guidance for the disposal\nand transportation of the chemical substance, with section 15 addressing\ninformation regarding regulatory listings. Section 16 is provided\nto disclose any relevant information that has not been captured elsewhere\nin the document. Representative MSDS with the section descriptors. Table \n summarizes\nsome of the properties of these solvents that we will provide an overview\nof in this section. Based on space constraints, this is obviously\nnot a complete list nor is the following discussion an exhaustive\noverview as detailed reports of numerous reports on physical properties,\nreactivity, and ecological and toxicological profiles of each solvent\nexist in the primary literature. The table includes thermal characteristics such as\nboiling point,\nflash point, and autoignition temperature. The latter two are often\nconfused, the flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature\nat which its vapors will ignite if given an ignition source, while\nthe autoignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a\nsubstance will spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere without\na source of ignition. The NFPA rating system (NFPA 704) provides a\nsimple visual representation mainly intended for emergency personnel\ndealing with a fire or spill to indicate the health (blue), flammability\n(red), reactivity (yellow) and special (white) hazards associated\nwith a specific material. Different colored\nsectors are employed to represent the distinct hazards with a number\nrating system of 0–4 (0 representing the least and 4 representing\nthe greatest risk) utilized to rate each of these on the diamond displayed\non the container of the substance. Figure \n provides an overview of the criteria applied\nto assign ratings to materials for each hazard. NFPA rating system. Other labeling systems (HMIS, OSHA HazCom) are\nalso often used\nthough they are not discussed here. The\nexplosive limits for a solvent specify the concentration range of\na material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an\nignition source and are usually expressed as the percent volume of\nthe material in the air. The Lower Explosive\nLimit (LEL) is the lowest concentration of vapor that will burn in\nair and for most flammable gases, it is less than 5% by volume, while\nthe Upper (or higher) Explosive Limit (UEL) is the highest concentration\nof a vapor above which a flame will not spread in the presence of\nan ignition source. It is important to note that percentages higher\nthan the UEL are considered to be “too rich to burn”. The LC50 and LD50 data tabulated provide\na relative assessment to the toxicity of a specific solvent and should\nbe considered in context. Specifically,\ntoxicity is divided into multiple categories based on the duration\nof exposure. Acute toxicity is typically\nassociated with a single exposure over a relatively short time, while\nchronic toxicity addresses repeated or long-term exposure that occurs\nover months to years. LD50 is used to describe acute toxicity and is the median lethal oral\n(or dermal) dose predicted to cause death in 50% of the test animals. The values are expressed in milligrams of compound\nper kilogram of body weight of the test species (mg/kg). While LD50 is the lethal dose, LC50 refers to the lethal\nconcentration and is utilized for inhalation-based studies (the values\nfor the latter can be reported in mg/L, mg/m3, or ppm). Comparisons are often challenging, as it is\nimportant to remember that estimates of the LD50 are specific\nto the test animals used in the study and variability is observed\nnot only between species but also between different studies. As a guideline, compounds with an oral LD50 of 0–50 mg/kg are considered highly toxic, while\nan LD50 of >2000 mg/kg is associated with a material\nof\nlow toxicity. Various assessments such as the Hodge/Sterner or Gosselin/Smith/Hodge\nscales can be used to compare and provide a more granular description\nof LD50 values, and extensive\ndatabases are available typically through subscription such as the\nRegistry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS). Even though the hazards presented by several\nsolvents are well\nunderstood, there are several that still find widespread use and for\nsome reactions/tasks represent the preferred choice in Medicinal Chemistry\nsynthesis programs despite their unsustainable nature (Figure \n). These solvents come from specific solvent classes, namely hydrocarbon, chlorinated, ethereal,\nand dipolar aprotic solvents with several\nrecent reviews providing a broad overview of their applications in\nsynthetic chemistry. A brief overview of each of the solvents is provided\nin the following sections with more detailed information around the\nhazards of these materials discussed in the Supporting Information. Nonsustainable solvents commonly used in medicinal chemistry. n-Hexane is a very volatile\naliphatic hydrocarbon that is insoluble in water and is commonly used\nas a solvent in medicinal chemistry laboratories most notably in chromatographic\nseparations. Caution must be exercised,\nas flammable vapors from this solvent may dissipate away from a spill\nand represent an explosion hazard. The odor threshold for hexane is\n130 ppm with the solvent reported to have a “faint, peculiar”\nodor. Various grades of hexane(s) are\navailable with the laboratory solvent n-hexane containing\napproximately 99% n-hexane, while “hexane”\nor “hexanes” is a commercial and industrial product\nconsisting of a mixture of n-hexane and its isomers\n2-methyl- and 3-methyl-pentane along with a small number of other\nhydrocarbons. 1,4-Dioxane is a colorless liquid that is commonly\nused as a solvent in medicinal chemistry laboratories most notably\nas a reaction solvent. It is completely\nmiscible with water and, in fact hygroscopic. The NFPA instability\nrating for this solvent is primarily based on its propensity for the\nformation of explosive peroxides, and robust, stringent testing criteria\n(date of opening, periodic testing, and prompt, appropriate disposal\nscheduled) should be established to ensure these do not become an\nissue. Crystals observed in the liquid\npotentially suggest that peroxidation has already occurred, and the\nproduct should be considered to be extremely dangerous. Then, and\nif peroxide formation is suspected, the container should not be opened\nor moved. With respect to flammable vapors,\nthese may dissipate away from a spill and may represent an explosion\nhazard. The odor threshold for 1,4-dioxane is 12 ppm with the solvent\nreported to have a “mild faint-sweet ether-like” odor.\n1,4-Dioxane is regulated by OSHA and is on the Special Health Hazard\nSubstance List because it is a carcinogen and is flammable. 1,2-Dimethoxyethane (DME) is a\ncolorless liquid with a sharp odor (no information available on the\nodor threshold) resembling petroleum distillates that finds used in\nresearch laboratories as a higher boiling alternative to both diethyl\nether and THF. It is often referred to\nby a variety of other names such as glyme, monoglyme, dimethyl glycol,\nethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and dimethyl cellosolve, and finds\nmore extensive use as the low-viscosity component of the solvent for\nelectrolytes of lithium batteries. It\nis completely miscible with water and has found applications as an\nalternative solvent for Grignard reactions as well as being used for\na functional solvent to provide homogeneous conditions for Pd-mediated\ncross-coupling reactions. Containers\nof DME may explode when heated, with vapors forming potentially explosive\nmixtures with air with the possibility of the vapors originating from\nthe source of ignition and causing flashback. As with many ether-based\nsolvents, explosive peroxide formation represents a significant concern,\nparticularly when the material is distilled, evaporated, or otherwise\nconcentrated. As noted previously, robust, stringent testing criteria\n(date of opening and periodic testing) should be established to ensure\nthat this does not become an issue. Diethyl ether is a colorless liquid that\nis for practical purposes immiscible with water (solubility 6.05 g/100\nmL at 25 °C), and possesses a pungent, sweetish, aromatic-like\nodor with a reported odor threshold of 0.83 ppm in air. While commonly used as a solvent in research\nlaboratories perhaps most notably as a solvent to facilitate crystallizations/extractions\nor solvent for organometallic reactions, diethyl ether is probably\nmore generally known as being extensively used as a general anesthetic. However, owing to its high flammability making\nthe solvent incompatible with modern surgical techniques as well as\nreports of abnormal liver function tests from patients anesthetized\nusing diethyl ether, its use in the medical setting is now obsolete. The flammability is widely cited as the major\nhazard associated with this solvent, and the compound is on the Special\nHealth Hazard Substance List due to this. Containers may explode when\nheated, with vapors forming potentially explosive mixtures with air\nwith the possibility of the vapors originating to the source of ignition\nand causing flashback. Again, the formation of explosive peroxides\nover time represents a significant concern, and containers should\nbe dated upon opening and tested periodically for the presence of\nperoxides. Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE or sometimes TBME) is on the Hazardous\nSubstance List as it is cited in by ACGIH, DOT, DEP, IARC, IRIS, and\nEPA, and it is also on the Special Health Hazard Substance List because\nof its flammability. It is reported to\nsmell like turpentine (like petroleum distillates) with other descriptors\nof its odor being “bitter”, “fruity”,\nor akin to a “cleaning-agent”. The odor threshold is\nreported to be between 0.09 and 0.13 ppm though such values tend to\nbe somewhat broad and as such smell alone should not be relied upon\nto determine potential exposure. MTBE\nis used as an octane booster in gasoline, as well as a solvent in chemical manufacture and in medicine to\nfacilitate the dissolution of gallstones. In research laboratories, MTBE is promoted as a safer alternative\nto diethyl ether and is used for many of the same purposes (such as\nreactions and to facilitate precipitations). Specific advantages to support this include a higher boiling point,\nreduced water solubility, and a lesser tendency for the formation\nof peroxides. It is flammable, and containers\nmay explode upon heating with the vapors having the potential to form\nexplosive mixtures with air. In addition, vapors may travel back to\na source of ignition, leading to flashback. Dichloromethane (methylene chloride,\nDCM) is on the Right to Know Hazardous Substance List owing to being\ncited by the full gamut of regulatory agencies (OSHA, EPA, ACGIH,\nDOT, NIOSH, NTP, NFPA, IARC, and DEP), as well as on the Special Health\nHazard Substance List. The compound is\na colorless, volatile liquid with a sweet smell with the odor threshold\ncited between 25 to 150 ppm (note: odor thresholds vary widely and\nshould not be relied on solely in determining potentially hazardous\nexposures). Regarding exposure, dichloromethane\nmay be a carcinogen in humans, and as such there is no considered\nsafe level of exposure and all contact should be reduced to the lowest\npossible level. Despite this, the solvent\nwas widely used in paint and varnish removal products and is still employed in research laboratories as a reaction\nmedium, extensively for liquid/liquid\nextractions (dichloromethane is immiscible with water) and for chromatographic\nseparations. Dichloromethane has no flash\npoint under conventional conditions though it is flammable (flash\npoint −7 °C) when exposed to O2 gas. Dichloromethane can also form flammable vapor-air\nmixtures above 100 °C and has an autoignition temperature of\n556 °C. Although dichloromethane may burn, it does not readily\nignite though poisonous gases including hydrogen chloride and phosgene\nare produced in a fire. Similarly, to dichloromethane, chloroform\nis listed on both the Right to Know Hazardous Substance List and the\nSpecial Health Hazard Substance List. Chloroform is a colorless liquid\nreported to have a pleasant, sweet smell, with an odor threshold between\n2.4 and 85 ppm, though as noted odor thresholds vary greatly and odor\nshould not be solely relied upon to determine potentially hazardous\nexposures. Chloroform is a probable carcinogen\nin humans, and as such, there are no safe levels of exposure, and\nall contact should be reduced to the minimum possible level. Chloroform is used as a solvent and in the manufacture\nof refrigerants, resins, and plastics. As a laboratory solvent specifically both in liquid/liquid extractions\nand chromatography with dichloromethane (see above) is suggested as\na suitable replacement for chloroform though the higher boiling point\nof the latter still leads to its use in some thermally mediated reactions,\nwhile the deuterated version is widely used as an NMR solvent. Historically, chloroform was widely employed\nas an anesthetic since the 1850s, though this practice stopped after\nca. 100 years owing to both the complications encountered in controlled\nadministration of an effective dose as well as the development of\nsafer alternatives. Chloroform has a\nboiling point of 61 °C, with no flash point (caution should be\nexercised herein as chloroform often contains ethanol, which is volatile\nand flammable, as a stabilizer) or autoignition temperature. No explosive\nlimits are reported for chloroform though explosions of sealed containers\nhave occurred through reactions with acetone and/or strong bases. In a fire, it should also be noted that chloroform\ncan lead to the production of poisonous gases. While 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) may\nbe a carcinogen and, as such, is listed on the Right to Know Hazardous\nSubstance as well as the Special Health Hazard Substance Lists, unlike\nDCM and chloroform, DCE is also a flammable solvent. DCE is a colorless\nliquid reported to have a pleasant smell with an odor threshold of\nbetween 88 and 400 ppm, though due to variances herein, this should\nnot alone be used to determine hazardous exposures. As a possible carcinogen, there are no safe levels of exposure\nand therefore all contact should be reduced to as low a level as possible. In addition to its use as a laboratory solvent,\nDCE is widely used to make vinyl chloride and is a key step in the manufacture of PVC and was historically\nused as an antiknock additive in gasoline. DCE has a boiling point of 83 °C thus representing a higher\nboiling option to both the previously discussed chlorinated solvents,\nand forms azeotropes with many other solvents including water (at\na boiling point of 71 °C) despite being immiscible with the latter. The utility of DCE though as a solvent can to\nsome degree be limited by its potential reactivity with functional\ngroups such as amines. Containers of\nDCE even when empty should be kept away from heat and sources of ignition,\nand vapors can form explosive mixtures in air and travel back to a\nsource of ignition and flashback. Thermal decomposition can lead to\nthe release of toxic and irritating gases and vapors including CO,\nCO2, hydrogen chloride, and phosgene. DMF is included on the candidate list for REACH (Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation)\nwithin the EU (ECHA – European Chemical Agency) as a substance\nof very high concern (SVHC) owing primarily to acute toxicity and\nits reported propensity to lead to adverse reproductive and developmental\neffects. In addition, it is on the Right\nto Know Hazardous Substance List, owing to citations from a broad\nrange of regulatory organizations. DMF is a colorless (though sometimes\nslightly yellow) liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water.\nIt is reported to have a fishy, unpleasant (ammonia-like) odor with\nan odor threshold of 2.2 ppm (estimates of this have varied between\n0.47 and 100 ppm again demonstrating how odor thresholds can vary\ngreatly and given this odor alone should not be taken to determine\npotential exposure). DMF is widely used\nas an industrial solvent to produce polymer fibers, films, and surface\ncoatings. In the pharmaceutical industry,\npolar aprotic solvents such as DMF are broadly used for specific subsets\nof reactions (SNAr, amide bond formation, solid-phase peptide\nsynthesis) exploiting its relatively high boiling point, and its ability\nto solubilize a wide range of drug-like molecules as well as in crystallization\nprocesses in which the miscibility with water (as an effective antisolvent)\nis taken advantage of. DMF has a boiling\npoint of 153 °C, though it is purified through distillation under\nreduced pressure to avoid potential decomposition. Although this is not reported to occur until much higher\ntemperatures, disproportionation leading to CO and dimethyl amine can be observed in some reaction media, while\nthere have been instances of DMF vapors traveling back to an ignition\nsource leading to a flashback. DMF has been extensively used\nas a solvent for synthetic reactions utilizing the widely employed\nstrong base sodium hydride. This is mainly due to the solvent’s\nability to solubilize both organic and inorganic compounds. However,\ndespite the prevalence of this practice, the hazards associated with\nthe thermal instability of NaH/DMF mixtures particularly on scale-up\nare significantly underappreciated and seldom discussed within the\nchemistry community. Thermal decomposition\nof a NaH/DMF mixture was first observed in the 1960s with further\nincidents reported since in the literature, while calorimetric studies\ndemonstrated that these mixtures can self-heat at temperatures often\nin an unpredictable manner though at temperatures as low as 26 °C.\nA more detailed report of the explosive hazard of NaH in DMF was published\nin 2019, and while this combination is rarely seen now in scale-up\nsynthetic routes, it is still utilized in medicinal chemistry laboratories,\nand this is a practice that should be highly discouraged. In a similar manner, studies have also demonstrated\nthat solutions of NBS in DMF undergo a hazardous thermal decomposition\nat low temperature with a safe working temperature for a 22 wt % solution\nestablished to be 32 °C. Probing\nthis phenomenon highlighted a possible autocatalytic mechanism for\ndecomposition with further investigations carried out to establish\nthe role of concentration/materials, etc., on both the onset temperature\nand the overall energy output. Like DMF, DMA is included on the candidate list for REACH within\nthe EU as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) owing primarily\nto acute toxicity and its reported propensity to lead to damage the\nliver. In addition, it is on the Hazardous\nSubstance List owing to citations from a range of regulatory organizations.\nDMA is a colorless liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water.\nIt is reported to have a faint ammonia-like odor with an odor threshold\nof 47 ppm though the range of accepted odor thresholds can be quite\nbroad thus highlighting that caution should be exercised in relying\non odor alone as a warning for potentially hazardous exposures. In addition to being employed in medicinal chemistry\nlaboratories, DMA is used as a solvent for plastics, resins, and gums. In research, its employment as a solvent is\noften to exploit its polarity, relatively high boiling point, and\nability to effectively solubilize a broad range of both organic and\ninorganic compounds. This miscibility with water also presents an\nopportunity in the crystallization space in which the aqueous component\nacts as an “anti-solvent”. DMA has a boiling point of 165 °C being again distilled under\nvacuum to avoid thermal disproportionation, which leads to dimethylamine\nbeing produced. DMA has a flashpoint\nof 63 °C and an autoignition temperature of 490 °C with\nthe potential for containers to explode when heated (note that both\nproduct and empty containers should be kept away from heat and sources\nof ignition). In a similar manner to DMF, DMA has also been\nwidely employed as a solvent for reactions involving the strong base\nNaH. Process safety studies have confirmed that this results in a\nmixture that possesses a propensity for self-heating with the formation\nof noncondensable gasesous products during thermal decomposition,\nthus presenting a viable scenario for a runaway reaction. GC studies\nherein showed that the release of H2 occurred at a lower\ntemperature than with the NaH/DMF sample with methane, ethane, acetylene,\nand CO also been observed as being formed. Avoiding using NaH/DMA\neven in discovery-scale reactions is strongly recommended. NMP (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone)\nis reported on the REACH authorization list as an SVHC owing to its\ntoxicity profile specifically that the compound may be a teratogen\nin humans leading to malformation of embryos. In addition, it causes severe irritation to the skin and eyes and\nmay irritate the lungs. NMP is also listed on both the Right to Know\nHazardous Substance List (cited by DOT, DEP, NFPA, and EPA) and the\nSpecial Health Hazard Substance List. NMP is a colorless, hygroscopic\nliquid noted to have a “mild-amine”, fishy-like smell\nwith an odor threshold reported to be between 4 and 10 ppm though\nodor should not solely be used as an indicator to determine potential\nexposure. NMP is a combustible liquid\nand should be kept away from heat, sparks, and sources of ignition.\nNMP is widely used as a solvent in a variety of industries including\npaints/coatings removal, petrochemical processing, agricultural chemicals,\nelectronics cleaning, and industrial/domestic cleaning. The high boiling point of this solvent is exploited\nin synthetic chemistry, for example, in Cu-based Ullmann couplings, and again the miscibility with water can be\ntaken advantage of in developing suitable crystallizations for emerging\ndrug development candidates. With the hazards\nof several solvents established, it is important to consider what\nrole solvents play in a reaction, and what resources are available\nto inform the decisions made in selecting them. Specifically, the use of a solvent is key to enable mixing and mass transport between phases and can have an influence on both the rate and selectivity\n,\n of a particular\nprocess.\n,\n Perhaps the most important use\nof solvents is from a safety perspective, wherein the reaction medium\ntypically acts as a “heat sink” to control exotherms\narising from the reaction. Solvents also are widely utilized in techniques\ninvolved in product isolation and though we will not consider this\nhere, in cleaning protocols. While many\nare beyond the scope of this perspective, it is important to note\nthat several suggested “greener alternatives” have been\ninvestigated that avoid the use of a conventional reaction solvent\nincluding running reactions neat, solid-phase\nreactions as well as employing surfactants\nto enable chemistry in aqueous media or exploring emerging options for conducting reactions such as ionic\nliquids or supercritical fluids. It cannot be overemphasized how important the\nselection of a solvent is not only in dissolving and dispersing the reaction\nparticipants but also in being of the appropriate polarity to promote the chemistry (SN2, E1CB, etc.) and through modification of the solute properties\n(redox potential, pKa, H-bonding). Add to this the benefits gained through removing impurities/byproducts\nthrough partitioning, and isolation\nof the desired product by crystallization demonstrates how selection of the right solvent from the outset\ncan alleviate issues with downstream processing. The contribution of the solvent toward the Process Mass\nIntensity (PMI) of a process only exacerbates this decision and most\nnotably how the potential hazards arising from this should be minimized. The ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS-GCIPR)\nwas established in 2005 when the ACS Green Chemistry Institute and\na handful of pharmaceutical companies saw an opportunity to work together\nin a precompetitive manner to promote green chemistry and engineering\ninnovation. One of the major initiatives of the ACS-GCIPR is the development\nof a robust suite of tools that embrace\ncommonly agreed-upon metrics and support chemists’ choices\naround material and method selection to maximize resource efficiency,\nminimize hazards, and reduce waste and cost over the life cycle of\nthe process. While initially developed\nby and for the pharmaceutical industry, it should be emphasized that\nthese tools are also useful and accessible to the broader chemistry\nand chemical engineering communities. Two such resources have been developed with respect to solvent selection,\nnamely a solvent guide and a solvent\nselection tool. While the former provides\ntabulated information ranking solvents through evaluation of various\nproperties, the latter allows a more prospective approach to solvent\nselection/optimization through identification of suitable reaction\nmedia utilizing the desired properties to facilitate the process as\ninputs. While the properties of a solvent are key to making\nan informed\ndecision, there are other factors that need to be considered. Obviously,\nthe chemistry must work, and it is important that the solvent is also\ninert under the reaction conditions, while enabling the workup/isolation\nof the desired product can also streamline the process. Solvent recovery\nand potential for recycling should be considered, while safety and\npotential hazards to both health and the environment are critical.\nOverall cost not only to purchase the material but also to dispose\nof the waste stream in compliance with the relevant legislation must\nbe kept in mind. The term “green solvent” is widely\nemployed in the chemistry literature, and it is important to establish\ncriteria for a material to meet with this definition. Specifically, a material should be derived\nfrom a renewable feedstock and place low demands on the energy required\nto produce it. The solvent should also be biodegradable, insoluble\nin water, and have a midrange boiling point in that it is not too\nlow as to be considered a VOC and not too high in that it is difficult\nto recycle. Married to these characteristics should be the properties\nof materials that are considered to be “safe” solvents\nwith high stability, low flammability (high FP) and low to moderate\ntoxicity. Often during discussions regarding the development/utilization\nof solvents, the environmental impacts associated with the overall\nmanufacture of the materials are overlooked though they are a vital\npart of the complete picture. While a detailed discussion of this\nis beyond the scope of this perspective, it is, however, critical\nfor the scientist to have knowledge of the factors involved to allow\nfor both the judicious selection of current reaction solvents to be\nmade as well as a critical benchmarking of the processes reported\nto produce emerging “greener” reaction solvents. In\naddition, when considering aspects of worker safety, it is important\nalso to consider workers associated with the various manufacturing\nprocesses in addition to the end user. In many cases, the manufacturing\nprocesses for a solvent are energy-intensive and generate significant\ngreenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to climate change, with\nthis issue being exacerbated by the requisite transportation of solvents\nto various locations for use. As noted, many solvents are volatile\norganic compounds (VOCs) that vaporize quickly at room temperature\nand, during manufacture, can escape into the atmosphere. Reactions\noccur with other chemicals contributing to ground-level ozone, which\nis a component of smog. Not only does this contribute to air pollution\nbut also leads to impacts on health, such as causing respiratory issues\nand triggering asthma. Many manufacturing processes for solvents also\ngenerate wastewater that can often contain chemical pollutants, with\nstringent control measures required to prevent these entering waterways\nto contaminate aquatic ecosystems. With newer reaction media, much\nonus is placed on these being derived from renewable feedstocks as\nmost of the current solvents we utilize are derived from oil and gas,\nwhich are finite resources, though the overall proposed manufacture\nof a new solvent (or a conventional solvent from renewable feedstocks)\nhas to be considered as more hazardous processes may be involved if\na biobased feedstock is employed as the raw material. In addition, for a complete lifecycle analysis\nof a solvent to be derived, the extraction/processing of the raw materials\nalso needs to be considered. While developing\nnewer reaction media represents an aspirational long-term goal, one\nkey factor which should be implemented where viable to mitigate the\nenvironmental impact of a solvent is solvent recovery/recycling systems\nthat reduce waste and can save costs/resources through enabling reuse\nof a solvent. However, in discovery,\nimplementing such systems is often not viable owing to the scales\ninvolved, while in pharmaceutical industry development/manufacturing,\nthere are regulatory guidelines to comply with. As noted, there are numerous\nsolvent guides readily available, though they all represent variations\non a theme most notably in how the relevant information is presented.\nBehind each of these guides, though, three common themes emerge: worker\nsafety, process safety, and environmental and regulatory considerations.\nThese are then broken down into various subcategories, which can be\n“scored” for each of the solvents under consideration\nbased on the available data, with the range of scores across categories\nthen weighted according to the specific guide to provide an overall\ndesirability for each specific solvent (and class). Typically, the\nguides are presented in a manner that allows granular decisions to\nbe made based not only on the overall rankings of solvents but also\non differentiation in the three areas defined above. Within these,\nfor worker safety, carcinogenicity,\nmutagenicity, reprotoxicity, skin absorption/sensitization, and toxicity\nare typically considered, while for process safety, flammability,\npotential for high emissions (high vapor pressure), peroxide formation, static charge, and odor issues are considered.\nFinally, ecotoxicity, potential groundwater contamination, EHS regulatory restrictions, ozone depletion, photoreactivity, and compliance with all relevant\nlegislation are all part of an evaluation of environmental and regulatory\nconsiderations. A survey of the\nsolvent selection guides published shows there to be approximately\n67% agreement in terms of the classifications of the materials evaluated.\nWhile there is excellent agreement in terms of most solvents that\nare either recommended or highly hazardous, there are discrepancies\ndistinguishing between recommended/problematic or problematic/hazardous\nclassifications based on a different weighting of the criteria used\nin the assembly of discrete guides. The IMI-Chem21 project funded\nthrough the EFPIA (European Foundation of Pharmaceutical Industries\nand Associations) and the European Union comprised of a number of\ncompanies (including several pharmaceutical companies) and universities\nwith the overall remit to develop sustainable biological and chemical\nmethodologies both through supporting research as well as providing\ntraining packages. One of the components\nof the latter was the development of a common solvent selection guide\nto allow a preliminary assessment of a solvent’s desirability\nto be used for scale-up purposes in the fine chemical industry. This\nguide not only includes classical solvents, but also is extended to\nnewer solvents as well as highlighting bioderived solvents. Although the guide was assembled as part of\na collaborative effort, like in all such endeavors, there are potential\ngaps in the methodology used with suggestions that the health criteria\nshould be based on OEL (Occupational Exposure Limit) while the environmental scoring should include the CO2 synthesis impact/GWP (Global Warming Potential). However, it is stressed that the tool is intended\nfor a preliminary assessment, with further discussion encouraged in\nspecific cases to challenge the ranking. For the Chem21 solvent\nguide, the scoring (score in each category\nbetween 1 and 10) and ranking are determined as follows. The physical\ndata and GHS (globalized harmonized system) hazard statements are collected from the SDS, and the safety\nscore is calculated using the flash point, autoignition temperature,\nresistivity, ability to form peroxides, etc. This proves the easiest\nto establish as while the health score reflecting the occupational\nhazard would most ideally be linked to the OELs, these are only established\nfor the most common solvents, and in addition, these threshold limits\nare not unified. The health score is therefore linked to the most\nstringent H3xx statement, thus capturing the potential severity of\nthe hazard as well as the range of impact. To these scores, a modifier\nof “plus 1” is added if the boiling point is less than\n86 °C. For solvents with incomplete toxicological data, a default\nscore of 5 is assigned. The environmental scoring is still not complete\nbased on lack of data for some materials though it is based on boiling\npoint as well as the nature of the H4xx statement. For each solvent,\nthree scores (HS&E) are determined with the ranking determined\nby a combination of these. Solvents with one score >8 or two scores\n>7 are classified as “hazardous” (red), one score\n=\n7 or two scores between 4 and 6 are assigned “problematic”\n(yellow), while all other solvents are “recommended”\n(green). The version of the guide showing 53 common solvents\nis shown in Figure \n. As the ranking\nsystem does not distinguish between “hazardous” and\n“highly hazardous” solvents, several have been defined\nas the latter based on group discussion. With the methodology, 36\nsolvents present a clear ranking with an 81% concordance with that\nobtained from the survey of the other published solvent selection\nguides, though it should be noted that in some cases this tool underestimates\nboth the health and safety hazards presented by a specific solvent.\nIn the cases in which a clear ranking was not determined, the default\nappears to be close to that previously reported. Chem21 solvent selection\nguide. Reproduced from ref.  with permission from the\nRoyal Society of Chemistry. This methodology was also applied to a series of\nemerging solvents\nthat have been purported as “greener” replacements for\nclassical solvents. The data are presented in Figure \n, and while highlighting the value of some\nof these alternative reaction media, it also serves to focus on areas\nin which more information is needed regarding both their ecotoxicity\nand general toxicity profiles. For some as well, it is also key to\nensuring reaction compatibility prior to utilization. Chem21 solvent selection\nguide: Emerging “greener”\nsolvents. Reproduced from ref.  with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. “What would\nserve as a suitable replacement solvent” is a typical question\nthat arises during the optimization of a chemical reaction, and usually,\nthe obvious answer to this is to consider homologues of what the currently\nemployed solvent is. For example, we replaced methanol with ethanol.\nHowever, this analysis can be somewhat flawed as it offers the question\nas to not only whether ethanol is the best alternative but also whether\nmethanol was actually the best starting point. An alternative way\nto consider this is to find a way to define whether solvents are “similar”\nor “different” in behavior beyond simple chemical functionality\nand to search for the ideal solvent based on the needs of the reaction.\nWhile the solvent selection guides, we have considered aid in identifying\nsolvents, they are typically utilized for postselection comparison\nbetween the solvent options. While this is valuable, it should be\nconsidered that often making an objective decision can be compromised\nby several factors, notably, what solvents are readily in hand, what\ndid the chemist use last time for such a transformation, or the commercial\navailability of the solvent. With these factors in mind, the choice\nof solvent is restricted to a simple consideration of the chemistry\n(polarity, incompatible functionality, and temperature range). The ACS-GCIPR solvent selection tool reverses this philosophy and\nfocuses on the molecular properties as opposed to the solvents themselves\nand looks to see the properties that will either interfere with or\nfacilitate the proposed process with the ideal selection envisioned\nto work across the reaction, workup, and isolation steps. The tool\nfeatures 272 solvents including research, process, and next-generation\ngreen solvents with ∼100 options included for the user to filter/highlight\nto help identify the best for their given reaction. Included herein\nare a range of 30 physicochemical properties for each solvent including\nrudimentary experimental data like boiling/melting points, viscosity,\nor other safety markers like flash/ignition points, which can be combined\nwith properties that capture aspects of the solvent’s polarity,\npolarizability, and hydrogen-bonding ability, such as dielectric constants,\ndipole moments, or Hansen parameters to name a few. The filter tab\nalso allows the user to select or discard different functional groups\nin order to restrict the output to a given class of solvents. Other\ncategories that can be evaluated are impacts on health, environmental\neffects on air and water, life-cycle assessment, and ICH solvent information\n(Figure \n). What the\ntool intends to do is to enable the user to define the requirements\nof their application with a set of 272 solvents and then be dynamically\ninterrogated to provide a shortlist of hits meeting these parameters. ACS-GCIPR\nsolvent selection tool. The objectivity highlighted through the solvent\nselection tool\nrepresents the key differentiator in that during this phase of the\nworkflow leading to the identification of the shortlist, the specific\nidentities of the solvents are never explicitly revealed. This serves\nto not only remove any inherent biases but also facilitate the opportunity\nto identify less obvious solvents that may be potentially advantageous\nfor a specific application. At this juncture, it is instructive\nto learn how the tool works\nand to validate its performance given the body of knowledge that the\nscientific community has accumulated over time regarding classical\nsolvents. The first challenge is to break down each solvent into a\nseries of descriptors with many of these being identified, such as\nchemical functionality, molecular descriptors, physical properties,\nregulatory classification, legal controls, environmental impact, and\nhealth and safety performance with numerous subcategories present\nin many of these. In evaluating a solvent for a specific purpose,\nsome or all of these descriptors could be important in making the\nright decision, while it can be challenging making comparisons while\nbalancing the impact of a wide range of parameters. To achieve this\nand enable identifying “similar” and “different”\noptions, it is necessary to represent solvents at a level beyond the\nindividual molecular properties. For this purpose, using a multivariate\ntechnique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows many potentially\ncorrelated parameters to be reduced to a small number of descriptors. For the solvent data, PCA identified 5 principal\ncomponents, enabling a model to be generated to distribute the solvents\nin 5-dimensional space (PC1 through PC5). There have been various\nreports on utilizing PCA for the analysis of solvents though a facile\nmethod to understand this is that when considering how a solvent may\ninteract with a solute, there are several potential mechanisms that\nmay be at play, which may all depend to varying degrees of different\nproperties of the solvent molecule under consideration. Given this, PCA is an established method to\n“combine” and “weight” a series of experimental/computed\nproperties of a solvent into discrete parameters (PC1, PC2, etc.)\nto enable benchmarking/comparison studies of solvents to be carried\nout effectively using the selection tool. The default view in\nthe tool is the projection in the plane of\nthe most dominant descriptors (PC1, PC2), and initial validation of\nthe tool can be derived when one visualizes solvents with the same\nprimary functionality (homologues within the same series) across these\ntwo vectors with the outcome that they occur in very close proximity\nto each other on the plot. From a high-level perspective, PC1 is the\ndominant descriptor representing a global lipophilicity (hydrophobicity)-polarity\nscale, while PC2 captures the next most significant characteristics\nand provides a representation of the hydrogen-bonding ability of a\nsolvent. Subsequent PCs (PC3–PC5) account for progressively\nsmaller amounts of the total variance, signifying finer distinctions\nin a solvent’s properties (volume, 3D shape, surface area,\netc.). Within the analysis, it is important to bear in mind that a\nspecific property/molecular descriptor can be embedded into multiple\nPCs though with a variation in terms of its weighting/contribution\nto that global property. In addition to validation of the generated\nPCA map through observed clustering of a related chemical series of\nesters, correlation with observed chemical phenomena (keto-enol tautomerism, O- vs C-alkylation, rates of SNAr reactions, etc.) provides further authentication of the value\nof this approach. While it is intuitive to infer that those solvents\nin proximity on the map are similar, this may not be the case in all\ndimensions, demonstrating that solvents that at first inspection appear\nvery different (for example, in terms of functionality) may offer\nmore similarities than simple chemical functionality may suggest,\nthus highlighting the value of this approach (Figure \n). While the background to how the data are\ncompiled and validated is useful to know, many users can exploit the\ntool simply to provide a graphical view of the solvent shortlist. ACS-GCIPR\nsolvent selection tool: Comparing solvents through PCA\nanalysis. Figure \n illustrates\ntwo high-level scenarios in which the value of utilization of the\nsolvent selection tool might be realized. The first is a screening\nscenario in which a new reaction is being considered, and it is not\nclear what is required in terms of solvent properties for the application\n(Figure \na). The remit\nbeing screening already implies that there is only limited information\navailable to start a search, and as such the exercise is truly holistic.\nHerein identifying an initial hit is useful, and then applying appropriate\nfilters will provide a shortlist of possible alternatives to evaluate.\nGiven the nature of the exercise, avoiding aggressive application\nof the filters is beneficial. Furthermore, when the desired view has\nbeen generated, a selection of representative solvent candidates from\ndiscrete quadrants will provide a first-pass evaluation as to the\ndesirable property space for the solvent for the transformation under\ninvestigation. Utilization of the ACS-GCIPR solvent selection tool: (a)\nScreening\nfor new potential reaction solvents; (b) Solvent optimization/replacement. A second scenario is perhaps more clear-cut being\nan optimization\nin which an initial hit is known (perhaps identified through screening),\nthough replacement options are desired (Figure \nb). In this case, it is reasonable to expect\nthat proximal solvents to the initial hit on the PCA map will provide\nsome degree of “similar” behavior. With this, applying\nfilters to a localized subset should provide a reasonable starting\npoint, while expanding/reducing the scope of these criteria is possible\ndepending on the scope/goals of the optimization study. In this scenario,\nthe tool serves as an “idea generator” and evaluating\nacross the various components while filtering using the properties\noptions allows a user to generate a “shortlist” that\ncan then be experimentally evaluated through a further screening campaign.\nThe ease of use and speed of the tool allow this to be achieved in\na relatively expeditious manner. Often,\nthe selection of a solvent for a specific transformation is based\non legacy experience, and given this and the established nature of\norganic synthesis, we hypothesized that certain synthetic transformations\nare more likely to rely on hazardous or problematic solvents than\nothers. Given this, we sought to gain a more thorough understanding\non which reaction classes have placed a strong reliance on what we\nwould consider to be poor solvent selections. To achieve this, we\nrevisited the solvent usage habits across the Medicinal Chemistry\ncommunity by surveying what reaction media were used for the most\nrecurrent synthetic transformation classes as previously identified\nfrom the experimentals of J. Med. Chem. by Brown\nand Bostrom in 2016.\n,\n In addition to these fundamental\nreactions, the central role that heterocyclic systems play in medicinal\nchemistry is also taken into account with the analysis extended to\nevaluate “heterocyclic synthesis”, which provides data\non the solvents utilized for reactions employed in the formation of\n3, 4, 5, and 6-membered heteroatom-containing rings (N, O, and S). We conducted our SciFinder-n survey on these\ntransformations across a broader time frame (2000–2021) though\nonce again limiting the scope of our investigation to articles from J. Med. Chem. Each synthetic transformation was defined\nby a structural search with remarkably ∼70% of the total reactions\nundertaken coming from just six of the 20 classes (excluding “heterocycle\nsynthesis” from this analysis as this covers a broader range\nof reaction types) that were evaluated (Figure \n). Common transformations in medicinal chemistry\n(J. Med.\nChem. 2000–2021). A visual depiction of the solvent usage data is\ndisplayed in Figure \n in which the number\nof incidences of the use of undesirable solvents is expressed as a\npercentage of the total number of occurrences for each specific reaction\nclass. It can be noted in the analyses presented that in addition\nto granular metrics regarding the use of the unsustainable solvents\nhighlighted in this review, data on a subset of other “hazardous”\nsolvents are presented. Although this category features a range of\nsolvents that are employed on a more sporadic basis, it demonstrates\nthat benzene, pyridine, carbon tetrachloride (and other chlorinated solvents), di-iso-propyl ether\n,\n and HMPA have all been used as reaction media within\nmedicinal chemistry programs, and as with the featured unsustainable\nsolvents, replacing these materials in reactions of interest is strongly\nrecommended. Percentage uses of the solvents/reaction class. Overall, evaluating the data, it can clearly be\nseen that across\nall reaction classes the use of the problematic solvents DMF and DCM\nis prevalent, though despite this and the lesser use of solvents such\nas Et2O, DME, dioxane, DCE, and NMP, the latter group still\nsees significant use and throughout these applications, the potential\nreplacement with greener alternatives would be beneficial. In addition,\nthe data demonstrate that often a specific solvent is selected for\na discrete reaction class, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that solvent\nselection is often based on legacy experience. Examples of this observation\ninclude 1,4-dioxane for Suzuki–Miyaura (∼26%), Buchwald–Hartwig couplings (∼28%), and Boc protection/deprotections (∼11/13%); DME for Suzuki–Miyaura couplings (∼14%) and notably diethyl ether for the addition\nof organometallic reagents to electrophiles (∼17%) (e.g., Grignard\nreactions). Notably for these applications\ninvolving ethereal solvents, medicinal chemists are encouraged to\ntest more environmentally benign derivatives like 2-MeTHF and CPME (vide infra), which have been reported to perform in a comparative\nmanner to those historically used for these applications. Further analysis of these data showed\nthat among the 20 reaction\nclasses, two (amide formation and oxidation of alcohols) used unsustainable\nsolvents in ∼70% of the reported instances, while a further\ngroup of 9 transformations was performed in hazardous reaction solvents\nwith between 50% and 70% probability (Figure \n). In contrast, only 7 of the reaction classes\nwere performed in undesirable solvents less than 40% of the number\nof times that they were reported. Almost half of the ∼35k amine\nalkylations were reported in undesirable solvents with 33% using DMF.\nSimilarly, ester formation (∼15k hits) was also carried out\n∼50% of the time using undesirable solvents (DCM 31%, DMF 13%),\nwhich is somewhat surprising given that these could be avoided if\nenvironmentally benign reaction media such as alcoholic systems are\nused with an acid catalyst. The exponential growth of Pd-mediated\ncouplings over the past 20 years is highlighted by ∼29k examples\nof Suzuki–Miyaura couplings being reported in the journal with\nover half of these using hazardous solvents most notably those that\nare potential carcinogens (1,4-dioxane 26%; DME 14%).\n, Overall utilization of nonsustainable/hazardous solvents. While these data are interesting, it is perhaps\nmore instructive\nto focus on what solvent choices are made for the most popular reactions\ncurrently carried out within medicinal chemistry programs. The most\npopular is amide bond formation, which is reported on >63k occasions\nutilizing DCM or DMF in 28% or 36% respectively of those instances.\n,\n In contrast, the formation of heterocycles represents the second\nmost prevalent transformation (∼56k) using hazardous solvents\n∼32% of the time with either DCM or DMF being employed equally\nin almost two-thirds of these occurrences. Strategies commonly invoked\nfor SAR investigations involve employing reactions to efficiently\nforge carbon-heteroatom bonds around the periphery of a core bioactive\nscaffold. Several transformations allow for the robust formation of\nC–N bonds with broad substrate scope enabling their application\nin parallel library format to access collections of related molecules\nto expedite SAR studies. Specifically, from our data, C­(sp2)–N/O bond formation (most notably Buchwald-Hartwig couplings),\nnitrogen alkylation, and reductive amination are exemplified on ∼64k occasions with\n47% of these being carried out in solvents, which are “undesirable”.\nFor each of these transformations, one can easily identify research\nopportunities to develop replacements for dioxane (28%, C­(sp2-N/O bond formation), DMF (33%, nitrogen alkylation) and chlorinated\nmedia (29%, reductive amination) for these reactions. There are ∼39k reports of Boc deprotections,\nand the data from these highlight one of the challenges often faced\nwithin a Discovery Chemistry environment. Herein for convenience,\na commercial solution of HCl in 1,4-dioxane (4 M) is extensively utilized\nas the reagent, thus leading to ∼13% of the reactions being\ncarried out using this solvent (this is like the statement above regarding\nthe use of diethyl ether for Grignard reactions given that many of\nthese reagents are supplied commercially as solutions in this solvent). DCM is also extensively used for Boc deprotections\n(∼33% of the time, typically with TFA) while DMF is also often encountered (∼12%) in this\ntransformation. It is worth noting that all three of these solvents\n(DCM, dioxane, and DMF) are also regularly used in reactions to install\nthe Boc-protecting group. One further observation from the data is\nthat there is a significant disparity in the reaction data between\nthe number of instances in which a Boc-protecting group is installed\nas opposed to its removal, with the latter dominating by almost 10-fold.\nAt first glance, this would appear to be counterintuitive as one would\nexpect these reactions to be somewhat equivalent. However, discovery\nchemistry programs rely to a large degree on the commercial availability\nof orthogonally protected building blocks and monomers to elaborate\ncompounds to investigate chemical space. Given this within our programs,\nthe Boc-protected amine is often employed as a starting material,\nand thus, only the removal is carried out within our laboratories. From our survey, the six transformations described thus far account\nfor almost 70% of the reactions described with the remaining 14 reaction\nclasses accounting for the remainder. However, distinct trends emerge in the analysis of this subset of\ndata. Notably, the reduction of aromatic nitro groups to anilines\nappears to exhibit the most benign solvent profile with this typically\ncarried out in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, EtOAc, and THF\nin contrast to examples in more problematic reaction media (13%). Perhaps this is not surprising given that this\ntransformation is often carried out via hydrogenation with a heterogeneous\ncatalyst and the typical solvents used\npresent favorable properties in terms of both solubilizing the gas\nand facilitating the mass transfer between the three phases. While selecting a potential solvent for this\nreaction, one can prioritize using either an alcohol or EtOAc for\nthis transformation, specifically when the significant energy considerations\nassociated with the manufacture of THF are considered. This though\nis very much the exception with, for example, DMF being frequently\nused across phenol alkylation (35%), ester formation (13%), O-debenzylation\n(6%) and C­(sp2)–N/C­(sp2)–O bond\nformations (7%). As noted, the latter also frequently uses dioxane\n(28%), while another ethereal solvent DME is employed in ∼14%\nof Suzuki–Miyaura couplings. The analysis of this subset of\nreaction classes also highlights DCM as a “go-to” solvent\nfor numerous transformations including alcohol oxidations (54%, often\nin tandem with the Dess–Martin periodinane of related hypervalent-iodine-based\nreagents), sulfonamide synthesis (40%),\nester formation (31%) O- (20%), and N-debenzylations (15%). A rationale\npresented for the prevalent use of solvents such as DMF and DCM in\nmedicinal chemistry is often their ability to solubilize a broad range\nof organic molecules, though AI/ML-based\npredictive methods for compound solubility are emerging, which may\nprovide an opportunity to select more sustainable reaction media based\nspecifically on the substrate of interest. With these data in hand, one can immediately reach the conclusion\nthat significant impacts in terms of sustainability can be gained\nwithin a medicinal chemistry program simply by developing “greener”\nconditions specifically with the use of more environmentally benign\nsolvents for the transformation. To achieve this, the data were further\nrefined to highlight not only the most recurrent reaction classes\nbut also those that typically employ undesirable solvents. This led\nus to identify the following 12 transformations, which would benefit\nfrom greener reaction conditions with the numbers in parentheses representing\nan approximate “count” of the occasions that this reaction\nhas been performed in a hazardous solvent in the period under review.\nThese are amide formation (45k), Boc deprotection (26k), amine alkylation\n(18k), synthesis of heterocycles (18k), Suzuki–Miyaura coupling\n(16k), ester hydrolysis (9k), reductive amination (8k), sulfonamide\nsynthesis (8k), ester hydrolysis (8k), phenol alkylation (7k), C­(sp2)–N/C­(sp2)–O bond formations (4k),\nand oxidation of alcohols (4k). However, despite what might appear\nto be a somewhat bleak outlook, from our extensive literature review,\nfor all of these transformations noted here, there exist numerous\nexamples in which the reactions are conducted under more sustainable\nconditions. In the next section, a series of these have been collated\nfor each transformation in a readily accessible format, thus enabling\nthese to be investigated as potential “first-pass” conditions\nupon encountering a new substrate without the need for extensive literature\nresearch. There are several approaches that can be adopted to pursue greener\nconditions for a specific transformation under investigation. As highlighted,\nthe choice of solvent plays a major role in assessing the overall\nsustainability of the reaction not only through the relative volume\nof possible waste generated but also through its potentially undesirable\nproperties (toxicity, etc.). Considering this, the strategy of straight\nsubstitution of the solvent for a more sustainable medium presents\na logical path forward, and this can be greatly facilitated using\na solvent guide as previously discussed. This has successfully been\nimplemented and reported on several occasions for example, the replacement\nof DCM with 2-MeTHF for amide bond formations, switching DMF for more\nrecently developed polar aprotic solvents like cyrene or dimethyl isosorbide in SNAr reactions,\nand replacing ether with 2-MeTHF for Grignard chemistry. An extension\nof this approach is offered through the solvent selection tool, which\nenables the user to utilize the most desirable properties that the\nreaction medium should possess to mediate the transformation of interest\n(polarity, pKa etc.) and then apply these to identify\nsolvents that may be of value. With a specific transformation\nin mind, the ACS-GCIPR Reagents Guide presents an excellent resource\nin providing a starting point for conditions to explore for a given\nreaction. Currently this tool covers 29 transformations demonstrating\nfor each the possible reagents to be utilized in a simple Venn diagram\nformat, in which conditions are assigned based on criteria around\n“wide substrate scope”, “applicability to scale”,\nand “greenness”. Naturally those results found at the\nintersection of the three circles represent a “sweet spot”\nin terms of overall applicability and sustainability (Figure \n). However, within medicinal\nchemistry programs, the objective is often speed, and as such, conditions\nthat have been shown previously to have worked for a wide variety\nof examples are the most compelling, though these are often found\nto not be particularly attractive from a green perspective. Annotated\nACS-GCIPR reagent guide Venn diagram (alcohol oxidation). The strategies so far discussed focus on either\nthe choice of solvent\nor reagent selection for a specific transformation, which overlooks\nthe fact that these two discrete parameters are often critically interrelated.\nOn most occasions when a medicinal chemist is confronted with a new\nchemical series to work on, they will search a database (either a\ncommercial offering such as SciFinder or an institutional ELN: Electronic\nLab Notebook) for reactions that have been run on similar substrates\nto provide initial conditions to test. With this workflow, it is highly\nlikely to perpetuate chemically successful, albeit nonenvironmentally\nsustainable reaction conditions given that the methods previously\nutilized were largely developed in a time when the importance of sustainability\nwas not as widely recognized. Based on our extensive data mining\ndescribed for obtaining the\nsolvent usage information, herein we propose an alternative strategy\nfor the choice of initial reaction conditions to evaluate when faced\nwith a novel chemical series. Collected in Table \n, one will find a selection of at least three\ncurrent, more environmentally sustainable conditions for each of the\nten most common reaction types observed in JMC as previously discussed.\nThe proposed conditions are ordered from “more conservative”\nat the top to “further from precedent” at the bottom,\nand we suggest that these can be utilized in situations when a medicinal\nchemist is confronted with either a new substrate/chemical series\nor perhaps even better when trying to “green” a current\nreaction. Each reaction shows a specific substrate with the reaction\nconditions and the corresponding references, thus eliminating the\nneed for the chemist to look up alternate sources, and it is envisioned\nthat Table \n will serve\nas a valuable resource for “green” conditions for the\nabove (12) most common reaction types. To assist in both its uptake\nand overall utility, a poster version of this information has been\nmade available in the Supporting Information for use as a Quick Reference Guide. The overall approach suggested\nherein is unique in not only in marrying the reagents/solvents for\na specific transformation but also for the fact that in many cases\nthe selected examples have been performed on pharmaceutically relevant\nsubstrates, thus somewhat mitigating common concerns regarding substrate\nsolubility under a specific set of reaction conditions, which is often\na major challenge when a simple “solvent swap” is implemented\nto “green” a reaction.\n,,,− It\nhas been widely recognized throughout the industry that the major\ncontributors to the PMI of a chemical reaction are solvents and water,\nand while this is well established particularly in chemical development,\nmedicinal chemists often use large volumes of water and organic solvents\nparticularly in the extractive workup of chemical transformations. In fact, the elimination of such workups and\ntheir replacement with solvent swaps through distillation to telescope reaction steps represents a common strategy to drive down PMI numbers\nwithin chemical development. In order\nto assay the impact of solvent usage for workup and purification (vide infra) within the medicinal chemistry research phase,\na similar survey to that described previously was conducted of published J. Med. Chem. procedures between 2000 and 2021. To streamline\nthe analysis, a representative sampling of four publications was chosen\nfrom each year for a total of 80 publications over the 20-year span\nleading to 1874 experiments being reviewed. Of these experiments,\nit was shown that 53% utilized an extractive aqueous workup procedure\n(Figure \n).\n,\n In the remaining cases, an extractive workup is avoided either through\ndirect precipitation of solutes through addition of an antisolvent\nor through a simple evaporation to yield the crude product. In contrast to the range of solvents used for\nreactions, the options for extraction are more limited based on the\nrequirement for them to be essentially immiscible with water, and\nthose utilized in the reactions surveyed are collected in Figure \n. Pleasingly from\na sustainability perspective, over half of the analyzed reactions\nused EtOAc (54%) as the solvent for extraction. However, 31% of the reactions utilized hazardous chlorinated\nsolvents, while 7% used extremely flammable diethyl ether, which is\nalso prone to peroxide formation. The survey also clearly reveals\nthat there has been little to no uptake in medicinal chemistry settings\nof newly emerging solvents such as MTBE, CPME, and 2-MeTHF for extractions. While these solvents can serve as greener and\nsafer alternatives to diethyl ether (the flashpoint of diethyl ether\nis −40 °C, while that of 2-MeTHF is −12 °C),\n2-MeTHF also presents an alternative to dichloromethane, which as\nnoted has both health and environmental concerns. From a practical\nperspective, 2-MeTHF (unlike THF) is immiscible with water and can\nthus be used to extract products directly from reaction mixtures without\nthe formation of emulsions, which is often a challenge with dichloromethane.\nOne of the drivers often presented for the use of chlorinated solvents\nfor extraction within medicinal chemistry is that the desired products\nare often highly polar and water-soluble, and as such diethyl ether\nand EtOAc are ineffective as extraction solvents. Recent work by Reetz and coworkers has identified n-butanol as an ecologically\nviable choice for such systems with this solvent proving to be particularly\neffective for the extraction of polar compounds from enzymatic processes. Furthermore, simply through reducing both the\nnumber of extractions employed during an aqueous workup and the volume\nof solvents utilized during the process can greatly reduce the overall\nPMI value of the transformation leading to a more sustainable outcome. Analysis of (a) methods of purification and\n(b) extractive workups\nin medicinal chemistry procedures. Solvents used in extractive workups (right schematic combines\nnonsustainable\nsolvents: see Table \n). In addition to workup conditions, the experimental\nprocedures were\nalso probed to assay the trends in the purification methods of choice\nwithin a medicinal chemistry setting. Of the 1874 reactions surveyed,\nca. 90% utilized a purification method of some kind (Figure \n), while the survey indicated\nthat in contrast to chemical development, telescoping reactions are\nnot regularly exploited in research settings with only 187 instances\nof this being encountered. It is self-evident that telescoping of\nreactions can lead to a reduction in solvent usage (reaction, workup,\nand purification) as well as potentially time and energy savings.\nIn contrast to development chemistry, telescoping represented only\n∼10% of this data set though this is probably not too surprising\nbased on the primary focus of the articles being the syntheses of\nmultiple discrete compounds for biological assays. The predominant\nmethod of purification (>50% of cases) was normal-phase chromatography\nusing a solid support, which in most cases is silica.\n,\n This group has previously published on concepts around “sustainability\nchromatography” providing not only a roadmap of potential alternatives\nto avoid chromatography but also suggested “greener”\nreplacements to commonly used mobile phases. The popularity of this method of purification has no doubt been\nmaintained through the ease of accessibility of simple to use, automated\nsystems that are prevalent throughout medicinal chemistry laboratories. The survey indicated that the predominant nonpolar\neluant in normal-phase chromatography was hexane, though from a Green\nChemistry perspective, this solvent should be replaced with cyclohexane\nor more preferably heptane (Figure \na). These latter solvents are significantly less toxic\nand thus have higher occupational exposure limits than hexane. The\nlower volatility of heptane compared to both hexane and pentane also\nleads to lower emissions and decreased environmental impact while\nalso representing less of a fire hazard. From a practical standpoint,\nthe higher boiling point of heptane often allows compounds to be precipitated\ndirectly upon evaporation of heptane/EtOAc mixtures. The survey also\nindicates that dichloromethane, most commonly in combination with\nmethanol, remains a common solvent utilized in medicinal chemistry\nsettings for chromatography. This is even though practical, straightforward,\nand more environmentally responsible alternatives to this toxic solvent\nhave been evaluated and proven to be effective. In particular, the\nsurvey indicated little uptake of a 3:1 mixture of EtOAc/ethanol (polar\neluent) and heptane (nonpolar eluent) as a recommended substitution\nfor dichloromethane even though the EtOAc/EtOH blend is now commercially\navailable and a much greener solvent alternative to dichloromethane/methanol\nmixtures. HPLC was also found to be\na common technique for product purification in medicinal chemistry\nlaboratories though evaporation/lyophilization of aqueous mixtures\ncan be relatively energy intensive.\n,\n SFC is often\npromoted as a “greener” method for product purification\n,\n though the survey revealed that this is rarely utilized probably\nowing to the nature of this technique (requiring high-pressure CO2 supply) thus restricting it to specialist purification laboratories.\n,\n The ACS-GCIPR have recently developed an Analytical Method Greenness\nScore (AMGS) tool, which can be utilized to benchmark and compare\ndirectly analytical methods. The AMGS\nmetric factors in both the impact of the solvent (health, safety,\nenvironmental, and waste), the energy demands of the instrumentation\nas well as the overall technique and highlights the sustainability\nbenefits that can be gained in selecting more modernized methods and\ntechniques without compromising separation performance.\n, Analysis of solvents used in (a) chromatography and (b) alternative\nworkups/purification methods. Impact of miniaturization on the reaction number/scale/solvent\nuse. Adapted from ref.  with permission from Elsevier. Within medicinal chemistry, access to milligram quantities of bioactive\ncompounds often suffices for initial profiling in relation to target\nbiology and metabolic stability, and as such the scale on which one\noperates becomes a critical consideration in minimizing waste. A successful discovery campaign will iteratively\nimprove on advanced compounds through a well-established “design,\nmake, test, analyze” cycle with\nspeed of execution being a critical factor leading to a heavy reliance\non parallel synthesis and reversed-phase/accelerated\napproaches to purification to drive\ndecision making. This oft-unstated emphasis on proceeding in an expeditious\nfashion can lead to a prioritization of compound numbers (diversity)\nat the expense of poor synthetic chemistry and thus sustainability. Miniaturization provides a complementary\nstrategy to solvent replacement in minimizing/reducing the pharmaceutical\nindustry’s footprint on global sustainability. Miniaturization and High Throughput Experimentation\n(HTE) are inseparable technologies, which have advanced in their ability\nto solve chemistry problems over the past 20 years. In one manifestation, HTE involves performing multiple\nchemical reactions in parallel, whether for the purpose of parallel\nevaluation of multiple conditions (one reaction, many sets of conditions)\nor for parallel synthesis (multiple reacting partners typically under\na common set of conditions). In comparison to reactions conducted\neither in dram vials or round-bottom flasks, decreasing the vessel\nsize to 8 × 30 mm (100 μL) or even 4 × 21 mm (25 μL)\nutilizes significantly reduced solvent volumes (Figure \n). Alternatively, reactions\ncan also be conducted in a 96-well (or 384/1536) plate format though solvent compatibility with plastics\n(e.g., polystyrene) needs to be taken into consideration. With advances in technologies such as analytical\ntechniques, tumble-stirring, inertion chambers, aluminum heating blocks, LED plates, biocatalysis, innovative approaches\nto reagent dosing, and parallel electrochemical\ndesigns, the majority of synthetic organic\nreactions can now be performed on a microscale (which we will define\nas ≤1 mg of substrate per reaction). Hypothetically, an array of 40 microscale reactions consumes the\nsame quantity of substrate (and solvent) as a single reaction at a\n1 mL scale (Figure \n). Potential impact of investment in HTE\non parallel medicinal chemistry. Uptake of both miniaturization and HTE can have\nprofound impacts\non sustainability and Green Chemistry goals, as demonstrated specifically\nthrough the following activities. Rapid Optimization Increases the Probability\nof Success for Parallel Synthesis\n – consider running an array of compounds under suboptimal\nconditions in which only 20% of reactions lead to the desired product.\nFor example, if there are 24 reactions (1 mL solvent each), with a\n20% success rate, only 5 analogs will be successfully obtained. Furthermore,\none strategy that is often adopted for poor-performing reactions is\nto increase the scale to ensure that “some” product\nis obtained leading to additional solvent use as well as potentially\nlaborious purification sequences. If, for example, a quick optimization\nis carried out using preplated catalysts, and the success rate were to be enhanced to 80%, 19 analogs will\nbe registered. To illustrate this as an estimate, Scenario A translates\nto 100 mL of solvent and uses 3.24 g of advanced intermediate (or\ntemplate), whereas Scenario B requires only ∼25 mL of solvent\nwhile now using 984 mg of compound. Further benefits are also realized\nwith reduced cycle time as well as reductions\nin waste generated owing to less starting template being used (e.g.,\ndiscarded nitrile gloves, test tubes, syringes, purification solvents,\nreaction workup waste) (Figure \n).\nLess is More.\nPushing the Boundary to Nanoscale\nSynthesis – there has long been a disconnect within\nmedicinal chemistry between the amount of compound synthesized compared\nto the amount of material needed for an initial biochemical assay,\nthough with additional recent advances, conducting reactions on vanishingly\nsmall quantities (0.05 mg) has become possible. To this end utilizing automated liquid-handling techniques\ncapable of dispensing droplet quantities, chemists are now able to\nconduct analog syntheses in a 1536-well-plate format either with or\nwithout purification allowing a rapid and systematic evaluation of\nchemical space while minimizing solvent use (conducting 1536 reactions\neach in 1.2 μL of solvent uses less than 2 mL in total). This\nrepresents a seismic shift in the volumes of solvents utilized during\nan SAR campaign if the chemistries for each discrete analog are performed\non a nanoscale. A robust partnership and coordination between analytical\ncharacterization and biological assay\ndevelopment is critical for success with this approach.\n\nScreen\nto be Green – the application\nof material-sparing approaches to HTE within medicinal chemistry programs\nenables the rapid evaluation to identify potentially greener reaction\nconditions for a specific transformation of interest. For example,\nthe legacy data from J. Med. Chem. suggest that amide-bond\nformation is best conducted in either DMF or DCM as the reaction solvent.\nUtilizing a 96-well plate format allows the experimentalist to assay\nthe viability of this reaction in a range of other solvents in a highly\nexpeditious manner.

In addition, vast quantities of data are generated during\nsuch endeavors, and through the application of cheminformatics tools\ncoupled with the advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence,\nthe Green Principle of “Prevention” can be realized. We have already seen how HTE can reduce the\nneed to repeat experiments through investing upfront, while in combinatorial\ndesigns, the use of predicted properties to enhance the “drug-likeness”\nof designs means selecting compounds with a higher probability of\nprogressing through a project testing cascade thus eliminating the unnecessary synthesis of compounds\nwith undesirable properties. Rapid Optimization Increases the Probability\nof Success for Parallel Synthesis\n – consider running an array of compounds under suboptimal\nconditions in which only 20% of reactions lead to the desired product.\nFor example, if there are 24 reactions (1 mL solvent each), with a\n20% success rate, only 5 analogs will be successfully obtained. Furthermore,\none strategy that is often adopted for poor-performing reactions is\nto increase the scale to ensure that “some” product\nis obtained leading to additional solvent use as well as potentially\nlaborious purification sequences. If, for example, a quick optimization\nis carried out using preplated catalysts, and the success rate were to be enhanced to 80%, 19 analogs will\nbe registered. To illustrate this as an estimate, Scenario A translates\nto 100 mL of solvent and uses 3.24 g of advanced intermediate (or\ntemplate), whereas Scenario B requires only ∼25 mL of solvent\nwhile now using 984 mg of compound. Further benefits are also realized\nwith reduced cycle time as well as reductions\nin waste generated owing to less starting template being used (e.g.,\ndiscarded nitrile gloves, test tubes, syringes, purification solvents,\nreaction workup waste) (Figure \n). Less is More.\nPushing the Boundary to Nanoscale\nSynthesis – there has long been a disconnect within\nmedicinal chemistry between the amount of compound synthesized compared\nto the amount of material needed for an initial biochemical assay,\nthough with additional recent advances, conducting reactions on vanishingly\nsmall quantities (0.05 mg) has become possible. To this end utilizing automated liquid-handling techniques\ncapable of dispensing droplet quantities, chemists are now able to\nconduct analog syntheses in a 1536-well-plate format either with or\nwithout purification allowing a rapid and systematic evaluation of\nchemical space while minimizing solvent use (conducting 1536 reactions\neach in 1.2 μL of solvent uses less than 2 mL in total). This\nrepresents a seismic shift in the volumes of solvents utilized during\nan SAR campaign if the chemistries for each discrete analog are performed\non a nanoscale. A robust partnership and coordination between analytical\ncharacterization and biological assay\ndevelopment is critical for success with this approach. Screen\nto be Green – the application\nof material-sparing approaches to HTE within medicinal chemistry programs\nenables the rapid evaluation to identify potentially greener reaction\nconditions for a specific transformation of interest. For example,\nthe legacy data from J. Med. Chem. suggest that amide-bond\nformation is best conducted in either DMF or DCM as the reaction solvent.\nUtilizing a 96-well plate format allows the experimentalist to assay\nthe viability of this reaction in a range of other solvents in a highly\nexpeditious manner. Furthermore, an HTE-based approach to reaction\ndevelopment allows secondary- and ternary-interactions between reactants/catalysts/additives\nand solvents to be easily detected, thus leading to a more robust\nunderstanding of a reaction mechanism.

To summarize, miniaturization and HTE offer an orthogonal\napproach\nto reducing solvent usage and therefore contribute to the overall\nsustainability of our industry. And while these tools provide medicinal\nchemists with many opportunities to increase efficiencies while reducing\nwaste, an existing challenge most notably for HTE is with relation\nto waste consumables (plastic plates/glass vials), where application\nof the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle could further supplement\nprogress toward sustainable discovery chemistry.\n\n## Solvent Hazards\nThere are numerous sources of information\navailable that provide researchers with details regarding the safety\nand hazards inherent to a specific solvent/substance that is being\nused. Perhaps most valuable is the MSDS\n(Material Safety Data Sheet, sometimes referred to as an SDS that\ncontains the same information) that is supplied with all materials\nand can be easily accessed from a vendor’s Web site. The MSDS is defined as a document that provides\nworkers with procedures for safely handling or working with a particular\nsubstance (Figure \n). Many companies will also retain an internal repository/database\nof these as part of their Health and Safety groups. While variations\noccur in the appearance of the MSDS based on the source, these documents\nare typically templated and consist of 16 sections with sections 1\nand 2 dealing with the identification of the substance (and the supplier)\nand a high-level description of the hazards, respectively. Section\n3 describes the specification of the ingredients, while measures addressing\nFirst Aid, Firefighting, and Accidental Release are the topics for\nsections 4 through 6. Section 7 talks of the handling and storage\nof the material, while section 8 focuses on the exposure controls\nand necessary personal protection for working with the substance in\nquestion. Sections 9 and 10 report the physical/chemical properties\nand the stability/reactivity characteristics of the material in question,\nwhile sections 11 and 12 provide information on toxicological and\necological studies. Sections 13 and 14 provide guidance for the disposal\nand transportation of the chemical substance, with section 15 addressing\ninformation regarding regulatory listings. Section 16 is provided\nto disclose any relevant information that has not been captured elsewhere\nin the document. Representative MSDS with the section descriptors. Table \n summarizes\nsome of the properties of these solvents that we will provide an overview\nof in this section. Based on space constraints, this is obviously\nnot a complete list nor is the following discussion an exhaustive\noverview as detailed reports of numerous reports on physical properties,\nreactivity, and ecological and toxicological profiles of each solvent\nexist in the primary literature. The table includes thermal characteristics such as\nboiling point,\nflash point, and autoignition temperature. The latter two are often\nconfused, the flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature\nat which its vapors will ignite if given an ignition source, while\nthe autoignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a\nsubstance will spontaneously ignite in a normal atmosphere without\na source of ignition. The NFPA rating system (NFPA 704) provides a\nsimple visual representation mainly intended for emergency personnel\ndealing with a fire or spill to indicate the health (blue), flammability\n(red), reactivity (yellow) and special (white) hazards associated\nwith a specific material. Different colored\nsectors are employed to represent the distinct hazards with a number\nrating system of 0–4 (0 representing the least and 4 representing\nthe greatest risk) utilized to rate each of these on the diamond displayed\non the container of the substance. Figure \n provides an overview of the criteria applied\nto assign ratings to materials for each hazard. NFPA rating system. Other labeling systems (HMIS, OSHA HazCom) are\nalso often used\nthough they are not discussed here. The\nexplosive limits for a solvent specify the concentration range of\na material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an\nignition source and are usually expressed as the percent volume of\nthe material in the air. The Lower Explosive\nLimit (LEL) is the lowest concentration of vapor that will burn in\nair and for most flammable gases, it is less than 5% by volume, while\nthe Upper (or higher) Explosive Limit (UEL) is the highest concentration\nof a vapor above which a flame will not spread in the presence of\nan ignition source. It is important to note that percentages higher\nthan the UEL are considered to be “too rich to burn”. The LC50 and LD50 data tabulated provide\na relative assessment to the toxicity of a specific solvent and should\nbe considered in context. Specifically,\ntoxicity is divided into multiple categories based on the duration\nof exposure. Acute toxicity is typically\nassociated with a single exposure over a relatively short time, while\nchronic toxicity addresses repeated or long-term exposure that occurs\nover months to years. LD50 is used to describe acute toxicity and is the median lethal oral\n(or dermal) dose predicted to cause death in 50% of the test animals. The values are expressed in milligrams of compound\nper kilogram of body weight of the test species (mg/kg). While LD50 is the lethal dose, LC50 refers to the lethal\nconcentration and is utilized for inhalation-based studies (the values\nfor the latter can be reported in mg/L, mg/m3, or ppm). Comparisons are often challenging, as it is\nimportant to remember that estimates of the LD50 are specific\nto the test animals used in the study and variability is observed\nnot only between species but also between different studies. As a guideline, compounds with an oral LD50 of 0–50 mg/kg are considered highly toxic, while\nan LD50 of >2000 mg/kg is associated with a material\nof\nlow toxicity. Various assessments such as the Hodge/Sterner or Gosselin/Smith/Hodge\nscales can be used to compare and provide a more granular description\nof LD50 values, and extensive\ndatabases are available typically through subscription such as the\nRegistry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS). Even though the hazards presented by several\nsolvents are well\nunderstood, there are several that still find widespread use and for\nsome reactions/tasks represent the preferred choice in Medicinal Chemistry\nsynthesis programs despite their unsustainable nature (Figure \n). These solvents come from specific solvent classes, namely hydrocarbon, chlorinated, ethereal,\nand dipolar aprotic solvents with several\nrecent reviews providing a broad overview of their applications in\nsynthetic chemistry. A brief overview of each of the solvents is provided\nin the following sections with more detailed information around the\nhazards of these materials discussed in the Supporting Information. Nonsustainable solvents commonly used in medicinal chemistry.\n\n## Hydrocarbon (Alkane) Solvents\nn-Hexane is a very volatile\naliphatic hydrocarbon that is insoluble in water and is commonly used\nas a solvent in medicinal chemistry laboratories most notably in chromatographic\nseparations. Caution must be exercised,\nas flammable vapors from this solvent may dissipate away from a spill\nand represent an explosion hazard. The odor threshold for hexane is\n130 ppm with the solvent reported to have a “faint, peculiar”\nodor. Various grades of hexane(s) are\navailable with the laboratory solvent n-hexane containing\napproximately 99% n-hexane, while “hexane”\nor “hexanes” is a commercial and industrial product\nconsisting of a mixture of n-hexane and its isomers\n2-methyl- and 3-methyl-pentane along with a small number of other\nhydrocarbons. 1,4-Dioxane is a colorless liquid that is commonly\nused as a solvent in medicinal chemistry laboratories most notably\nas a reaction solvent. It is completely\nmiscible with water and, in fact hygroscopic. The NFPA instability\nrating for this solvent is primarily based on its propensity for the\nformation of explosive peroxides, and robust, stringent testing criteria\n(date of opening, periodic testing, and prompt, appropriate disposal\nscheduled) should be established to ensure these do not become an\nissue. Crystals observed in the liquid\npotentially suggest that peroxidation has already occurred, and the\nproduct should be considered to be extremely dangerous. Then, and\nif peroxide formation is suspected, the container should not be opened\nor moved. With respect to flammable vapors,\nthese may dissipate away from a spill and may represent an explosion\nhazard. The odor threshold for 1,4-dioxane is 12 ppm with the solvent\nreported to have a “mild faint-sweet ether-like” odor.\n1,4-Dioxane is regulated by OSHA and is on the Special Health Hazard\nSubstance List because it is a carcinogen and is flammable. 1,2-Dimethoxyethane (DME) is a\ncolorless liquid with a sharp odor (no information available on the\nodor threshold) resembling petroleum distillates that finds used in\nresearch laboratories as a higher boiling alternative to both diethyl\nether and THF. It is often referred to\nby a variety of other names such as glyme, monoglyme, dimethyl glycol,\nethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and dimethyl cellosolve, and finds\nmore extensive use as the low-viscosity component of the solvent for\nelectrolytes of lithium batteries. It\nis completely miscible with water and has found applications as an\nalternative solvent for Grignard reactions as well as being used for\na functional solvent to provide homogeneous conditions for Pd-mediated\ncross-coupling reactions. Containers\nof DME may explode when heated, with vapors forming potentially explosive\nmixtures with air with the possibility of the vapors originating from\nthe source of ignition and causing flashback. As with many ether-based\nsolvents, explosive peroxide formation represents a significant concern,\nparticularly when the material is distilled, evaporated, or otherwise\nconcentrated. As noted previously, robust, stringent testing criteria\n(date of opening and periodic testing) should be established to ensure\nthat this does not become an issue. Diethyl ether is a colorless liquid that\nis for practical purposes immiscible with water (solubility 6.05 g/100\nmL at 25 °C), and possesses a pungent, sweetish, aromatic-like\nodor with a reported odor threshold of 0.83 ppm in air. While commonly used as a solvent in research\nlaboratories perhaps most notably as a solvent to facilitate crystallizations/extractions\nor solvent for organometallic reactions, diethyl ether is probably\nmore generally known as being extensively used as a general anesthetic. However, owing to its high flammability making\nthe solvent incompatible with modern surgical techniques as well as\nreports of abnormal liver function tests from patients anesthetized\nusing diethyl ether, its use in the medical setting is now obsolete. The flammability is widely cited as the major\nhazard associated with this solvent, and the compound is on the Special\nHealth Hazard Substance List due to this. Containers may explode when\nheated, with vapors forming potentially explosive mixtures with air\nwith the possibility of the vapors originating to the source of ignition\nand causing flashback. Again, the formation of explosive peroxides\nover time represents a significant concern, and containers should\nbe dated upon opening and tested periodically for the presence of\nperoxides.\n\n## Hexane\nn-Hexane is a very volatile\naliphatic hydrocarbon that is insoluble in water and is commonly used\nas a solvent in medicinal chemistry laboratories most notably in chromatographic\nseparations.

Again, the formation of explosive peroxides\nover time represents a significant concern, and containers should\nbe dated upon opening and tested periodically for the presence of\nperoxides.\n\n## MTBE (Methyl-\nMethyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE or sometimes TBME) is on the Hazardous\nSubstance List as it is cited in by ACGIH, DOT, DEP, IARC, IRIS, and\nEPA, and it is also on the Special Health Hazard Substance List because\nof its flammability. It is reported to\nsmell like turpentine (like petroleum distillates) with other descriptors\nof its odor being “bitter”, “fruity”,\nor akin to a “cleaning-agent”. The odor threshold is\nreported to be between 0.09 and 0.13 ppm though such values tend to\nbe somewhat broad and as such smell alone should not be relied upon\nto determine potential exposure. MTBE\nis used as an octane booster in gasoline, as well as a solvent in chemical manufacture and in medicine to\nfacilitate the dissolution of gallstones. In research laboratories, MTBE is promoted as a safer alternative\nto diethyl ether and is used for many of the same purposes (such as\nreactions and to facilitate precipitations). Specific advantages to support this include a higher boiling point,\nreduced water solubility, and a lesser tendency for the formation\nof peroxides. It is flammable, and containers\nmay explode upon heating with the vapors having the potential to form\nexplosive mixtures with air. In addition, vapors may travel back to\na source of ignition, leading to flashback.\n\n## Chlorinated Solvents\nDichloromethane (methylene chloride,\nDCM) is on the Right to Know Hazardous Substance List owing to being\ncited by the full gamut of regulatory agencies (OSHA, EPA, ACGIH,\nDOT, NIOSH, NTP, NFPA, IARC, and DEP), as well as on the Special Health\nHazard Substance List. The compound is\na colorless, volatile liquid with a sweet smell with the odor threshold\ncited between 25 to 150 ppm (note: odor thresholds vary widely and\nshould not be relied on solely in determining potentially hazardous\nexposures). Regarding exposure, dichloromethane\nmay be a carcinogen in humans, and as such there is no considered\nsafe level of exposure and all contact should be reduced to the lowest\npossible level. Despite this, the solvent\nwas widely used in paint and varnish removal products and is still employed in research laboratories as a reaction\nmedium, extensively for liquid/liquid\nextractions (dichloromethane is immiscible with water) and for chromatographic\nseparations. Dichloromethane has no flash\npoint under conventional conditions though it is flammable (flash\npoint −7 °C) when exposed to O2 gas. Dichloromethane can also form flammable vapor-air\nmixtures above 100 °C and has an autoignition temperature of\n556 °C. Although dichloromethane may burn, it does not readily\nignite though poisonous gases including hydrogen chloride and phosgene\nare produced in a fire. Similarly, to dichloromethane, chloroform\nis listed on both the Right to Know Hazardous Substance List and the\nSpecial Health Hazard Substance List. Chloroform is a colorless liquid\nreported to have a pleasant, sweet smell, with an odor threshold between\n2.4 and 85 ppm, though as noted odor thresholds vary greatly and odor\nshould not be solely relied upon to determine potentially hazardous\nexposures. Chloroform is a probable carcinogen\nin humans, and as such, there are no safe levels of exposure, and\nall contact should be reduced to the minimum possible level. Chloroform is used as a solvent and in the manufacture\nof refrigerants, resins, and plastics. As a laboratory solvent specifically both in liquid/liquid extractions\nand chromatography with dichloromethane (see above) is suggested as\na suitable replacement for chloroform though the higher boiling point\nof the latter still leads to its use in some thermally mediated reactions,\nwhile the deuterated version is widely used as an NMR solvent. Historically, chloroform was widely employed\nas an anesthetic since the 1850s, though this practice stopped after\nca. 100 years owing to both the complications encountered in controlled\nadministration of an effective dose as well as the development of\nsafer alternatives. Chloroform has a\nboiling point of 61 °C, with no flash point (caution should be\nexercised herein as chloroform often contains ethanol, which is volatile\nand flammable, as a stabilizer) or autoignition temperature. No explosive\nlimits are reported for chloroform though explosions of sealed containers\nhave occurred through reactions with acetone and/or strong bases. In a fire, it should also be noted that chloroform\ncan lead to the production of poisonous gases. While 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) may\nbe a carcinogen and, as such, is listed on the Right to Know Hazardous\nSubstance as well as the Special Health Hazard Substance Lists, unlike\nDCM and chloroform, DCE is also a flammable solvent. DCE is a colorless\nliquid reported to have a pleasant smell with an odor threshold of\nbetween 88 and 400 ppm, though due to variances herein, this should\nnot alone be used to determine hazardous exposures. As a possible carcinogen, there are no safe levels of exposure\nand therefore all contact should be reduced to as low a level as possible. In addition to its use as a laboratory solvent,\nDCE is widely used to make vinyl chloride and is a key step in the manufacture of PVC and was historically\nused as an antiknock additive in gasoline. DCE has a boiling point of 83 °C thus representing a higher\nboiling option to both the previously discussed chlorinated solvents,\nand forms azeotropes with many other solvents including water (at\na boiling point of 71 °C) despite being immiscible with the latter. The utility of DCE though as a solvent can to\nsome degree be limited by its potential reactivity with functional\ngroups such as amines. Containers of\nDCE even when empty should be kept away from heat and sources of ignition,\nand vapors can form explosive mixtures in air and travel back to a\nsource of ignition and flashback. Thermal decomposition can lead to\nthe release of toxic and irritating gases and vapors including CO,\nCO2, hydrogen chloride, and phosgene.\n\n## Dichloromethane\nDichloromethane (methylene chloride,\nDCM) is on the Right to Know Hazardous Substance List owing to being\ncited by the full gamut of regulatory agencies (OSHA, EPA, ACGIH,\nDOT, NIOSH, NTP, NFPA, IARC, and DEP), as well as on the Special Health\nHazard Substance List. The compound is\na colorless, volatile liquid with a sweet smell with the odor threshold\ncited between 25 to 150 ppm (note: odor thresholds vary widely and\nshould not be relied on solely in determining potentially hazardous\nexposures).

Chloroform is a probable carcinogen\nin humans, and as such, there are no safe levels of exposure, and\nall contact should be reduced to the minimum possible level. Chloroform is used as a solvent and in the manufacture\nof refrigerants, resins, and plastics. As a laboratory solvent specifically both in liquid/liquid extractions\nand chromatography with dichloromethane (see above) is suggested as\na suitable replacement for chloroform though the higher boiling point\nof the latter still leads to its use in some thermally mediated reactions,\nwhile the deuterated version is widely used as an NMR solvent. Historically, chloroform was widely employed\nas an anesthetic since the 1850s, though this practice stopped after\nca. 100 years owing to both the complications encountered in controlled\nadministration of an effective dose as well as the development of\nsafer alternatives. Chloroform has a\nboiling point of 61 °C, with no flash point (caution should be\nexercised herein as chloroform often contains ethanol, which is volatile\nand flammable, as a stabilizer) or autoignition temperature. No explosive\nlimits are reported for chloroform though explosions of sealed containers\nhave occurred through reactions with acetone and/or strong bases. In a fire, it should also be noted that chloroform\ncan lead to the production of poisonous gases.\n\n## 1,2-Dichloroethane\nWhile 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) may\nbe a carcinogen and, as such, is listed on the Right to Know Hazardous\nSubstance as well as the Special Health Hazard Substance Lists, unlike\nDCM and chloroform, DCE is also a flammable solvent. DCE is a colorless\nliquid reported to have a pleasant smell with an odor threshold of\nbetween 88 and 400 ppm, though due to variances herein, this should\nnot alone be used to determine hazardous exposures. As a possible carcinogen, there are no safe levels of exposure\nand therefore all contact should be reduced to as low a level as possible. In addition to its use as a laboratory solvent,\nDCE is widely used to make vinyl chloride and is a key step in the manufacture of PVC and was historically\nused as an antiknock additive in gasoline. DCE has a boiling point of 83 °C thus representing a higher\nboiling option to both the previously discussed chlorinated solvents,\nand forms azeotropes with many other solvents including water (at\na boiling point of 71 °C) despite being immiscible with the latter. The utility of DCE though as a solvent can to\nsome degree be limited by its potential reactivity with functional\ngroups such as amines. Containers of\nDCE even when empty should be kept away from heat and sources of ignition,\nand vapors can form explosive mixtures in air and travel back to a\nsource of ignition and flashback. Thermal decomposition can lead to\nthe release of toxic and irritating gases and vapors including CO,\nCO2, hydrogen chloride, and phosgene.\n\n## Dipolar Aprotic Solvents\nDMF is included on the candidate list for REACH (Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation)\nwithin the EU (ECHA – European Chemical Agency) as a substance\nof very high concern (SVHC) owing primarily to acute toxicity and\nits reported propensity to lead to adverse reproductive and developmental\neffects. In addition, it is on the Right\nto Know Hazardous Substance List, owing to citations from a broad\nrange of regulatory organizations. DMF is a colorless (though sometimes\nslightly yellow) liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water.\nIt is reported to have a fishy, unpleasant (ammonia-like) odor with\nan odor threshold of 2.2 ppm (estimates of this have varied between\n0.47 and 100 ppm again demonstrating how odor thresholds can vary\ngreatly and given this odor alone should not be taken to determine\npotential exposure). DMF is widely used\nas an industrial solvent to produce polymer fibers, films, and surface\ncoatings. In the pharmaceutical industry,\npolar aprotic solvents such as DMF are broadly used for specific subsets\nof reactions (SNAr, amide bond formation, solid-phase peptide\nsynthesis) exploiting its relatively high boiling point, and its ability\nto solubilize a wide range of drug-like molecules as well as in crystallization\nprocesses in which the miscibility with water (as an effective antisolvent)\nis taken advantage of. DMF has a boiling\npoint of 153 °C, though it is purified through distillation under\nreduced pressure to avoid potential decomposition. Although this is not reported to occur until much higher\ntemperatures, disproportionation leading to CO and dimethyl amine can be observed in some reaction media, while\nthere have been instances of DMF vapors traveling back to an ignition\nsource leading to a flashback. DMF has been extensively used\nas a solvent for synthetic reactions utilizing the widely employed\nstrong base sodium hydride. This is mainly due to the solvent’s\nability to solubilize both organic and inorganic compounds. However,\ndespite the prevalence of this practice, the hazards associated with\nthe thermal instability of NaH/DMF mixtures particularly on scale-up\nare significantly underappreciated and seldom discussed within the\nchemistry community. Thermal decomposition\nof a NaH/DMF mixture was first observed in the 1960s with further\nincidents reported since in the literature, while calorimetric studies\ndemonstrated that these mixtures can self-heat at temperatures often\nin an unpredictable manner though at temperatures as low as 26 °C.\nA more detailed report of the explosive hazard of NaH in DMF was published\nin 2019, and while this combination is rarely seen now in scale-up\nsynthetic routes, it is still utilized in medicinal chemistry laboratories,\nand this is a practice that should be highly discouraged. In a similar manner, studies have also demonstrated\nthat solutions of NBS in DMF undergo a hazardous thermal decomposition\nat low temperature with a safe working temperature for a 22 wt % solution\nestablished to be 32 °C. Probing\nthis phenomenon highlighted a possible autocatalytic mechanism for\ndecomposition with further investigations carried out to establish\nthe role of concentration/materials, etc., on both the onset temperature\nand the overall energy output. Like DMF, DMA is included on the candidate list for REACH within\nthe EU as a substance of very high concern (SVHC) owing primarily\nto acute toxicity and its reported propensity to lead to damage the\nliver. In addition, it is on the Hazardous\nSubstance List owing to citations from a range of regulatory organizations.\nDMA is a colorless liquid that is hygroscopic and miscible with water.\nIt is reported to have a faint ammonia-like odor with an odor threshold\nof 47 ppm though the range of accepted odor thresholds can be quite\nbroad thus highlighting that caution should be exercised in relying\non odor alone as a warning for potentially hazardous exposures. In addition to being employed in medicinal chemistry\nlaboratories, DMA is used as a solvent for plastics, resins, and gums. In research, its employment as a solvent is\noften to exploit its polarity, relatively high boiling point, and\nability to effectively solubilize a broad range of both organic and\ninorganic compounds. This miscibility with water also presents an\nopportunity in the crystallization space in which the aqueous component\nacts as an “anti-solvent”. DMA has a boiling point of 165 °C being again distilled under\nvacuum to avoid thermal disproportionation, which leads to dimethylamine\nbeing produced. DMA has a flashpoint\nof 63 °C and an autoignition temperature of 490 °C with\nthe potential for containers to explode when heated (note that both\nproduct and empty containers should be kept away from heat and sources\nof ignition). In a similar manner to DMF, DMA has also been\nwidely employed as a solvent for reactions involving the strong base\nNaH. Process safety studies have confirmed that this results in a\nmixture that possesses a propensity for self-heating with the formation\nof noncondensable gasesous products during thermal decomposition,\nthus presenting a viable scenario for a runaway reaction. GC studies\nherein showed that the release of H2 occurred at a lower\ntemperature than with the NaH/DMF sample with methane, ethane, acetylene,\nand CO also been observed as being formed. Avoiding using NaH/DMA\neven in discovery-scale reactions is strongly recommended. NMP (1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone)\nis reported on the REACH authorization list as an SVHC owing to its\ntoxicity profile specifically that the compound may be a teratogen\nin humans leading to malformation of embryos. In addition, it causes severe irritation to the skin and eyes and\nmay irritate the lungs. NMP is also listed on both the Right to Know\nHazardous Substance List (cited by DOT, DEP, NFPA, and EPA) and the\nSpecial Health Hazard Substance List. NMP is a colorless, hygroscopic\nliquid noted to have a “mild-amine”, fishy-like smell\nwith an odor threshold reported to be between 4 and 10 ppm though\nodor should not solely be used as an indicator to determine potential\nexposure. NMP is a combustible liquid\nand should be kept away from heat, sparks, and sources of ignition.\nNMP is widely used as a solvent in a variety of industries including\npaints/coatings removal, petrochemical processing, agricultural chemicals,\nelectronics cleaning, and industrial/domestic cleaning. The high boiling point of this solvent is exploited\nin synthetic chemistry, for example, in Cu-based Ullmann couplings, and again the miscibility with water can be\ntaken advantage of in developing suitable crystallizations for emerging\ndrug development candidates.\n\n## \n\nDMF is included on the candidate list for REACH (Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation)\nwithin the EU (ECHA – European Chemical Agency) as a substance\nof very high concern (SVHC) owing primarily to acute toxicity and\nits reported propensity to lead to adverse reproductive and developmental\neffects.

Specifically, the use of a solvent is key to enable mixing and mass transport between phases and can have an influence on both the rate and selectivity\n,\n of a particular\nprocess.\n,\n Perhaps the most important use\nof solvents is from a safety perspective, wherein the reaction medium\ntypically acts as a “heat sink” to control exotherms\narising from the reaction. Solvents also are widely utilized in techniques\ninvolved in product isolation and though we will not consider this\nhere, in cleaning protocols. While many\nare beyond the scope of this perspective, it is important to note\nthat several suggested “greener alternatives” have been\ninvestigated that avoid the use of a conventional reaction solvent\nincluding running reactions neat, solid-phase\nreactions as well as employing surfactants\nto enable chemistry in aqueous media or exploring emerging options for conducting reactions such as ionic\nliquids or supercritical fluids. It cannot be overemphasized how important the\nselection of a solvent is not only in dissolving and dispersing the reaction\nparticipants but also in being of the appropriate polarity to promote the chemistry (SN2, E1CB, etc.) and through modification of the solute properties\n(redox potential, pKa, H-bonding). Add to this the benefits gained through removing impurities/byproducts\nthrough partitioning, and isolation\nof the desired product by crystallization demonstrates how selection of the right solvent from the outset\ncan alleviate issues with downstream processing. The contribution of the solvent toward the Process Mass\nIntensity (PMI) of a process only exacerbates this decision and most\nnotably how the potential hazards arising from this should be minimized. The ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical Roundtable (ACS-GCIPR)\nwas established in 2005 when the ACS Green Chemistry Institute and\na handful of pharmaceutical companies saw an opportunity to work together\nin a precompetitive manner to promote green chemistry and engineering\ninnovation. One of the major initiatives of the ACS-GCIPR is the development\nof a robust suite of tools that embrace\ncommonly agreed-upon metrics and support chemists’ choices\naround material and method selection to maximize resource efficiency,\nminimize hazards, and reduce waste and cost over the life cycle of\nthe process. While initially developed\nby and for the pharmaceutical industry, it should be emphasized that\nthese tools are also useful and accessible to the broader chemistry\nand chemical engineering communities. Two such resources have been developed with respect to solvent selection,\nnamely a solvent guide and a solvent\nselection tool. While the former provides\ntabulated information ranking solvents through evaluation of various\nproperties, the latter allows a more prospective approach to solvent\nselection/optimization through identification of suitable reaction\nmedia utilizing the desired properties to facilitate the process as\ninputs. While the properties of a solvent are key to making\nan informed\ndecision, there are other factors that need to be considered. Obviously,\nthe chemistry must work, and it is important that the solvent is also\ninert under the reaction conditions, while enabling the workup/isolation\nof the desired product can also streamline the process. Solvent recovery\nand potential for recycling should be considered, while safety and\npotential hazards to both health and the environment are critical.\nOverall cost not only to purchase the material but also to dispose\nof the waste stream in compliance with the relevant legislation must\nbe kept in mind. The term “green solvent” is widely\nemployed in the chemistry literature, and it is important to establish\ncriteria for a material to meet with this definition. Specifically, a material should be derived\nfrom a renewable feedstock and place low demands on the energy required\nto produce it. The solvent should also be biodegradable, insoluble\nin water, and have a midrange boiling point in that it is not too\nlow as to be considered a VOC and not too high in that it is difficult\nto recycle. Married to these characteristics should be the properties\nof materials that are considered to be “safe” solvents\nwith high stability, low flammability (high FP) and low to moderate\ntoxicity. Often during discussions regarding the development/utilization\nof solvents, the environmental impacts associated with the overall\nmanufacture of the materials are overlooked though they are a vital\npart of the complete picture. While a detailed discussion of this\nis beyond the scope of this perspective, it is, however, critical\nfor the scientist to have knowledge of the factors involved to allow\nfor both the judicious selection of current reaction solvents to be\nmade as well as a critical benchmarking of the processes reported\nto produce emerging “greener” reaction solvents. In\naddition, when considering aspects of worker safety, it is important\nalso to consider workers associated with the various manufacturing\nprocesses in addition to the end user. In many cases, the manufacturing\nprocesses for a solvent are energy-intensive and generate significant\ngreenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to climate change, with\nthis issue being exacerbated by the requisite transportation of solvents\nto various locations for use. As noted, many solvents are volatile\norganic compounds (VOCs) that vaporize quickly at room temperature\nand, during manufacture, can escape into the atmosphere. Reactions\noccur with other chemicals contributing to ground-level ozone, which\nis a component of smog. Not only does this contribute to air pollution\nbut also leads to impacts on health, such as causing respiratory issues\nand triggering asthma. Many manufacturing processes for solvents also\ngenerate wastewater that can often contain chemical pollutants, with\nstringent control measures required to prevent these entering waterways\nto contaminate aquatic ecosystems. With newer reaction media, much\nonus is placed on these being derived from renewable feedstocks as\nmost of the current solvents we utilize are derived from oil and gas,\nwhich are finite resources, though the overall proposed manufacture\nof a new solvent (or a conventional solvent from renewable feedstocks)\nhas to be considered as more hazardous processes may be involved if\na biobased feedstock is employed as the raw material. In addition, for a complete lifecycle analysis\nof a solvent to be derived, the extraction/processing of the raw materials\nalso needs to be considered. While developing\nnewer reaction media represents an aspirational long-term goal, one\nkey factor which should be implemented where viable to mitigate the\nenvironmental impact of a solvent is solvent recovery/recycling systems\nthat reduce waste and can save costs/resources through enabling reuse\nof a solvent. However, in discovery,\nimplementing such systems is often not viable owing to the scales\ninvolved, while in pharmaceutical industry development/manufacturing,\nthere are regulatory guidelines to comply with.\n\n## Solvent Guides/Tables\nAs noted, there are numerous\nsolvent guides readily available, though they all represent variations\non a theme most notably in how the relevant information is presented.\nBehind each of these guides, though, three common themes emerge: worker\nsafety, process safety, and environmental and regulatory considerations.\nThese are then broken down into various subcategories, which can be\n“scored” for each of the solvents under consideration\nbased on the available data, with the range of scores across categories\nthen weighted according to the specific guide to provide an overall\ndesirability for each specific solvent (and class). Typically, the\nguides are presented in a manner that allows granular decisions to\nbe made based not only on the overall rankings of solvents but also\non differentiation in the three areas defined above. Within these,\nfor worker safety, carcinogenicity,\nmutagenicity, reprotoxicity, skin absorption/sensitization, and toxicity\nare typically considered, while for process safety, flammability,\npotential for high emissions (high vapor pressure), peroxide formation, static charge, and odor issues are considered.\nFinally, ecotoxicity, potential groundwater contamination, EHS regulatory restrictions, ozone depletion, photoreactivity, and compliance with all relevant\nlegislation are all part of an evaluation of environmental and regulatory\nconsiderations. A survey of the\nsolvent selection guides published shows there to be approximately\n67% agreement in terms of the classifications of the materials evaluated.\nWhile there is excellent agreement in terms of most solvents that\nare either recommended or highly hazardous, there are discrepancies\ndistinguishing between recommended/problematic or problematic/hazardous\nclassifications based on a different weighting of the criteria used\nin the assembly of discrete guides. The IMI-Chem21 project funded\nthrough the EFPIA (European Foundation of Pharmaceutical Industries\nand Associations) and the European Union comprised of a number of\ncompanies (including several pharmaceutical companies) and universities\nwith the overall remit to develop sustainable biological and chemical\nmethodologies both through supporting research as well as providing\ntraining packages. One of the components\nof the latter was the development of a common solvent selection guide\nto allow a preliminary assessment of a solvent’s desirability\nto be used for scale-up purposes in the fine chemical industry. This\nguide not only includes classical solvents, but also is extended to\nnewer solvents as well as highlighting bioderived solvents. Although the guide was assembled as part of\na collaborative effort, like in all such endeavors, there are potential\ngaps in the methodology used with suggestions that the health criteria\nshould be based on OEL (Occupational Exposure Limit) while the environmental scoring should include the CO2 synthesis impact/GWP (Global Warming Potential). However, it is stressed that the tool is intended\nfor a preliminary assessment, with further discussion encouraged in\nspecific cases to challenge the ranking. For the Chem21 solvent\nguide, the scoring (score in each category\nbetween 1 and 10) and ranking are determined as follows. The physical\ndata and GHS (globalized harmonized system) hazard statements are collected from the SDS, and the safety\nscore is calculated using the flash point, autoignition temperature,\nresistivity, ability to form peroxides, etc. This proves the easiest\nto establish as while the health score reflecting the occupational\nhazard would most ideally be linked to the OELs, these are only established\nfor the most common solvents, and in addition, these threshold limits\nare not unified. The health score is therefore linked to the most\nstringent H3xx statement, thus capturing the potential severity of\nthe hazard as well as the range of impact. To these scores, a modifier\nof “plus 1” is added if the boiling point is less than\n86 °C. For solvents with incomplete toxicological data, a default\nscore of 5 is assigned. The environmental scoring is still not complete\nbased on lack of data for some materials though it is based on boiling\npoint as well as the nature of the H4xx statement. For each solvent,\nthree scores (HS&E) are determined with the ranking determined\nby a combination of these. Solvents with one score >8 or two scores\n>7 are classified as “hazardous” (red), one score\n=\n7 or two scores between 4 and 6 are assigned “problematic”\n(yellow), while all other solvents are “recommended”\n(green). The version of the guide showing 53 common solvents\nis shown in Figure \n. As the ranking\nsystem does not distinguish between “hazardous” and\n“highly hazardous” solvents, several have been defined\nas the latter based on group discussion. With the methodology, 36\nsolvents present a clear ranking with an 81% concordance with that\nobtained from the survey of the other published solvent selection\nguides, though it should be noted that in some cases this tool underestimates\nboth the health and safety hazards presented by a specific solvent.\nIn the cases in which a clear ranking was not determined, the default\nappears to be close to that previously reported.

This methodology was also applied to a series of\nemerging solvents\nthat have been purported as “greener” replacements for\nclassical solvents. The data are presented in Figure \n, and while highlighting the value of some\nof these alternative reaction media, it also serves to focus on areas\nin which more information is needed regarding both their ecotoxicity\nand general toxicity profiles. For some as well, it is also key to\nensuring reaction compatibility prior to utilization. Chem21 solvent selection\nguide: Emerging “greener”\nsolvents. Reproduced from ref.  with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\n## ACS-GCIPR Solvent Selection Tool\n“What would\nserve as a suitable replacement solvent” is a typical question\nthat arises during the optimization of a chemical reaction, and usually,\nthe obvious answer to this is to consider homologues of what the currently\nemployed solvent is. For example, we replaced methanol with ethanol.\nHowever, this analysis can be somewhat flawed as it offers the question\nas to not only whether ethanol is the best alternative but also whether\nmethanol was actually the best starting point. An alternative way\nto consider this is to find a way to define whether solvents are “similar”\nor “different” in behavior beyond simple chemical functionality\nand to search for the ideal solvent based on the needs of the reaction.\nWhile the solvent selection guides, we have considered aid in identifying\nsolvents, they are typically utilized for postselection comparison\nbetween the solvent options. While this is valuable, it should be\nconsidered that often making an objective decision can be compromised\nby several factors, notably, what solvents are readily in hand, what\ndid the chemist use last time for such a transformation, or the commercial\navailability of the solvent. With these factors in mind, the choice\nof solvent is restricted to a simple consideration of the chemistry\n(polarity, incompatible functionality, and temperature range). The ACS-GCIPR solvent selection tool reverses this philosophy and\nfocuses on the molecular properties as opposed to the solvents themselves\nand looks to see the properties that will either interfere with or\nfacilitate the proposed process with the ideal selection envisioned\nto work across the reaction, workup, and isolation steps. The tool\nfeatures 272 solvents including research, process, and next-generation\ngreen solvents with ∼100 options included for the user to filter/highlight\nto help identify the best for their given reaction. Included herein\nare a range of 30 physicochemical properties for each solvent including\nrudimentary experimental data like boiling/melting points, viscosity,\nor other safety markers like flash/ignition points, which can be combined\nwith properties that capture aspects of the solvent’s polarity,\npolarizability, and hydrogen-bonding ability, such as dielectric constants,\ndipole moments, or Hansen parameters to name a few. The filter tab\nalso allows the user to select or discard different functional groups\nin order to restrict the output to a given class of solvents. Other\ncategories that can be evaluated are impacts on health, environmental\neffects on air and water, life-cycle assessment, and ICH solvent information\n(Figure \n). What the\ntool intends to do is to enable the user to define the requirements\nof their application with a set of 272 solvents and then be dynamically\ninterrogated to provide a shortlist of hits meeting these parameters. ACS-GCIPR\nsolvent selection tool. The objectivity highlighted through the solvent\nselection tool\nrepresents the key differentiator in that during this phase of the\nworkflow leading to the identification of the shortlist, the specific\nidentities of the solvents are never explicitly revealed. This serves\nto not only remove any inherent biases but also facilitate the opportunity\nto identify less obvious solvents that may be potentially advantageous\nfor a specific application. At this juncture, it is instructive\nto learn how the tool works\nand to validate its performance given the body of knowledge that the\nscientific community has accumulated over time regarding classical\nsolvents. The first challenge is to break down each solvent into a\nseries of descriptors with many of these being identified, such as\nchemical functionality, molecular descriptors, physical properties,\nregulatory classification, legal controls, environmental impact, and\nhealth and safety performance with numerous subcategories present\nin many of these. In evaluating a solvent for a specific purpose,\nsome or all of these descriptors could be important in making the\nright decision, while it can be challenging making comparisons while\nbalancing the impact of a wide range of parameters. To achieve this\nand enable identifying “similar” and “different”\noptions, it is necessary to represent solvents at a level beyond the\nindividual molecular properties. For this purpose, using a multivariate\ntechnique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows many potentially\ncorrelated parameters to be reduced to a small number of descriptors. For the solvent data, PCA identified 5 principal\ncomponents, enabling a model to be generated to distribute the solvents\nin 5-dimensional space (PC1 through PC5). There have been various\nreports on utilizing PCA for the analysis of solvents though a facile\nmethod to understand this is that when considering how a solvent may\ninteract with a solute, there are several potential mechanisms that\nmay be at play, which may all depend to varying degrees of different\nproperties of the solvent molecule under consideration. Given this, PCA is an established method to\n“combine” and “weight” a series of experimental/computed\nproperties of a solvent into discrete parameters (PC1, PC2, etc.)\nto enable benchmarking/comparison studies of solvents to be carried\nout effectively using the selection tool. The default view in\nthe tool is the projection in the plane of\nthe most dominant descriptors (PC1, PC2), and initial validation of\nthe tool can be derived when one visualizes solvents with the same\nprimary functionality (homologues within the same series) across these\ntwo vectors with the outcome that they occur in very close proximity\nto each other on the plot. From a high-level perspective, PC1 is the\ndominant descriptor representing a global lipophilicity (hydrophobicity)-polarity\nscale, while PC2 captures the next most significant characteristics\nand provides a representation of the hydrogen-bonding ability of a\nsolvent. Subsequent PCs (PC3–PC5) account for progressively\nsmaller amounts of the total variance, signifying finer distinctions\nin a solvent’s properties (volume, 3D shape, surface area,\netc.). Within the analysis, it is important to bear in mind that a\nspecific property/molecular descriptor can be embedded into multiple\nPCs though with a variation in terms of its weighting/contribution\nto that global property. In addition to validation of the generated\nPCA map through observed clustering of a related chemical series of\nesters, correlation with observed chemical phenomena (keto-enol tautomerism, O- vs C-alkylation, rates of SNAr reactions, etc.) provides further authentication of the value\nof this approach. While it is intuitive to infer that those solvents\nin proximity on the map are similar, this may not be the case in all\ndimensions, demonstrating that solvents that at first inspection appear\nvery different (for example, in terms of functionality) may offer\nmore similarities than simple chemical functionality may suggest,\nthus highlighting the value of this approach (Figure \n). While the background to how the data are\ncompiled and validated is useful to know, many users can exploit the\ntool simply to provide a graphical view of the solvent shortlist. ACS-GCIPR\nsolvent selection tool: Comparing solvents through PCA\nanalysis. Figure \n illustrates\ntwo high-level scenarios in which the value of utilization of the\nsolvent selection tool might be realized. The first is a screening\nscenario in which a new reaction is being considered, and it is not\nclear what is required in terms of solvent properties for the application\n(Figure \na). The remit\nbeing screening already implies that there is only limited information\navailable to start a search, and as such the exercise is truly holistic.\nHerein identifying an initial hit is useful, and then applying appropriate\nfilters will provide a shortlist of possible alternatives to evaluate.\nGiven the nature of the exercise, avoiding aggressive application\nof the filters is beneficial. Furthermore, when the desired view has\nbeen generated, a selection of representative solvent candidates from\ndiscrete quadrants will provide a first-pass evaluation as to the\ndesirable property space for the solvent for the transformation under\ninvestigation. Utilization of the ACS-GCIPR solvent selection tool: (a)\nScreening\nfor new potential reaction solvents; (b) Solvent optimization/replacement. A second scenario is perhaps more clear-cut being\nan optimization\nin which an initial hit is known (perhaps identified through screening),\nthough replacement options are desired (Figure \nb). In this case, it is reasonable to expect\nthat proximal solvents to the initial hit on the PCA map will provide\nsome degree of “similar” behavior. With this, applying\nfilters to a localized subset should provide a reasonable starting\npoint, while expanding/reducing the scope of these criteria is possible\ndepending on the scope/goals of the optimization study. In this scenario,\nthe tool serves as an “idea generator” and evaluating\nacross the various components while filtering using the properties\noptions allows a user to generate a “shortlist” that\ncan then be experimentally evaluated through a further screening campaign.\nThe ease of use and speed of the tool allow this to be achieved in\na relatively expeditious manner.\n\n## Analysis of Solvent Usage in Common Reactions\nOften,\nthe selection of a solvent for a specific transformation is based\non legacy experience, and given this and the established nature of\norganic synthesis, we hypothesized that certain synthetic transformations\nare more likely to rely on hazardous or problematic solvents than\nothers. Given this, we sought to gain a more thorough understanding\non which reaction classes have placed a strong reliance on what we\nwould consider to be poor solvent selections. To achieve this, we\nrevisited the solvent usage habits across the Medicinal Chemistry\ncommunity by surveying what reaction media were used for the most\nrecurrent synthetic transformation classes as previously identified\nfrom the experimentals of J. Med. Chem. by Brown\nand Bostrom in 2016.\n,\n In addition to these fundamental\nreactions, the central role that heterocyclic systems play in medicinal\nchemistry is also taken into account with the analysis extended to\nevaluate “heterocyclic synthesis”, which provides data\non the solvents utilized for reactions employed in the formation of\n3, 4, 5, and 6-membered heteroatom-containing rings (N, O, and S). We conducted our SciFinder-n survey on these\ntransformations across a broader time frame (2000–2021) though\nonce again limiting the scope of our investigation to articles from J. Med. Chem. Each synthetic transformation was defined\nby a structural search with remarkably ∼70% of the total reactions\nundertaken coming from just six of the 20 classes (excluding “heterocycle\nsynthesis” from this analysis as this covers a broader range\nof reaction types) that were evaluated (Figure \n). Common transformations in medicinal chemistry\n(J. Med.\nChem. 2000–2021). A visual depiction of the solvent usage data is\ndisplayed in Figure \n in which the number\nof incidences of the use of undesirable solvents is expressed as a\npercentage of the total number of occurrences for each specific reaction\nclass. It can be noted in the analyses presented that in addition\nto granular metrics regarding the use of the unsustainable solvents\nhighlighted in this review, data on a subset of other “hazardous”\nsolvents are presented. Although this category features a range of\nsolvents that are employed on a more sporadic basis, it demonstrates\nthat benzene, pyridine, carbon tetrachloride (and other chlorinated solvents), di-iso-propyl ether\n,\n and HMPA have all been used as reaction media within\nmedicinal chemistry programs, and as with the featured unsustainable\nsolvents, replacing these materials in reactions of interest is strongly\nrecommended. Percentage uses of the solvents/reaction class. Overall, evaluating the data, it can clearly be\nseen that across\nall reaction classes the use of the problematic solvents DMF and DCM\nis prevalent, though despite this and the lesser use of solvents such\nas Et2O, DME, dioxane, DCE, and NMP, the latter group still\nsees significant use and throughout these applications, the potential\nreplacement with greener alternatives would be beneficial. In addition,\nthe data demonstrate that often a specific solvent is selected for\na discrete reaction class, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that solvent\nselection is often based on legacy experience. Examples of this observation\ninclude 1,4-dioxane for Suzuki–Miyaura (∼26%), Buchwald–Hartwig couplings (∼28%), and Boc protection/deprotections (∼11/13%); DME for Suzuki–Miyaura couplings (∼14%) and notably diethyl ether for the addition\nof organometallic reagents to electrophiles (∼17%) (e.g., Grignard\nreactions). Notably for these applications\ninvolving ethereal solvents, medicinal chemists are encouraged to\ntest more environmentally benign derivatives like 2-MeTHF and CPME (vide infra), which have been reported to perform in a comparative\nmanner to those historically used for these applications. Further analysis of these data showed\nthat among the 20 reaction\nclasses, two (amide formation and oxidation of alcohols) used unsustainable\nsolvents in ∼70% of the reported instances, while a further\ngroup of 9 transformations was performed in hazardous reaction solvents\nwith between 50% and 70% probability (Figure \n). In contrast, only 7 of the reaction classes\nwere performed in undesirable solvents less than 40% of the number\nof times that they were reported. Almost half of the ∼35k amine\nalkylations were reported in undesirable solvents with 33% using DMF.\nSimilarly, ester formation (∼15k hits) was also carried out\n∼50% of the time using undesirable solvents (DCM 31%, DMF 13%),\nwhich is somewhat surprising given that these could be avoided if\nenvironmentally benign reaction media such as alcoholic systems are\nused with an acid catalyst. The exponential growth of Pd-mediated\ncouplings over the past 20 years is highlighted by ∼29k examples\nof Suzuki–Miyaura couplings being reported in the journal with\nover half of these using hazardous solvents most notably those that\nare potential carcinogens (1,4-dioxane 26%; DME 14%).\n, Overall utilization of nonsustainable/hazardous solvents. While these data are interesting, it is perhaps\nmore instructive\nto focus on what solvent choices are made for the most popular reactions\ncurrently carried out within medicinal chemistry programs. The most\npopular is amide bond formation, which is reported on >63k occasions\nutilizing DCM or DMF in 28% or 36% respectively of those instances.\n,\n In contrast, the formation of heterocycles represents the second\nmost prevalent transformation (∼56k) using hazardous solvents\n∼32% of the time with either DCM or DMF being employed equally\nin almost two-thirds of these occurrences. Strategies commonly invoked\nfor SAR investigations involve employing reactions to efficiently\nforge carbon-heteroatom bonds around the periphery of a core bioactive\nscaffold. Several transformations allow for the robust formation of\nC–N bonds with broad substrate scope enabling their application\nin parallel library format to access collections of related molecules\nto expedite SAR studies. Specifically, from our data, C­(sp2)–N/O bond formation (most notably Buchwald-Hartwig couplings),\nnitrogen alkylation, and reductive amination are exemplified on ∼64k occasions with\n47% of these being carried out in solvents, which are “undesirable”.\nFor each of these transformations, one can easily identify research\nopportunities to develop replacements for dioxane (28%, C­(sp2-N/O bond formation), DMF (33%, nitrogen alkylation) and chlorinated\nmedia (29%, reductive amination) for these reactions. There are ∼39k reports of Boc deprotections,\nand the data from these highlight one of the challenges often faced\nwithin a Discovery Chemistry environment. Herein for convenience,\na commercial solution of HCl in 1,4-dioxane (4 M) is extensively utilized\nas the reagent, thus leading to ∼13% of the reactions being\ncarried out using this solvent (this is like the statement above regarding\nthe use of diethyl ether for Grignard reactions given that many of\nthese reagents are supplied commercially as solutions in this solvent). DCM is also extensively used for Boc deprotections\n(∼33% of the time, typically with TFA) while DMF is also often encountered (∼12%) in this\ntransformation. It is worth noting that all three of these solvents\n(DCM, dioxane, and DMF) are also regularly used in reactions to install\nthe Boc-protecting group. One further observation from the data is\nthat there is a significant disparity in the reaction data between\nthe number of instances in which a Boc-protecting group is installed\nas opposed to its removal, with the latter dominating by almost 10-fold.\nAt first glance, this would appear to be counterintuitive as one would\nexpect these reactions to be somewhat equivalent. However, discovery\nchemistry programs rely to a large degree on the commercial availability\nof orthogonally protected building blocks and monomers to elaborate\ncompounds to investigate chemical space. Given this within our programs,\nthe Boc-protected amine is often employed as a starting material,\nand thus, only the removal is carried out within our laboratories. From our survey, the six transformations described thus far account\nfor almost 70% of the reactions described with the remaining 14 reaction\nclasses accounting for the remainder. However, distinct trends emerge in the analysis of this subset of\ndata. Notably, the reduction of aromatic nitro groups to anilines\nappears to exhibit the most benign solvent profile with this typically\ncarried out in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, EtOAc, and THF\nin contrast to examples in more problematic reaction media (13%). Perhaps this is not surprising given that this\ntransformation is often carried out via hydrogenation with a heterogeneous\ncatalyst and the typical solvents used\npresent favorable properties in terms of both solubilizing the gas\nand facilitating the mass transfer between the three phases. While selecting a potential solvent for this\nreaction, one can prioritize using either an alcohol or EtOAc for\nthis transformation, specifically when the significant energy considerations\nassociated with the manufacture of THF are considered. This though\nis very much the exception with, for example, DMF being frequently\nused across phenol alkylation (35%), ester formation (13%), O-debenzylation\n(6%) and C­(sp2)–N/C­(sp2)–O bond\nformations (7%). As noted, the latter also frequently uses dioxane\n(28%), while another ethereal solvent DME is employed in ∼14%\nof Suzuki–Miyaura couplings. The analysis of this subset of\nreaction classes also highlights DCM as a “go-to” solvent\nfor numerous transformations including alcohol oxidations (54%, often\nin tandem with the Dess–Martin periodinane of related hypervalent-iodine-based\nreagents), sulfonamide synthesis (40%),\nester formation (31%) O- (20%), and N-debenzylations (15%). A rationale\npresented for the prevalent use of solvents such as DMF and DCM in\nmedicinal chemistry is often their ability to solubilize a broad range\nof organic molecules, though AI/ML-based\npredictive methods for compound solubility are emerging, which may\nprovide an opportunity to select more sustainable reaction media based\nspecifically on the substrate of interest. With these data in hand, one can immediately reach the conclusion\nthat significant impacts in terms of sustainability can be gained\nwithin a medicinal chemistry program simply by developing “greener”\nconditions specifically with the use of more environmentally benign\nsolvents for the transformation. To achieve this, the data were further\nrefined to highlight not only the most recurrent reaction classes\nbut also those that typically employ undesirable solvents. This led\nus to identify the following 12 transformations, which would benefit\nfrom greener reaction conditions with the numbers in parentheses representing\nan approximate “count” of the occasions that this reaction\nhas been performed in a hazardous solvent in the period under review.\nThese are amide formation (45k), Boc deprotection (26k), amine alkylation\n(18k), synthesis of heterocycles (18k), Suzuki–Miyaura coupling\n(16k), ester hydrolysis (9k), reductive amination (8k), sulfonamide\nsynthesis (8k), ester hydrolysis (8k), phenol alkylation (7k), C­(sp2)–N/C­(sp2)–O bond formations (4k),\nand oxidation of alcohols (4k). However, despite what might appear\nto be a somewhat bleak outlook, from our extensive literature review,\nfor all of these transformations noted here, there exist numerous\nexamples in which the reactions are conducted under more sustainable\nconditions. In the next section, a series of these have been collated\nfor each transformation in a readily accessible format, thus enabling\nthese to be investigated as potential “first-pass” conditions\nupon encountering a new substrate without the need for extensive literature\nresearch.\n\n## Toward Greener Conditions for Commonly Used Transformations\nThere are several approaches that can be adopted to pursue greener\nconditions for a specific transformation under investigation. As highlighted,\nthe choice of solvent plays a major role in assessing the overall\nsustainability of the reaction not only through the relative volume\nof possible waste generated but also through its potentially undesirable\nproperties (toxicity, etc.). Considering this, the strategy of straight\nsubstitution of the solvent for a more sustainable medium presents\na logical path forward, and this can be greatly facilitated using\na solvent guide as previously discussed. This has successfully been\nimplemented and reported on several occasions for example, the replacement\nof DCM with 2-MeTHF for amide bond formations, switching DMF for more\nrecently developed polar aprotic solvents like cyrene or dimethyl isosorbide in SNAr reactions,\nand replacing ether with 2-MeTHF for Grignard chemistry. An extension\nof this approach is offered through the solvent selection tool, which\nenables the user to utilize the most desirable properties that the\nreaction medium should possess to mediate the transformation of interest\n(polarity, pKa etc.) and then apply these to identify\nsolvents that may be of value. With a specific transformation\nin mind, the ACS-GCIPR Reagents Guide presents an excellent resource\nin providing a starting point for conditions to explore for a given\nreaction. Currently this tool covers 29 transformations demonstrating\nfor each the possible reagents to be utilized in a simple Venn diagram\nformat, in which conditions are assigned based on criteria around\n“wide substrate scope”, “applicability to scale”,\nand “greenness”. Naturally those results found at the\nintersection of the three circles represent a “sweet spot”\nin terms of overall applicability and sustainability (Figure \n). However, within medicinal\nchemistry programs, the objective is often speed, and as such, conditions\nthat have been shown previously to have worked for a wide variety\nof examples are the most compelling, though these are often found\nto not be particularly attractive from a green perspective. Annotated\nACS-GCIPR reagent guide Venn diagram (alcohol oxidation). The strategies so far discussed focus on either\nthe choice of solvent\nor reagent selection for a specific transformation, which overlooks\nthe fact that these two discrete parameters are often critically interrelated.\nOn most occasions when a medicinal chemist is confronted with a new\nchemical series to work on, they will search a database (either a\ncommercial offering such as SciFinder or an institutional ELN: Electronic\nLab Notebook) for reactions that have been run on similar substrates\nto provide initial conditions to test. With this workflow, it is highly\nlikely to perpetuate chemically successful, albeit nonenvironmentally\nsustainable reaction conditions given that the methods previously\nutilized were largely developed in a time when the importance of sustainability\nwas not as widely recognized. Based on our extensive data mining\ndescribed for obtaining the\nsolvent usage information, herein we propose an alternative strategy\nfor the choice of initial reaction conditions to evaluate when faced\nwith a novel chemical series. Collected in Table \n, one will find a selection of at least three\ncurrent, more environmentally sustainable conditions for each of the\nten most common reaction types observed in JMC as previously discussed.\nThe proposed conditions are ordered from “more conservative”\nat the top to “further from precedent” at the bottom,\nand we suggest that these can be utilized in situations when a medicinal\nchemist is confronted with either a new substrate/chemical series\nor perhaps even better when trying to “green” a current\nreaction. Each reaction shows a specific substrate with the reaction\nconditions and the corresponding references, thus eliminating the\nneed for the chemist to look up alternate sources, and it is envisioned\nthat Table \n will serve\nas a valuable resource for “green” conditions for the\nabove (12) most common reaction types. To assist in both its uptake\nand overall utility, a poster version of this information has been\nmade available in the Supporting Information for use as a Quick Reference Guide. The overall approach suggested\nherein is unique in not only in marrying the reagents/solvents for\na specific transformation but also for the fact that in many cases\nthe selected examples have been performed on pharmaceutically relevant\nsubstrates, thus somewhat mitigating common concerns regarding substrate\nsolubility under a specific set of reaction conditions, which is often\na major challenge when a simple “solvent swap” is implemented\nto “green” a reaction.\n,,,−\n\n## Analysis of Solvent Usage in Workup/Purification\nIt\nhas been widely recognized throughout the industry that the major\ncontributors to the PMI of a chemical reaction are solvents and water,\nand while this is well established particularly in chemical development,\nmedicinal chemists often use large volumes of water and organic solvents\nparticularly in the extractive workup of chemical transformations. In fact, the elimination of such workups and\ntheir replacement with solvent swaps through distillation to telescope reaction steps represents a common strategy to drive down PMI numbers\nwithin chemical development. In order\nto assay the impact of solvent usage for workup and purification (vide infra) within the medicinal chemistry research phase,\na similar survey to that described previously was conducted of published J. Med. Chem. procedures between 2000 and 2021. To streamline\nthe analysis, a representative sampling of four publications was chosen\nfrom each year for a total of 80 publications over the 20-year span\nleading to 1874 experiments being reviewed. Of these experiments,\nit was shown that 53% utilized an extractive aqueous workup procedure\n(Figure \n).\n,\n In the remaining cases, an extractive workup is avoided either through\ndirect precipitation of solutes through addition of an antisolvent\nor through a simple evaporation to yield the crude product. In contrast to the range of solvents used for\nreactions, the options for extraction are more limited based on the\nrequirement for them to be essentially immiscible with water, and\nthose utilized in the reactions surveyed are collected in Figure \n. Pleasingly from\na sustainability perspective, over half of the analyzed reactions\nused EtOAc (54%) as the solvent for extraction. However, 31% of the reactions utilized hazardous chlorinated\nsolvents, while 7% used extremely flammable diethyl ether, which is\nalso prone to peroxide formation. The survey also clearly reveals\nthat there has been little to no uptake in medicinal chemistry settings\nof newly emerging solvents such as MTBE, CPME, and 2-MeTHF for extractions. While these solvents can serve as greener and\nsafer alternatives to diethyl ether (the flashpoint of diethyl ether\nis −40 °C, while that of 2-MeTHF is −12 °C),\n2-MeTHF also presents an alternative to dichloromethane, which as\nnoted has both health and environmental concerns. From a practical\nperspective, 2-MeTHF (unlike THF) is immiscible with water and can\nthus be used to extract products directly from reaction mixtures without\nthe formation of emulsions, which is often a challenge with dichloromethane.\nOne of the drivers often presented for the use of chlorinated solvents\nfor extraction within medicinal chemistry is that the desired products\nare often highly polar and water-soluble, and as such diethyl ether\nand EtOAc are ineffective as extraction solvents. Recent work by Reetz and coworkers has identified n-butanol as an ecologically\nviable choice for such systems with this solvent proving to be particularly\neffective for the extraction of polar compounds from enzymatic processes. Furthermore, simply through reducing both the\nnumber of extractions employed during an aqueous workup and the volume\nof solvents utilized during the process can greatly reduce the overall\nPMI value of the transformation leading to a more sustainable outcome. Analysis of (a) methods of purification and\n(b) extractive workups\nin medicinal chemistry procedures. Solvents used in extractive workups (right schematic combines\nnonsustainable\nsolvents: see Table \n). In addition to workup conditions, the experimental\nprocedures were\nalso probed to assay the trends in the purification methods of choice\nwithin a medicinal chemistry setting. Of the 1874 reactions surveyed,\nca. 90% utilized a purification method of some kind (Figure \n), while the survey indicated\nthat in contrast to chemical development, telescoping reactions are\nnot regularly exploited in research settings with only 187 instances\nof this being encountered. It is self-evident that telescoping of\nreactions can lead to a reduction in solvent usage (reaction, workup,\nand purification) as well as potentially time and energy savings.\nIn contrast to development chemistry, telescoping represented only\n∼10% of this data set though this is probably not too surprising\nbased on the primary focus of the articles being the syntheses of\nmultiple discrete compounds for biological assays. The predominant\nmethod of purification (>50% of cases) was normal-phase chromatography\nusing a solid support, which in most cases is silica.\n,\n This group has previously published on concepts around “sustainability\nchromatography” providing not only a roadmap of potential alternatives\nto avoid chromatography but also suggested “greener”\nreplacements to commonly used mobile phases. The popularity of this method of purification has no doubt been\nmaintained through the ease of accessibility of simple to use, automated\nsystems that are prevalent throughout medicinal chemistry laboratories. The survey indicated that the predominant nonpolar\neluant in normal-phase chromatography was hexane, though from a Green\nChemistry perspective, this solvent should be replaced with cyclohexane\nor more preferably heptane (Figure \na). These latter solvents are significantly less toxic\nand thus have higher occupational exposure limits than hexane. The\nlower volatility of heptane compared to both hexane and pentane also\nleads to lower emissions and decreased environmental impact while\nalso representing less of a fire hazard. From a practical standpoint,\nthe higher boiling point of heptane often allows compounds to be precipitated\ndirectly upon evaporation of heptane/EtOAc mixtures. The survey also\nindicates that dichloromethane, most commonly in combination with\nmethanol, remains a common solvent utilized in medicinal chemistry\nsettings for chromatography. This is even though practical, straightforward,\nand more environmentally responsible alternatives to this toxic solvent\nhave been evaluated and proven to be effective. In particular, the\nsurvey indicated little uptake of a 3:1 mixture of EtOAc/ethanol (polar\neluent) and heptane (nonpolar eluent) as a recommended substitution\nfor dichloromethane even though the EtOAc/EtOH blend is now commercially\navailable and a much greener solvent alternative to dichloromethane/methanol\nmixtures. HPLC was also found to be\na common technique for product purification in medicinal chemistry\nlaboratories though evaporation/lyophilization of aqueous mixtures\ncan be relatively energy intensive.\n,\n SFC is often\npromoted as a “greener” method for product purification\n,\n though the survey revealed that this is rarely utilized probably\nowing to the nature of this technique (requiring high-pressure CO2 supply) thus restricting it to specialist purification laboratories.\n,\n The ACS-GCIPR have recently developed an Analytical Method Greenness\nScore (AMGS) tool, which can be utilized to benchmark and compare\ndirectly analytical methods. The AMGS\nmetric factors in both the impact of the solvent (health, safety,\nenvironmental, and waste), the energy demands of the instrumentation\nas well as the overall technique and highlights the sustainability\nbenefits that can be gained in selecting more modernized methods and\ntechniques without compromising separation performance.\n, Analysis of solvents used in (a) chromatography and (b) alternative\nworkups/purification methods. Impact of miniaturization on the reaction number/scale/solvent\nuse. Adapted from ref.  with permission from Elsevier.\n\n## The Role of Miniaturization and High-Throughput Experimentation\n(HTE) in Greener Solvent Selection and Reducing Solvent Usage\nWithin medicinal chemistry, access to milligram quantities of bioactive\ncompounds often suffices for initial profiling in relation to target\nbiology and metabolic stability, and as such the scale on which one\noperates becomes a critical consideration in minimizing waste. A successful discovery campaign will iteratively\nimprove on advanced compounds through a well-established “design,\nmake, test, analyze” cycle with\nspeed of execution being a critical factor leading to a heavy reliance\non parallel synthesis and reversed-phase/accelerated\napproaches to purification to drive\ndecision making. This oft-unstated emphasis on proceeding in an expeditious\nfashion can lead to a prioritization of compound numbers (diversity)\nat the expense of poor synthetic chemistry and thus sustainability. Miniaturization provides a complementary\nstrategy to solvent replacement in minimizing/reducing the pharmaceutical\nindustry’s footprint on global sustainability. Miniaturization and High Throughput Experimentation\n(HTE) are inseparable technologies, which have advanced in their ability\nto solve chemistry problems over the past 20 years. In one manifestation, HTE involves performing multiple\nchemical reactions in parallel, whether for the purpose of parallel\nevaluation of multiple conditions (one reaction, many sets of conditions)\nor for parallel synthesis (multiple reacting partners typically under\na common set of conditions). In comparison to reactions conducted\neither in dram vials or round-bottom flasks, decreasing the vessel\nsize to 8 × 30 mm (100 μL) or even 4 × 21 mm (25 μL)\nutilizes significantly reduced solvent volumes (Figure \n). Alternatively, reactions\ncan also be conducted in a 96-well (or 384/1536) plate format though solvent compatibility with plastics\n(e.g., polystyrene) needs to be taken into consideration. With advances in technologies such as analytical\ntechniques, tumble-stirring, inertion chambers, aluminum heating blocks, LED plates, biocatalysis, innovative approaches\nto reagent dosing, and parallel electrochemical\ndesigns, the majority of synthetic organic\nreactions can now be performed on a microscale (which we will define\nas ≤1 mg of substrate per reaction). Hypothetically, an array of 40 microscale reactions consumes the\nsame quantity of substrate (and solvent) as a single reaction at a\n1 mL scale (Figure \n). Potential impact of investment in HTE\non parallel medicinal chemistry. Uptake of both miniaturization and HTE can have\nprofound impacts\non sustainability and Green Chemistry goals, as demonstrated specifically\nthrough the following activities. Rapid Optimization Increases the Probability\nof Success for Parallel Synthesis\n – consider running an array of compounds under suboptimal\nconditions in which only 20% of reactions lead to the desired product.\nFor example, if there are 24 reactions (1 mL solvent each), with a\n20% success rate, only 5 analogs will be successfully obtained. Furthermore,\none strategy that is often adopted for poor-performing reactions is\nto increase the scale to ensure that “some” product\nis obtained leading to additional solvent use as well as potentially\nlaborious purification sequences. If, for example, a quick optimization\nis carried out using preplated catalysts, and the success rate were to be enhanced to 80%, 19 analogs will\nbe registered. To illustrate this as an estimate, Scenario A translates\nto 100 mL of solvent and uses 3.24 g of advanced intermediate (or\ntemplate), whereas Scenario B requires only ∼25 mL of solvent\nwhile now using 984 mg of compound. Further benefits are also realized\nwith reduced cycle time as well as reductions\nin waste generated owing to less starting template being used (e.g.,\ndiscarded nitrile gloves, test tubes, syringes, purification solvents,\nreaction workup waste) (Figure \n).\nLess is More.\nPushing the Boundary to Nanoscale\nSynthesis – there has long been a disconnect within\nmedicinal chemistry between the amount of compound synthesized compared\nto the amount of material needed for an initial biochemical assay,\nthough with additional recent advances, conducting reactions on vanishingly\nsmall quantities (0.05 mg) has become possible. To this end utilizing automated liquid-handling techniques\ncapable of dispensing droplet quantities, chemists are now able to\nconduct analog syntheses in a 1536-well-plate format either with or\nwithout purification allowing a rapid and systematic evaluation of\nchemical space while minimizing solvent use (conducting 1536 reactions\neach in 1.2 μL of solvent uses less than 2 mL in total). This\nrepresents a seismic shift in the volumes of solvents utilized during\nan SAR campaign if the chemistries for each discrete analog are performed\non a nanoscale. A robust partnership and coordination between analytical\ncharacterization and biological assay\ndevelopment is critical for success with this approach.\n\nScreen\nto be Green – the application\nof material-sparing approaches to HTE within medicinal chemistry programs\nenables the rapid evaluation to identify potentially greener reaction\nconditions for a specific transformation of interest. For example,\nthe legacy data from J. Med. Chem. suggest that amide-bond\nformation is best conducted in either DMF or DCM as the reaction solvent.\nUtilizing a 96-well plate format allows the experimentalist to assay\nthe viability of this reaction in a range of other solvents in a highly\nexpeditious manner. Furthermore, an HTE-based approach to reaction\ndevelopment allows secondary- and ternary-interactions between reactants/catalysts/additives\nand solvents to be easily detected, thus leading to a more robust\nunderstanding of a reaction mechanism.\nGreen Solvents are Ideal for Miniaturization –\none of the key technical challenges presented by miniaturization\nof chemistries involves the handling/dispensing of small volumes of\nliquids reproducibly and accurately. HTE augmented by automation and\nliquid-handling favors solvents with high viscosities such as DMSO. Polar aprotic solvents such as this exhibit\nhigh boiling points, are ideal for the effective solubilization of\nsubstrates and reagents, and are highly compatible with a diverse\nrange of plastics. This is in alignment with the Green Principle of\n“Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries” and furthermore reactions\nrun in DMSO can be utilized directly in principle in various biological\nassays provided upfront validation work is carried out.\n\nMinimizing\nHazards – in addition\nto the identity of solvent selection in relation to reaction miniaturization,\nthe intrinsic value of using smaller quantities of hazardous reagents\nis attractive and aligns with the Green Principle of “Less\nHazardous Chemical Synthesis”.\n\nRunaway Reactions –\nwhile on\ntypical medicinal chemistry scales (milligrams), the likelihood of\nuncontrolled reactions is typically low, miniaturization further reduces\nthe possibility of hazardous processes. Coupled with the preference for high-boiling polar solvents and\nthe favored practice of working under an inert atmosphere (glovebox),\noperator safety is high mapping onto the principle of “Inherently\nSafer Chemistry for Accident Prevention”. In addition, the\nuse of a glovebox assists in the mitigation of waste enabling the\npreparation, storage, and long-term use of stock solutions of potentially\nair- and moisture-sensitive reagents such as phosphine ligands.\n\nGreen\nby Design – the aforementioned\nexamples of HTE applied to parallel reaction optimization and parallel\nsynthesis should enable more rapid decision-making and minimize design-make-test\ncycles. In addition, vast quantities of data are generated during\nsuch endeavors, and through the application of cheminformatics tools\ncoupled with the advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence,\nthe Green Principle of “Prevention” can be realized. We have already seen how HTE can reduce the\nneed to repeat experiments through investing upfront, while in combinatorial\ndesigns, the use of predicted properties to enhance the “drug-likeness”\nof designs means selecting compounds with a higher probability of\nprogressing through a project testing cascade thus eliminating the unnecessary synthesis of compounds\nwith undesirable properties. Rapid Optimization Increases the Probability\nof Success for Parallel Synthesis\n – consider running an array of compounds under suboptimal\nconditions in which only 20% of reactions lead to the desired product.\nFor example, if there are 24 reactions (1 mL solvent each), with a\n20% success rate, only 5 analogs will be successfully obtained. Furthermore,\none strategy that is often adopted for poor-performing reactions is\nto increase the scale to ensure that “some” product\nis obtained leading to additional solvent use as well as potentially\nlaborious purification sequences. If, for example, a quick optimization\nis carried out using preplated catalysts, and the success rate were to be enhanced to 80%, 19 analogs will\nbe registered. To illustrate this as an estimate, Scenario A translates\nto 100 mL of solvent and uses 3.24 g of advanced intermediate (or\ntemplate), whereas Scenario B requires only ∼25 mL of solvent\nwhile now using 984 mg of compound. Further benefits are also realized\nwith reduced cycle time as well as reductions\nin waste generated owing to less starting template being used (e.g.,\ndiscarded nitrile gloves, test tubes, syringes, purification solvents,\nreaction workup waste) (Figure \n). Less is More.\nPushing the Boundary to Nanoscale\nSynthesis – there has long been a disconnect within\nmedicinal chemistry between the amount of compound synthesized compared\nto the amount of material needed for an initial biochemical assay,\nthough with additional recent advances, conducting reactions on vanishingly\nsmall quantities (0.05 mg) has become possible. To this end utilizing automated liquid-handling techniques\ncapable of dispensing droplet quantities, chemists are now able to\nconduct analog syntheses in a 1536-well-plate format either with or\nwithout purification allowing a rapid and systematic evaluation of\nchemical space while minimizing solvent use (conducting 1536 reactions\neach in 1.2 μL of solvent uses less than 2 mL in total). This\nrepresents a seismic shift in the volumes of solvents utilized during\nan SAR campaign if the chemistries for each discrete analog are performed\non a nanoscale. A robust partnership and coordination between analytical\ncharacterization and biological assay\ndevelopment is critical for success with this approach. Screen\nto be Green – the application\nof material-sparing approaches to HTE within medicinal chemistry programs\nenables the rapid evaluation to identify potentially greener reaction\nconditions for a specific transformation of interest. For example,\nthe legacy data from J. Med. Chem. suggest that amide-bond\nformation is best conducted in either DMF or DCM as the reaction solvent.\nUtilizing a 96-well plate format allows the experimentalist to assay\nthe viability of this reaction in a range of other solvents in a highly\nexpeditious manner. Furthermore, an HTE-based approach to reaction\ndevelopment allows secondary- and ternary-interactions between reactants/catalysts/additives\nand solvents to be easily detected, thus leading to a more robust\nunderstanding of a reaction mechanism. Green Solvents are Ideal for Miniaturization –\none of the key technical challenges presented by miniaturization\nof chemistries involves the handling/dispensing of small volumes of\nliquids reproducibly and accurately. HTE augmented by automation and\nliquid-handling favors solvents with high viscosities such as DMSO. Polar aprotic solvents such as this exhibit\nhigh boiling points, are ideal for the effective solubilization of\nsubstrates and reagents, and are highly compatible with a diverse\nrange of plastics. This is in alignment with the Green Principle of\n“Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries” and furthermore reactions\nrun in DMSO can be utilized directly in principle in various biological\nassays provided upfront validation work is carried out. Minimizing\nHazards – in addition\nto the identity of solvent selection in relation to reaction miniaturization,\nthe intrinsic value of using smaller quantities of hazardous reagents\nis attractive and aligns with the Green Principle of “Less\nHazardous Chemical Synthesis”. Runaway Reactions –\nwhile on\ntypical medicinal chemistry scales (milligrams), the likelihood of\nuncontrolled reactions is typically low, miniaturization further reduces\nthe possibility of hazardous processes. Coupled with the preference for high-boiling polar solvents and\nthe favored practice of working under an inert atmosphere (glovebox),\noperator safety is high mapping onto the principle of “Inherently\nSafer Chemistry for Accident Prevention”. In addition, the\nuse of a glovebox assists in the mitigation of waste enabling the\npreparation, storage, and long-term use of stock solutions of potentially\nair- and moisture-sensitive reagents such as phosphine ligands. Green\nby Design – the aforementioned\nexamples of HTE applied to parallel reaction optimization and parallel\nsynthesis should enable more rapid decision-making and minimize design-make-test\ncycles. In addition, vast quantities of data are generated during\nsuch endeavors, and through the application of cheminformatics tools\ncoupled with the advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence,\nthe Green Principle of “Prevention” can be realized. We have already seen how HTE can reduce the\nneed to repeat experiments through investing upfront, while in combinatorial\ndesigns, the use of predicted properties to enhance the “drug-likeness”\nof designs means selecting compounds with a higher probability of\nprogressing through a project testing cascade thus eliminating the unnecessary synthesis of compounds\nwith undesirable properties. To summarize, miniaturization and HTE offer an orthogonal\napproach\nto reducing solvent usage and therefore contribute to the overall\nsustainability of our industry. And while these tools provide medicinal\nchemists with many opportunities to increase efficiencies while reducing\nwaste, an existing challenge most notably for HTE is with relation\nto waste consumables (plastic plates/glass vials), where application\nof the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle could further supplement\nprogress toward sustainable discovery chemistry.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Medicinal Chemistry Focus team of ACS-GCIPR\nhas conducted a\nsystematic survey of the most common synthetic transformations that\nhave been carried out within the drug discovery phase over the past\ntwo decades. While these reactions are often performed on a relatively\nsmall scale (milligrams to grams), the amount of solvent utilized\nand waste generated is significant given that over 400k reactions\nare profiled here. The data clearly indicate that the use of unsustainable/hazardous\nsolvents is prevalent within the medicinal chemistry community with\nover 40% of the reactions being performed in undesirable chlorinated,\ndipolar aprotic, ethereal, or hydrocarbon-based solvents with two\ntransformations (including amide-bond formation, which is the most\nprevalent) using unsustainable solvents in over 70% of the instances\nsurveyed. The survey also examined the common methods and media utilized\nfor purification and workup of these transformations and again highlights\nthat most notably methylene chloride is still extensively used in\nboth chromatography and extractive separations. This manuscript\nprovides guidance on resources for the proactive\nselection of suitable reaction solvents as well as details regarding\nsolvent guides, which highlight suitable replacement of reaction media\nas well as information around emerging “greener” solvents.\nIn addition, alternative protocols for the ten most encountered synthetic\ntransformations currently in medicinal chemistry laboratories are\nalso reported. Finally, the utility of both High-Throughput Experimentation\n(HTE) and the emergence of AI/ML techniques for making more judicious\nselections of reaction conditions are also reported. The use of solvents\nas a whole within Synthetic Organic Chemistry represents a major dichotomy\nwith regard to Green Chemistry, and while it is acknowledged that\nit is highly challenging given their critical roles to eliminate a\nsolvent (though “safe” minimization is highly encouraged),\nmaking better choices in terms of selecting a reaction medium will\nhave a major impact on the overall sustainability of not only a specific\nreaction but also the drug discovery process in our industry as a\nwhole. However, it is important to put the overall guidance from this\narticle in perspective in that herein we consider only the usage phase\nof a solvent’s life cycle. While obviously this is a focal\npoint for the practicing medicinal chemist, from a big-picture sustainability\nperspective for the global chemical enterprise, it is an absolute\npriority that the full life cycle of a solvent, including its manufacture,\nshould be taken into account when one seeks to describe it as a “green”\nsolvent.\n\n## Significance\nSignificance: We analyze\nreactions reported from Medicinal\nChemistry laboratories over the past 20 years and report on the trends\nsurrounding the nature of the organic solvents used to perform these\ntransformations. Impact: The data clearly demonstrate\nthat ∼50% of the reactions analyzed are run in hazardous, unsustainable\nsolvents. Innovation: A broad range of strategies is\ndescribed, including solvent selection guides/tools, alternative reaction\nconditions, and experimental approaches to enable more judicious solvent\nselections to be made.",
