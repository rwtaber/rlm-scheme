  "abstract": "While the immunomodulation\neffects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl\nsubstances (PFASs) are described on the level of clinical signs in\nepidemiological studies (e.g., suppressed antibody response after\nvaccination), the underlying mechanism has still not been fully elucidated.\nTo reveal mechanisms of PFAS exposure on immunity, we investigated\nthe genome-wide transcriptomic changes of peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells (PBMCs) responding to PFAS exposure (specifically, exposure\nto PFPA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS). Blood samples\nand the chemical load in the blood were analyzed under the cross-sectional\nCELSPAC: Young Adults study. The overall aim of the study was to identify\nsensitive gene sets and cellular pathways conserved for multiple PFAS\nchemicals. Transcriptome networks related to adaptive immunity were\nperturbed by multiple PFAS exposure (i.e., blood levels of at least\nfour PFASs). Specifically, processes tightly connected with late B\ncell development, such as B cell receptor signaling, germinal center\nreactions, and plasma cell development, were shown to be affected.\nOur comprehensive transcriptome analysis identified the disruption\nof B cell development, specifically the impact on the maturation of\nantibody-secreting cells, as a potential mechanism underlying PFAS\nimmunotoxicity.",

      "text": "Per-\nand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are emerging environmental\ncontaminants that have been used since the 1940s. PFASs, due to their\nsurfactant properties and chemical stability, have found many applications\nin industry as well as in the consumer sector. 1  Due to their high stability, PFASs persist in the environment and\nthus can be found in water, soil, and air. Therefore, people and other\nliving organisms are continuously exposed to these chemicals. 2  Alarmingly, PFASs have been found in human matrices\nwith high frequency. The United States of America (U.S.A.) and European\nepidemiological and biomonitoring studies report that PFASs are present\nin human blood, often with a detection frequency above 90%. 3 , 4\n\nPFAS exposure has been associated with adverse health outcomes,\nsuch as liver damage, endocrine disruption, liver and testicular cancer,\nand immune disruption. 5  Suppressed antibody\nresponse after vaccination is one of the frequently described effects\nof the immune disruption associated with PFASs. 6 , 7  Further,\nPFAS exposure has been associated with an increased risk of infectious\ndiseases, the prevalence of asthma, and altered immunological responses\nin allergies. 7  Taken together, it is evident\nthat PFASs are immunomodulatory stressors; however, the mechanism\nof action has still not been fully elucidated, specifically in humans.\n\nA number of epidemiological studies have indicated that PFASs interfere\nwith antibody production. Experimental studies reviewed recently by\nEhrlich et al. in 2023 suggest the involvement of nuclear receptors,\nsuch as NF-κB and PPARs, and/or calcium signaling. 8  Data from both epidemiological and toxicological\nstudies are valuable for determining adverse outcome pathways (AOPs),\ni.e., the set of casually linked events leading from the initial molecular\nevent to the apical health effect. Especially, the identification\nand quantification of biomarkers of effect provide valuable data for\nbuilding AOPs. 9  By implementing omics and\nadvanced bioinformatics, biomarkers of effect on biological levels\nsuch as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome can be\nrevealed. These omics technologies are useful for characterizing the\neffect of PFASs on human health and, most importantly, revealing an\nearly event that may lead to adverse health effects. 10 , 11  Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of immune blood cells, for example,\ncan uncover valuable information about complex immune signaling. This\ntechnique allows researchers to analyze the complete set of ribonucleic\nacid (RNA) transcripts present in cells, providing valuable insights\ninto the gene expression patterns underlying immune responses. Genome-wide\ntranscriptomic studies are prevalently performed on samples from in\nvitro studies and animal in vivo studies. Transcriptomic analyses\nof samples from epidemiological studies are scarce despite their outputs\nbeing valuable, as they can demonstrate the transcriptomic activity\nof cells in living human organisms. By employing transcriptomic techniques,\nwe can quantify the specific transcripts and molecular pathways involved\nin immunity, offering a comprehensive view of the immune system’s\ndynamics. 12  This approach enables the characterization\nof immune cells and their interactions in response to various stimuli,\nincluding pathogens, toxins, and (most importantly) environmental\nfactors, and therefore provides evidence about potential biomarkers\nof effect.\n\nHowever, a biomarker of effect that can be identified\nin a study\nfocusing on a particular outcome does not have to be considered the\nonly one because chemical compounds can have multiple modes of action\nand mechanisms to affect human health. Nevertheless, these single\nstudies that identify biomarkers are important, as they can be later\ncompared to other similar studies in a focused meta-analysis and the\nmost relevant mechanism can be identified. Further, because PFASs\nare a group of compounds that are structurally alike, we hypothesize\nthat there could be a conserved mechanism of action for multiple PFASs,\nwhich can be elucidated by capturing the biomarker of effect.\n\nTherefore, the objective of this study was to identify a transcriptomic\nresponse that is conserved for multiple PFASs, including the seven\nmost abundant ones: perfluoropentanoate (PFPA), perfluorooctanoate\n(PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoate\n(PFUnDA), pefluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorooctanesulfonate\n(PFOS). To reach this aim, the gene expression profiles within human\nimmune cells in relation to PFAS blood levels from a cross-sectional\nCzech adult cohort study were researched. Using this approach, we\naimed to uncover the molecular responses underlying PFAS-associated\nimmunomodulation in humans. Through the utilization of transcriptomics,\nour research endeavors shed light on the specific gene expression\npatterns, molecular pathways, and regulatory mechanisms involved in\nthe immune system’s response to PFAS exposure."

Detailed\ninformation about the ELSPAC-CZ study is provided in ref ( 13 ). The CELSPAC: YA study\ncollected a broad spectrum of data, including lifestyle and health\nquestionnaires, blood and urine samples, and chemical analysis of\nblood.

The PBMC fraction was suspended in RNAprotect Cell Reagent\nand frozen (−80 °C) in 300 μL aliquots containing\n∼13 million cells until use for analysis (not longer than 3\nyears). The RNA was then extracted from the PBMCs in the RNAprotect\nCell Reagent with the Zymo Research Quick-RNA Whole Blood (R1201)\nextraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nQuality parameters such as the concentration, purity (NanoDrop, Thermo\nFisher Scientific), and integrity (5200 Fragment Analyzer system,\nAgilent) of the extracted RNA were determined. For library preparation\nand sequencing, 1 μg of high-quality RNA per sample was used.\nThe mean RNA integrity number (RIN) for the samples was 9.0 (min–max:\n7.3–10.0).\n\nGenome-wide analysis of gene expression was conducted\nusing a next-generation\nsequencing (NGS) platform with the QuantSeq library preparation step.\ncDNA libraries for each sample (RNA) were generated from 1 μg\nof the total RNA using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq library prep\nkit for Illumina (Lexogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nQuantSeq generates highly strand-specific NGS libraries close to the\n3′ end of poly-A RNA. 15  Standard\nexternal barcodes were ligated to allow multiplex sequencing.

      "text": "Our analysis identified 166 genes\nthat were significantly ( p  < 0.05) associated\nwith exposure to at least four of the seven examined PFASs (PFPA,\nPFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS;  Figure S2 ). However, no genes were significantly associated when the\nmore stringent statistical analysis (FDR correction) was applied.\nThe analysis did not identify a single gene associated with all seven\nPFASs. However, 10 out of the 166 genes were associated with the levels\nof six PFASs, and 44 genes were associated with five PFASs. It is\nworth noting that, apart from PFPA, all of the other PFASs (PFOA,\nPFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS) demonstrated a congruent direction\nof effect for individual genes, either the downregulation or the upregulation\nof gene expression ( Figure S2 ). This trend\nis visible when looking at the same color in each row in  Figure S2 : red indicates the upregulation of\ngene expression, and blue indicates the downregulation of gene expression.\nThis overall trend revealed a contrasting relationship between PFPA\nexposure and gene expression compared to the other PFASs, as the associations\nexhibit opposite directions. Further, compared to the other PFASs,\nPFPA had only a few statistically significant ( p  <\n0.05) associations ( Table S3 ).\n\nPFPA\nstands out among other PFAS compounds due to its shorter perfluorinated\ncarbon chain comprising only four fluorinated carbons and due to it\nbeing the only short-chain PFAS. In contrast to the other long-chain\nPFAS compounds analyzed in this study, this disparity in carbon chain\nlength grants PFPA distinctive chemical properties and attributes. 25  Consequently, this variation could potentially\nresult in distinct biological effects. Chain-length-dependent biological\nactivity has been shown in in vivo studies (e.g., mice, rats, and\nmarine mussel models). 26 − 28  In a study with mice, Lee and Kim suggested that\nthe length of the perfluorinated chain determines the effect, as they\nobserved increased NF-κB activity in the case of longer PFASs\n(C10 and C11) and no NF-κB activity in the case of shorter PFASs\n(C7 and C9). Similarly, Stevenson et al. observed a chain-length-specific\ninteraction between PFASs and efflux transporters, a multixenobiotic\nresistance mechanism that triggered the exporting chemicals from cells. 27  Further, a study with rats showed distinct toxicokinetic\nproperties for PFASs with different carbon chain lengths; specifically,\nthere was a high clearance rate for PFASs with shorter carbon chain\nlengths. 28  Different chemical–physical\nproperties, i.e., differences in lipophobic/hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl\ntails, can thus trigger both the fate of the chemicals in the organisms\nand the biological activity. It is important to note that specific\nstudies and research are needed to comprehensively evaluate and determine\nthe precise biological effects of PFPA compared to those of other\nPFAS compounds.\n\nFour cell processes\nwere identified by SNEA as being enriched ( Table  1  and  Figure  1 ): germinal center B cell differentiation, germinal\ncenter formation, the B cell receptor signaling pathway, and plasma\ncell differentiation. These enriched processes suggest that PFASs\ntarget B cell development, especially late B cell development (impaired\nprocesses are visualized in  Figure  1 ).\n\nB cell development. Processes in red frames\nwere enriched by genes\nassociated with multiple PFAS exposure (i.e., with at least four PFASs;\nsee  Table  1 ). B cells\ndevelop in bone marrow, where their B cell receptors (BCRs) undergo\nsomatic recombination, resulting in high variability in the BCR specificity\n(for a particular antigen) of individual B cells. These immature B\ncells enter the bloodstream and migrate to secondary lymphoid organs\n(e.g., the spleen and lymphoid nodes), where they become activated\nand create germinal centers. In a germinal center, a B cell undergoes\nsomatic hypermutation, selection, and class-switch recombination,\nand it becomes either a memory cell or a plasma cell, whereas the\nlatter is crucial for antibody production.\n\nGenes overlapping within significant cell processes (i.e., those\nlisted in  Table  1 )\nare shown in  Table  2 . These include the genes coding transcription factors E2A, E2-2,\nEBF1, OCT-2, and SPI-B, further the transmembrane molecule CD19, and\nthe histone demethylase LSD1, all of which are significantly involved\nin B cell development, including germinal center (GC) reactions. GCs\nplay a crucial role in the formation and maturation of plasma cells,\nwhich are a type of B cells that are responsible for producing antibodies.\n\nResults are expressed as β\ncoefficients produced by linear regression. Statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) are marked in bold with *. PFPA = perfluoropentanoate,\nPFOA = perfluorooctanoate, PFNA = perfluorononanoate, PFDA = perfluorodecanoate,\nPFUnDA = perfluoroundecanoate, PFHxS = pefluorohexane sulfonate, and\nPFOS = perfluorooctane sulfonate.\n\nThe transcription factors E2A (encoded by the  TCF3  gene) and E2-2 (encoded by the  TCF4  gene) belong\nto a group of E-proteins, and together, they cooperate to regulate\nB cell immunity, especially late B cell development. Both play a crucial\nrole in controlling GC and plasma cell development. While E2A has\nbeen shown to be a dominant E-protein in GC B cell differentiation,\nE2-2 plays a dominant role in plasma cell development. 29\n\nAnother transcription factor, which often\ncooperates with E2A,\nis early B cell factor EBF1. As its name indicates, EBF1 plays a key\nrole in the early stages of B cell development, specifically in the\npro-B cell stage. Additionally, EBF1 is known to play an important\nrole in GC formation. 30 , 31  Specifically, EBF1 has been shown\nto interact with PAX5, one of the crucial players in B cell differentiation,\nand together, they regulate the transcription of many genes during\nB cell development. The cooperation of these two transcription factors\nallows the expression of molecules such as CD19 and CD79b, which are\nimportant players in B cell signaling. 32\n\nCD19, besides being a unique characterization surface marker\nof\nB cells, has an indispensable functional role. CD19 modulates both\nBCR-dependent and BCR-independent signaling. 33  Specifically, CD19 often functions with CD21 (which is activated\nby binding of the antigen-C3d complex), CD81 (TAPA-1), and CD225 to\ncomprise a multimolecular complex that can transduce signals in both\na BCR-dependent and BCR-independent fashion. CD19 is a transmembrane\nprotein transducing signal to downstream protein kinases such as Lyn,\nFyn (Src family), Abl, Btk, PI3K, and Ras family kinases. 33 , 34  Further, CD19 is also required for optimal MHC class II-mediated\nsignaling through Akt kinase. 35\n\nOCT-2,\nencoded by the  POU2F2  gene, is a transcription\nfactor that is indispensable for GC formation. OCT-2 action is accompanied\nby the OBF1 coactivator, which stabilizes the binding of OCT-2 to\nchromatin. 36 , 37  Interestingly, these two factors\n(OCT2 and OBF1) are essential for the proliferation and survival of\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma. 37 , 38\n\nSPI-B is a transcription\nfactor that represses B cell differentiation. 39  However, SPI-B together with PU.1 (encoded by\nthe  SPI1  gene) is essential for signaling through\nBCR and through receptors for CD40L, BAFF, and TLR ligands. 40\n\nLSD1, encoded by  KDM1A , is a histone demethylase\nthat can regulate gene expression. It interacts with Blimp-1, which\nis an essential transcription factor for plasma cell differentiation. 41  On the basis of LSD1-deficient mice, LSD1 has\nbeen shown to be a crucial epigenetic modifier in plasma cell development\nby regulating chromatin accessibility. 41\n\nOverall, SNEA revealed four statistically significant cell\nprocesses\nthat were all related to B cells, specifically to GC reactions. Further,\ngenes abundantly present in these cell processes were negatively associated\nwith PFAS exposure except for PFPA. Such a negative association between\nthe genes and PFAS exposure indicates the downregulation of these\ngenes ( Table  2 ) and\ntheir respective cell processes ( Table  1 ). This finding is in line with epidemiological studies\nconnecting PFAS exposure to decreased antibody production, as GCs\nand plasma cells are crucial for antibody response.\n\nIn total, 126 entities\nwere significantly enriched by genes associated with multiple PFAS\nexposure by GSEA ( Table S4 ). GSEA provides\ndetailed information about enriched entities on levels such as biomarkers,\nsignal processing, biological processes, and diseases. The majority\nof the enriched entities were related to immunity terms, but there\nwere also non-immune terms and general biological processes. Enriched\nimmune-related entities included terms related to both innate and\nadaptive immunity. A prevalent motif within adaptive immunity terms\nis B cell activation and development, which corresponds to the results\nproduced by SNEA ( Table  2 ). The identified B cell-related entities were clustered into four\nmain domains: B cell receptor signaling, TLR signaling, T cell–B\ncell interaction, and E2A signaling ( Table  3 ).\n\nB cell receptor (BCR) signaling is crucial for B cell\nactivation\nand, therefore, for the subsequent creation of GCs. BCR signaling\nis very complex, as BCR cooperates with many other receptors and has\nseveral downstream intracellular signaling pathways 42  ( Table  3 , B cell receptor signaling cluster). Specifically, BCR can activate\nNFAT signaling downstream. 43  Even though\nNFAT signaling was discovered in T cells, it was later revealed that\nthis signaling pathway is essential for normal B cell homeostasis\nand differentiation. 44  Further, BCR signaling\ncan lead to the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB\nand AP-1, which are highly involved in regulating immune response. 43 , 45  Moreover, B cells at all stages (except plasma cells) express the\nCD72 molecule, which is a coreceptor that regulates BCR signaling. 46  In addition to BCRs, B cells express toll-like\nreceptors (TLRs), which play an important role in B cell activation.\nTLR signaling can therefore enhance the signal for B cell activation,\nand it is important for B cell differentiation in plasma cells. 47\n\nWhen a GC is formed, T follicular helper\ncells play an important\nrole in the coactivation of B cells, which is crucial for their future\ndifferentiation into plasma cells ( Table  3 , T cell–B cell interaction cluster).\nThis coactivation is ensured by a T cell receptor recognizing the\nantigen on the MHC class-II molecule expressed by a B cell, and further\nby the CD40L of the T cell binding to the CD40 receptor of the B cell\n( Figure  1 ). 42 , 48 − 50\n\nAs stated above, the  TCF3  gene\ncodes the transcription\nfactor E2A, which is essential for GC B cell differentiation ( Table  3 , E2A signaling cluster).\nNevertheless, the E2A function is regulated by other players, one\nof these being Notch proteins. 51  Notch\nproteins regulate whole B cell development, including plasma cell\ndifferentiation. 52  The importance of E2A\nin B cell development is also demonstrated by the fact that the disruption\nof the E2A function contributes to the progression of Hodgkin lymphoma. 53 , 54  Hodgkin lymphoma is a B cell-derived cancer and is characterized\nby the presence of Reed–Sternberg cells and Hodgkin cells. 55\n\nThe overall GSEA results indicate that\nmultiple PFAS exposure affects\npathways and genes of adaptive immunity; however, general entities\n(pathways and biomarkers) that play a role in the entire immune system,\nincluding innate immunity, were also identified. Within entities of\nadaptive immunity, processes involved in B cell activation, development,\nand differentiation were abundantly included, which is in line with\nthe results of SNEA. However, the results of GSEA indicate that PFAS\nexposure may also affect other processes within the entire immune\nsystem, demonstrating the complexity of PFAS immunomodulation.\n\nTaken together, the results of the current\nstudy indicate that multiple PFAS exposure influences the immune system\nin the phase of late B cell development, specifically B cell activation,\nGC reactions, and plasma cell development. As GCs and plasma cells\nare essential for antibody production, the findings of the current\nstudy are in line with suppressed antibody responses after vaccination\nassociated with PFAS exposure, which has been largely reported in\nthe literature. 6 , 56 − 60  Similarly, a recent in vivo study on mice showed\na decreased level of antibodies accompanied by a decreased number\nof splenic B cells, including plasma cells, due to PFOA exposure. 61  Further, the affected development of plasma\ncells, i.e., antibody-secreting cells, that was observed in our study\ncould be the underlying mechanism for the altered prevalence of allergic\ndiseases, as the IgE antibodies are the main effector agent in allergic\ndiseases. 62  Interestingly, PFAS exposure\nwas associated with both the increased 63 , 64  and decreased 14 , 65  prevalence of allergic diseases. This evidence indicates that the\neffects of PFAS exposure are complex and complicated, especially when\nwe are assessing exposure to a mixture of them, as different PFASs\ncan act differently, as was also shown in our study with the example\nof PFPA.\n\nDespite the fact that transcriptomic data from epidemiological\nstudies are highly valuable, there is a scarce number of them. Similar\nto our study, the effect of PFAS exposure on adaptive immunity, specifically\nthe deregulation of T cell signaling, was observed in a Norwegian\nBraMat human cohort study investigating transcriptomic profiles in\nneonatal cord blood. 66  Although both studies\nfocused on immunotoxicity, their design and samples differed. Because\nthe Norwegian study focused on the genes common for PFAS exposure\nand anti-rubella antibody levels at 3 years of age, the genes common\nfor PFAS exposure, and a number of common cold episodes until 3 years\nof age, the results are not directly comparable to the those of this\ncurrent study. Interestingly, a large cross-species transcriptomics\nanalysis, which included human samples, identified the neutrophil\ntertiary granule mechanism as being strongly conserved among species\nand proposed it as a potential mechanism underlying PFAS immunotoxicity.\nNeutrophils are the most abundant cells of innate immunity and are\nevolutionarily more conserved through different species compared to\nB cell signaling and other adaptive immunity processes. A strong pattern\nrelated to neutrophils was not shown in our study, as our analysis\nwas based on the transcriptome of PBMCs that do not contain neutrophils.\nEven though a PBMC sample does not contain all of the immune cells\nin the same ratio as in a living organism (innate immune cells in\nparticular are not represented in full numbers), PBMCs are considered\na valuable matrix for transcriptomic analysis. 67\n\nThe detailed mechanism behind PFAS immunotoxicity\nis still not\nfully understood. We described for the first time the alteration in\nB cell development as a potential mode of action on human samples.\nAmong others, we identified NF-κB and NFAT signaling, which\nhave already been described as being associated with PFAS exposure. 8  In both human and animal studies, the association\nof PFAS exposure with a disbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines has been observed. 8  However, the evidence of this imbalance is inconsistent\nbetween published studies and is thus inconclusive. Nevertheless,\na disbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines could further affect B cell development\nin stages such as B cell activation, GC formation, antibody-secreting\nplasma cell development, or memory B cells differentiation.\n\nIn conclusion, the utilization of genome-wide sequencing in this\nstudy revealed that BCR signaling, GC reactions, and the development\nof plasma cells could be behind the potential mechanisms underlying\nPFAS immunotoxicity. Future research should be conducted on B cell\ndevelopment and germinal centers as the target for PFASs to verify\nthe results of the current study, preferably using controlled toxicological\nexperiments. A further relevant avenue that needs to be explored is\ndetermining the long-term effects of PFAS exposure on immune function\nand potential immunological memory and/or examining the broader consequences\nof PFAS-induced immunotoxicity on the overall immune response, including\nthe susceptibility to infections, allergies, autoimmune diseases,\nand impaired vaccine responses. We believe that such further investigations\nmay enhance our understanding of immunotoxicity not only for currently\nused PFASs but also prospectively for their chemically similar alternatives."

      "title": "Gene Expression Significantly\nAssociated with\nMultiple PFAS Exposure",
      "text": "Our analysis identified 166 genes\nthat were significantly ( p  < 0.05) associated\nwith exposure to at least four of the seven examined PFASs (PFPA,\nPFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS;  Figure S2 ). However, no genes were significantly associated when the\nmore stringent statistical analysis (FDR correction) was applied.\nThe analysis did not identify a single gene associated with all seven\nPFASs. However, 10 out of the 166 genes were associated with the levels\nof six PFASs, and 44 genes were associated with five PFASs. It is\nworth noting that, apart from PFPA, all of the other PFASs (PFOA,\nPFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS) demonstrated a congruent direction\nof effect for individual genes, either the downregulation or the upregulation\nof gene expression ( Figure S2 ). This trend\nis visible when looking at the same color in each row in  Figure S2 : red indicates the upregulation of\ngene expression, and blue indicates the downregulation of gene expression.\nThis overall trend revealed a contrasting relationship between PFPA\nexposure and gene expression compared to the other PFASs, as the associations\nexhibit opposite directions. Further, compared to the other PFASs,\nPFPA had only a few statistically significant ( p  <\n0.05) associations ( Table S3 ).\n\nPFPA\nstands out among other PFAS compounds due to its shorter perfluorinated\ncarbon chain comprising only four fluorinated carbons and due to it\nbeing the only short-chain PFAS. In contrast to the other long-chain\nPFAS compounds analyzed in this study, this disparity in carbon chain\nlength grants PFPA distinctive chemical properties and attributes. 25  Consequently, this variation could potentially\nresult in distinct biological effects. Chain-length-dependent biological\nactivity has been shown in in vivo studies (e.g., mice, rats, and\nmarine mussel models). 26 − 28  In a study with mice, Lee and Kim suggested that\nthe length of the perfluorinated chain determines the effect, as they\nobserved increased NF-κB activity in the case of longer PFASs\n(C10 and C11) and no NF-κB activity in the case of shorter PFASs\n(C7 and C9). Similarly, Stevenson et al. observed a chain-length-specific\ninteraction between PFASs and efflux transporters, a multixenobiotic\nresistance mechanism that triggered the exporting chemicals from cells. 27  Further, a study with rats showed distinct toxicokinetic\nproperties for PFASs with different carbon chain lengths; specifically,\nthere was a high clearance rate for PFASs with shorter carbon chain\nlengths. 28  Different chemical–physical\nproperties, i.e., differences in lipophobic/hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl\ntails, can thus trigger both the fate of the chemicals in the organisms\nand the biological activity. It is important to note that specific\nstudies and research are needed to comprehensively evaluate and determine\nthe precise biological effects of PFPA compared to those of other\nPFAS compounds."

      "text": "Four cell processes\nwere identified by SNEA as being enriched ( Table  1  and  Figure  1 ): germinal center B cell differentiation, germinal\ncenter formation, the B cell receptor signaling pathway, and plasma\ncell differentiation. These enriched processes suggest that PFASs\ntarget B cell development, especially late B cell development (impaired\nprocesses are visualized in  Figure  1 ).\n\nB cell development. Processes in red frames\nwere enriched by genes\nassociated with multiple PFAS exposure (i.e., with at least four PFASs;\nsee  Table  1 ). B cells\ndevelop in bone marrow, where their B cell receptors (BCRs) undergo\nsomatic recombination, resulting in high variability in the BCR specificity\n(for a particular antigen) of individual B cells. These immature B\ncells enter the bloodstream and migrate to secondary lymphoid organs\n(e.g., the spleen and lymphoid nodes), where they become activated\nand create germinal centers. In a germinal center, a B cell undergoes\nsomatic hypermutation, selection, and class-switch recombination,\nand it becomes either a memory cell or a plasma cell, whereas the\nlatter is crucial for antibody production.\n\nGenes overlapping within significant cell processes (i.e., those\nlisted in  Table  1 )\nare shown in  Table  2 . These include the genes coding transcription factors E2A, E2-2,\nEBF1, OCT-2, and SPI-B, further the transmembrane molecule CD19, and\nthe histone demethylase LSD1, all of which are significantly involved\nin B cell development, including germinal center (GC) reactions. GCs\nplay a crucial role in the formation and maturation of plasma cells,\nwhich are a type of B cells that are responsible for producing antibodies.\n\nResults are expressed as β\ncoefficients produced by linear regression. Statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) are marked in bold with *. PFPA = perfluoropentanoate,\nPFOA = perfluorooctanoate, PFNA = perfluorononanoate, PFDA = perfluorodecanoate,\nPFUnDA = perfluoroundecanoate, PFHxS = pefluorohexane sulfonate, and\nPFOS = perfluorooctane sulfonate.\n\nThe transcription factors E2A (encoded by the  TCF3  gene) and E2-2 (encoded by the  TCF4  gene) belong\nto a group of E-proteins, and together, they cooperate to regulate\nB cell immunity, especially late B cell development. Both play a crucial\nrole in controlling GC and plasma cell development. While E2A has\nbeen shown to be a dominant E-protein in GC B cell differentiation,\nE2-2 plays a dominant role in plasma cell development. 29\n\nAnother transcription factor, which often\ncooperates with E2A,\nis early B cell factor EBF1. As its name indicates, EBF1 plays a key\nrole in the early stages of B cell development, specifically in the\npro-B cell stage. Additionally, EBF1 is known to play an important\nrole in GC formation. 30 , 31  Specifically, EBF1 has been shown\nto interact with PAX5, one of the crucial players in B cell differentiation,\nand together, they regulate the transcription of many genes during\nB cell development. The cooperation of these two transcription factors\nallows the expression of molecules such as CD19 and CD79b, which are\nimportant players in B cell signaling. 32\n\nCD19, besides being a unique characterization surface marker\nof\nB cells, has an indispensable functional role. CD19 modulates both\nBCR-dependent and BCR-independent signaling. 33  Specifically, CD19 often functions with CD21 (which is activated\nby binding of the antigen-C3d complex), CD81 (TAPA-1), and CD225 to\ncomprise a multimolecular complex that can transduce signals in both\na BCR-dependent and BCR-independent fashion.

  "full_text": "While the immunomodulation\neffects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl\nsubstances (PFASs) are described on the level of clinical signs in\nepidemiological studies (e.g., suppressed antibody response after\nvaccination), the underlying mechanism has still not been fully elucidated.\nTo reveal mechanisms of PFAS exposure on immunity, we investigated\nthe genome-wide transcriptomic changes of peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells (PBMCs) responding to PFAS exposure (specifically, exposure\nto PFPA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS). Blood samples\nand the chemical load in the blood were analyzed under the cross-sectional\nCELSPAC: Young Adults study. The overall aim of the study was to identify\nsensitive gene sets and cellular pathways conserved for multiple PFAS\nchemicals. Transcriptome networks related to adaptive immunity were\nperturbed by multiple PFAS exposure (i.e., blood levels of at least\nfour PFASs). Specifically, processes tightly connected with late B\ncell development, such as B cell receptor signaling, germinal center\nreactions, and plasma cell development, were shown to be affected.\nOur comprehensive transcriptome analysis identified the disruption\nof B cell development, specifically the impact on the maturation of\nantibody-secreting cells, as a potential mechanism underlying PFAS\nimmunotoxicity.\n\n## Introduction\n\nPer-\nand polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are emerging environmental\ncontaminants that have been used since the 1940s. PFASs, due to their\nsurfactant properties and chemical stability, have found many applications\nin industry as well as in the consumer sector. 1  Due to their high stability, PFASs persist in the environment and\nthus can be found in water, soil, and air. Therefore, people and other\nliving organisms are continuously exposed to these chemicals. 2  Alarmingly, PFASs have been found in human matrices\nwith high frequency. The United States of America (U.S.A.) and European\nepidemiological and biomonitoring studies report that PFASs are present\nin human blood, often with a detection frequency above 90%. 3 , 4\n\nPFAS exposure has been associated with adverse health outcomes,\nsuch as liver damage, endocrine disruption, liver and testicular cancer,\nand immune disruption. 5  Suppressed antibody\nresponse after vaccination is one of the frequently described effects\nof the immune disruption associated with PFASs. 6 , 7  Further,\nPFAS exposure has been associated with an increased risk of infectious\ndiseases, the prevalence of asthma, and altered immunological responses\nin allergies. 7  Taken together, it is evident\nthat PFASs are immunomodulatory stressors; however, the mechanism\nof action has still not been fully elucidated, specifically in humans.\n\nA number of epidemiological studies have indicated that PFASs interfere\nwith antibody production. Experimental studies reviewed recently by\nEhrlich et al. in 2023 suggest the involvement of nuclear receptors,\nsuch as NF-κB and PPARs, and/or calcium signaling. 8  Data from both epidemiological and toxicological\nstudies are valuable for determining adverse outcome pathways (AOPs),\ni.e., the set of casually linked events leading from the initial molecular\nevent to the apical health effect. Especially, the identification\nand quantification of biomarkers of effect provide valuable data for\nbuilding AOPs. 9  By implementing omics and\nadvanced bioinformatics, biomarkers of effect on biological levels\nsuch as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome can be\nrevealed. These omics technologies are useful for characterizing the\neffect of PFASs on human health and, most importantly, revealing an\nearly event that may lead to adverse health effects. 10 , 11  Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of immune blood cells, for example,\ncan uncover valuable information about complex immune signaling. This\ntechnique allows researchers to analyze the complete set of ribonucleic\nacid (RNA) transcripts present in cells, providing valuable insights\ninto the gene expression patterns underlying immune responses. Genome-wide\ntranscriptomic studies are prevalently performed on samples from in\nvitro studies and animal in vivo studies. Transcriptomic analyses\nof samples from epidemiological studies are scarce despite their outputs\nbeing valuable, as they can demonstrate the transcriptomic activity\nof cells in living human organisms. By employing transcriptomic techniques,\nwe can quantify the specific transcripts and molecular pathways involved\nin immunity, offering a comprehensive view of the immune system’s\ndynamics. 12  This approach enables the characterization\nof immune cells and their interactions in response to various stimuli,\nincluding pathogens, toxins, and (most importantly) environmental\nfactors, and therefore provides evidence about potential biomarkers\nof effect.\n\nHowever, a biomarker of effect that can be identified\nin a study\nfocusing on a particular outcome does not have to be considered the\nonly one because chemical compounds can have multiple modes of action\nand mechanisms to affect human health. Nevertheless, these single\nstudies that identify biomarkers are important, as they can be later\ncompared to other similar studies in a focused meta-analysis and the\nmost relevant mechanism can be identified. Further, because PFASs\nare a group of compounds that are structurally alike, we hypothesize\nthat there could be a conserved mechanism of action for multiple PFASs,\nwhich can be elucidated by capturing the biomarker of effect.\n\nTherefore, the objective of this study was to identify a transcriptomic\nresponse that is conserved for multiple PFASs, including the seven\nmost abundant ones: perfluoropentanoate (PFPA), perfluorooctanoate\n(PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoate\n(PFUnDA), pefluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorooctanesulfonate\n(PFOS). To reach this aim, the gene expression profiles within human\nimmune cells in relation to PFAS blood levels from a cross-sectional\nCzech adult cohort study were researched. Using this approach, we\naimed to uncover the molecular responses underlying PFAS-associated\nimmunomodulation in humans. Through the utilization of transcriptomics,\nour research endeavors shed light on the specific gene expression\npatterns, molecular pathways, and regulatory mechanisms involved in\nthe immune system’s response to PFAS exposure.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\nWe employed data\nfrom the cross-sectional Central European Longitudinal Studies of\nParents and Children: Young Adults (CELSPAC: YA) study, which is an\nongoing follow-up re-examination of the Czech part of the ELSPAC birth\ncohort (European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood) that\nwas initiated in 1991–1992 in the Czech Republic. Detailed\ninformation about the ELSPAC-CZ study is provided in ref ( 13 ). The CELSPAC: YA study\ncollected a broad spectrum of data, including lifestyle and health\nquestionnaires, blood and urine samples, and chemical analysis of\nblood. We examined CELSPAC: YA participants that had all of the input\ndata available for the analysis (PFAS blood levels, transcriptomic\nprofile, and questionnaire data), i.e., 288 participants, which included\na comparable number of men ( n  = 143) and women ( n  = 145). The participants that were examined were around\n27 years old (geometric mean = 27, minimum (min) = 20, and maximum\n(max) = 37) and were generally of normal weight (with a median body\nmass index (BMI) of 23.5). They prevalently had a university education\n(75%), were nonsmokers (69%), and a comparable number of them rarely\n(55%) or often (45%) consumed alcohol. The general characteristics\nof the cohort are summarized in  Table S1  in the  Supporting Information (SI) . For\nmore details about the cohort study and the collected data, see our\nprevious work. 14  The CELSPAC: YA study\nwas approved by the ELSPAC Ethics Committee (ref no. ELSPAC/EK/2/2019,\ndated March 13, 2019).\n\nBlood samples were processed and stored in a −80\n°C freezer\nwithin 4 h after collection. PFAS serum levels were measured by high-pressure\nliquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS).\nThe detailed analytical procedure has already been published in our\nprevious work. 14  In brief, 12 different\nPFASs were analyzed in serum samples: PFPA (CAS 2706-90-3), PFOA (CAS\n335-67-1), PFNA (CAS 375-95-1), PFDA (CAS 335-76-2), PFUnDA (CAS 2058-94-8),\nPFHxS (CAS 355-46-4), PFOS (CAS 1763-23-1), perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA,\nCAS 307-24-4), perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA, CAS 375-85-9), perfluorododecanoate\n(PFDoDA, CAS 307-55-1), perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS, CAS 375-73-5),\nand perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS, CAS 375-92-8). Nevertheless,\nonly PFPA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS were included\nin the investigation as the most abundant chemicals, as at least 97%\nof their values were above the limit of detection (LOD). The serum\nconcentrations of all 12 PFASs, together with their detection frequencies,\nare given in the  SI, Table S2 . A correlation\nmatrix of the seven studied PFASs is depicted in  Figure S1 .\n\nAfter the blood collection from the participants,\nthe whole blood samples (9 mL) were immediately centrifuged, and the\nbuffy coat fraction (i.e., white blood cell fraction) was separated\nby Ficoll-Paque to isolate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs). The PBMC fraction was suspended in RNAprotect Cell Reagent\nand frozen (−80 °C) in 300 μL aliquots containing\n∼13 million cells until use for analysis (not longer than 3\nyears). The RNA was then extracted from the PBMCs in the RNAprotect\nCell Reagent with the Zymo Research Quick-RNA Whole Blood (R1201)\nextraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nQuality parameters such as the concentration, purity (NanoDrop, Thermo\nFisher Scientific), and integrity (5200 Fragment Analyzer system,\nAgilent) of the extracted RNA were determined. For library preparation\nand sequencing, 1 μg of high-quality RNA per sample was used.\nThe mean RNA integrity number (RIN) for the samples was 9.0 (min–max:\n7.3–10.0).\n\nGenome-wide analysis of gene expression was conducted\nusing a next-generation\nsequencing (NGS) platform with the QuantSeq library preparation step.\ncDNA libraries for each sample (RNA) were generated from 1 μg\nof the total RNA using the QuantSeq 3′ mRNA-Seq library prep\nkit for Illumina (Lexogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nQuantSeq generates highly strand-specific NGS libraries close to the\n3′ end of poly-A RNA. 15  Standard\nexternal barcodes were ligated to allow multiplex sequencing. After\nPCR amplification, the libraries were size-selected with Agencourt\nAMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). The libraries were quantified\nby Qubit (Life Technologies), and their size (∼250 bp) was\ndetermined by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The libraries were\nsequenced (Illumina NovaSeq platform) and quality checked (110 bp\nsingle read) to obtain a minimum of 20–25 million reads per\nsample. Further, the NGS data were demultiplexed. The quality of the\nsamples was continuously checked using FastQC (0.11.5), Qualimap (11_12–16)\nand MultiQC (1.8). All of the reads were trimmed, and bad-quality\nreads were removed using BBMap (38.42). Mapping reads were done by\nSTAR (2.7.7a) using a GRCH38 human reference. Deduplication of the\nsamples was done using umi_tools (1.0.0). Transcript features were\ncounted by using htseq-count (0.11.1) and mmquant (1.3). Samtools\n(1.9) was used to manipulate the sequencing files.\n\nData were processed\nin R programming software (version 4.2.2). 16  Exposure data below the LOD or between the LOD and the limit of\nquantitation (LOQ) were imputed using LOD/   and LOQ/  , respectively.\nGenes with at least 5 CPM\n(counts per million) in at least 20% of the samples were kept to analyze.\nData were normalized using TMM (trimmed mean of  M  values) normalization and were transformed to a continuous log2\nscale using limma voom. 17 , 18  The influence of the\nbatches (i.e., the batches for RNA extraction and library preparation)\nwas checked by principal component analysis (PCA) plots and by the\ncorrelation of principal components with potential confounders. Surrogate\nvariable analysis was performed on the data, and the first 10 surrogate\nvariables were used to adjust the unknown cell blood composition. 19 − 21  Gene expression associated with individual PFASs was identified\nusing the limma lmfit model, and  p  values were corrected\nfor multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery\nrate (FDR). 22  The model was adjusted for\nbiological, socioeconomic, and technical covariates (sex, age, BMI,\neducation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and library preparation\nbatch). Genes were annotated using GeneCards. 23  The genes whose expression was associated with four or more PFASs\nwere used for subsequent enrichment analysis to uncover conserved\nPFAS effects on immunity.\n\nGene Set Enrichment\nAnalysis (GSEA) was conducted using Pathway Studio (version 12.0).\nGene sets were permutated 1000 times using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov\nclassic approach as an enrichment algorithm. To broaden the analysis,\nall pathways were expanded to include cell processes and functional\nclasses in target gene seeds. The enrichment  p  value\ncutoff was set at  p  < 0.05. Subnetwork Enrichment\nAnalysis (SNEA) was also performed as previously described. 24  The enrichment  p  value for\nthe gene seeds was set at  p  < 0.05.\n\n## Study Population\n\nWe employed data\nfrom the cross-sectional Central European Longitudinal Studies of\nParents and Children: Young Adults (CELSPAC: YA) study, which is an\nongoing follow-up re-examination of the Czech part of the ELSPAC birth\ncohort (European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood) that\nwas initiated in 1991–1992 in the Czech Republic.

Subnetwork Enrichment\nAnalysis (SNEA) was also performed as previously described. 24  The enrichment  p  value for\nthe gene seeds was set at  p  < 0.05.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nOur analysis identified 166 genes\nthat were significantly ( p  < 0.05) associated\nwith exposure to at least four of the seven examined PFASs (PFPA,\nPFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS;  Figure S2 ). However, no genes were significantly associated when the\nmore stringent statistical analysis (FDR correction) was applied.\nThe analysis did not identify a single gene associated with all seven\nPFASs. However, 10 out of the 166 genes were associated with the levels\nof six PFASs, and 44 genes were associated with five PFASs. It is\nworth noting that, apart from PFPA, all of the other PFASs (PFOA,\nPFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS) demonstrated a congruent direction\nof effect for individual genes, either the downregulation or the upregulation\nof gene expression ( Figure S2 ). This trend\nis visible when looking at the same color in each row in  Figure S2 : red indicates the upregulation of\ngene expression, and blue indicates the downregulation of gene expression.\nThis overall trend revealed a contrasting relationship between PFPA\nexposure and gene expression compared to the other PFASs, as the associations\nexhibit opposite directions. Further, compared to the other PFASs,\nPFPA had only a few statistically significant ( p  <\n0.05) associations ( Table S3 ).\n\nPFPA\nstands out among other PFAS compounds due to its shorter perfluorinated\ncarbon chain comprising only four fluorinated carbons and due to it\nbeing the only short-chain PFAS. In contrast to the other long-chain\nPFAS compounds analyzed in this study, this disparity in carbon chain\nlength grants PFPA distinctive chemical properties and attributes. 25  Consequently, this variation could potentially\nresult in distinct biological effects. Chain-length-dependent biological\nactivity has been shown in in vivo studies (e.g., mice, rats, and\nmarine mussel models). 26 − 28  In a study with mice, Lee and Kim suggested that\nthe length of the perfluorinated chain determines the effect, as they\nobserved increased NF-κB activity in the case of longer PFASs\n(C10 and C11) and no NF-κB activity in the case of shorter PFASs\n(C7 and C9). Similarly, Stevenson et al. observed a chain-length-specific\ninteraction between PFASs and efflux transporters, a multixenobiotic\nresistance mechanism that triggered the exporting chemicals from cells. 27  Further, a study with rats showed distinct toxicokinetic\nproperties for PFASs with different carbon chain lengths; specifically,\nthere was a high clearance rate for PFASs with shorter carbon chain\nlengths. 28  Different chemical–physical\nproperties, i.e., differences in lipophobic/hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl\ntails, can thus trigger both the fate of the chemicals in the organisms\nand the biological activity. It is important to note that specific\nstudies and research are needed to comprehensively evaluate and determine\nthe precise biological effects of PFPA compared to those of other\nPFAS compounds.\n\nFour cell processes\nwere identified by SNEA as being enriched ( Table  1  and  Figure  1 ): germinal center B cell differentiation, germinal\ncenter formation, the B cell receptor signaling pathway, and plasma\ncell differentiation. These enriched processes suggest that PFASs\ntarget B cell development, especially late B cell development (impaired\nprocesses are visualized in  Figure  1 ).\n\nB cell development. Processes in red frames\nwere enriched by genes\nassociated with multiple PFAS exposure (i.e., with at least four PFASs;\nsee  Table  1 ). B cells\ndevelop in bone marrow, where their B cell receptors (BCRs) undergo\nsomatic recombination, resulting in high variability in the BCR specificity\n(for a particular antigen) of individual B cells. These immature B\ncells enter the bloodstream and migrate to secondary lymphoid organs\n(e.g., the spleen and lymphoid nodes), where they become activated\nand create germinal centers. In a germinal center, a B cell undergoes\nsomatic hypermutation, selection, and class-switch recombination,\nand it becomes either a memory cell or a plasma cell, whereas the\nlatter is crucial for antibody production.\n\nGenes overlapping within significant cell processes (i.e., those\nlisted in  Table  1 )\nare shown in  Table  2 . These include the genes coding transcription factors E2A, E2-2,\nEBF1, OCT-2, and SPI-B, further the transmembrane molecule CD19, and\nthe histone demethylase LSD1, all of which are significantly involved\nin B cell development, including germinal center (GC) reactions. GCs\nplay a crucial role in the formation and maturation of plasma cells,\nwhich are a type of B cells that are responsible for producing antibodies.\n\nResults are expressed as β\ncoefficients produced by linear regression. Statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) are marked in bold with *. PFPA = perfluoropentanoate,\nPFOA = perfluorooctanoate, PFNA = perfluorononanoate, PFDA = perfluorodecanoate,\nPFUnDA = perfluoroundecanoate, PFHxS = pefluorohexane sulfonate, and\nPFOS = perfluorooctane sulfonate.\n\nThe transcription factors E2A (encoded by the  TCF3  gene) and E2-2 (encoded by the  TCF4  gene) belong\nto a group of E-proteins, and together, they cooperate to regulate\nB cell immunity, especially late B cell development. Both play a crucial\nrole in controlling GC and plasma cell development. While E2A has\nbeen shown to be a dominant E-protein in GC B cell differentiation,\nE2-2 plays a dominant role in plasma cell development. 29\n\nAnother transcription factor, which often\ncooperates with E2A,\nis early B cell factor EBF1. As its name indicates, EBF1 plays a key\nrole in the early stages of B cell development, specifically in the\npro-B cell stage. Additionally, EBF1 is known to play an important\nrole in GC formation. 30 , 31  Specifically, EBF1 has been shown\nto interact with PAX5, one of the crucial players in B cell differentiation,\nand together, they regulate the transcription of many genes during\nB cell development. The cooperation of these two transcription factors\nallows the expression of molecules such as CD19 and CD79b, which are\nimportant players in B cell signaling. 32\n\nCD19, besides being a unique characterization surface marker\nof\nB cells, has an indispensable functional role. CD19 modulates both\nBCR-dependent and BCR-independent signaling. 33  Specifically, CD19 often functions with CD21 (which is activated\nby binding of the antigen-C3d complex), CD81 (TAPA-1), and CD225 to\ncomprise a multimolecular complex that can transduce signals in both\na BCR-dependent and BCR-independent fashion. CD19 is a transmembrane\nprotein transducing signal to downstream protein kinases such as Lyn,\nFyn (Src family), Abl, Btk, PI3K, and Ras family kinases. 33 , 34  Further, CD19 is also required for optimal MHC class II-mediated\nsignaling through Akt kinase. 35\n\nOCT-2,\nencoded by the  POU2F2  gene, is a transcription\nfactor that is indispensable for GC formation. OCT-2 action is accompanied\nby the OBF1 coactivator, which stabilizes the binding of OCT-2 to\nchromatin. 36 , 37  Interestingly, these two factors\n(OCT2 and OBF1) are essential for the proliferation and survival of\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma. 37 , 38\n\nSPI-B is a transcription\nfactor that represses B cell differentiation. 39  However, SPI-B together with PU.1 (encoded by\nthe  SPI1  gene) is essential for signaling through\nBCR and through receptors for CD40L, BAFF, and TLR ligands. 40\n\nLSD1, encoded by  KDM1A , is a histone demethylase\nthat can regulate gene expression. It interacts with Blimp-1, which\nis an essential transcription factor for plasma cell differentiation. 41  On the basis of LSD1-deficient mice, LSD1 has\nbeen shown to be a crucial epigenetic modifier in plasma cell development\nby regulating chromatin accessibility. 41\n\nOverall, SNEA revealed four statistically significant cell\nprocesses\nthat were all related to B cells, specifically to GC reactions. Further,\ngenes abundantly present in these cell processes were negatively associated\nwith PFAS exposure except for PFPA. Such a negative association between\nthe genes and PFAS exposure indicates the downregulation of these\ngenes ( Table  2 ) and\ntheir respective cell processes ( Table  1 ). This finding is in line with epidemiological studies\nconnecting PFAS exposure to decreased antibody production, as GCs\nand plasma cells are crucial for antibody response.\n\nIn total, 126 entities\nwere significantly enriched by genes associated with multiple PFAS\nexposure by GSEA ( Table S4 ). GSEA provides\ndetailed information about enriched entities on levels such as biomarkers,\nsignal processing, biological processes, and diseases. The majority\nof the enriched entities were related to immunity terms, but there\nwere also non-immune terms and general biological processes. Enriched\nimmune-related entities included terms related to both innate and\nadaptive immunity. A prevalent motif within adaptive immunity terms\nis B cell activation and development, which corresponds to the results\nproduced by SNEA ( Table  2 ). The identified B cell-related entities were clustered into four\nmain domains: B cell receptor signaling, TLR signaling, T cell–B\ncell interaction, and E2A signaling ( Table  3 ).\n\nB cell receptor (BCR) signaling is crucial for B cell\nactivation\nand, therefore, for the subsequent creation of GCs. BCR signaling\nis very complex, as BCR cooperates with many other receptors and has\nseveral downstream intracellular signaling pathways 42  ( Table  3 , B cell receptor signaling cluster). Specifically, BCR can activate\nNFAT signaling downstream. 43  Even though\nNFAT signaling was discovered in T cells, it was later revealed that\nthis signaling pathway is essential for normal B cell homeostasis\nand differentiation. 44  Further, BCR signaling\ncan lead to the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB\nand AP-1, which are highly involved in regulating immune response. 43 , 45  Moreover, B cells at all stages (except plasma cells) express the\nCD72 molecule, which is a coreceptor that regulates BCR signaling. 46  In addition to BCRs, B cells express toll-like\nreceptors (TLRs), which play an important role in B cell activation.\nTLR signaling can therefore enhance the signal for B cell activation,\nand it is important for B cell differentiation in plasma cells. 47\n\nWhen a GC is formed, T follicular helper\ncells play an important\nrole in the coactivation of B cells, which is crucial for their future\ndifferentiation into plasma cells ( Table  3 , T cell–B cell interaction cluster).\nThis coactivation is ensured by a T cell receptor recognizing the\nantigen on the MHC class-II molecule expressed by a B cell, and further\nby the CD40L of the T cell binding to the CD40 receptor of the B cell\n( Figure  1 ). 42 , 48 − 50\n\nAs stated above, the  TCF3  gene\ncodes the transcription\nfactor E2A, which is essential for GC B cell differentiation ( Table  3 , E2A signaling cluster).\nNevertheless, the E2A function is regulated by other players, one\nof these being Notch proteins. 51  Notch\nproteins regulate whole B cell development, including plasma cell\ndifferentiation. 52  The importance of E2A\nin B cell development is also demonstrated by the fact that the disruption\nof the E2A function contributes to the progression of Hodgkin lymphoma. 53 , 54  Hodgkin lymphoma is a B cell-derived cancer and is characterized\nby the presence of Reed–Sternberg cells and Hodgkin cells. 55\n\nThe overall GSEA results indicate that\nmultiple PFAS exposure affects\npathways and genes of adaptive immunity; however, general entities\n(pathways and biomarkers) that play a role in the entire immune system,\nincluding innate immunity, were also identified. Within entities of\nadaptive immunity, processes involved in B cell activation, development,\nand differentiation were abundantly included, which is in line with\nthe results of SNEA. However, the results of GSEA indicate that PFAS\nexposure may also affect other processes within the entire immune\nsystem, demonstrating the complexity of PFAS immunomodulation.\n\nTaken together, the results of the current\nstudy indicate that multiple PFAS exposure influences the immune system\nin the phase of late B cell development, specifically B cell activation,\nGC reactions, and plasma cell development. As GCs and plasma cells\nare essential for antibody production, the findings of the current\nstudy are in line with suppressed antibody responses after vaccination\nassociated with PFAS exposure, which has been largely reported in\nthe literature. 6 , 56 − 60  Similarly, a recent in vivo study on mice showed\na decreased level of antibodies accompanied by a decreased number\nof splenic B cells, including plasma cells, due to PFOA exposure. 61  Further, the affected development of plasma\ncells, i.e., antibody-secreting cells, that was observed in our study\ncould be the underlying mechanism for the altered prevalence of allergic\ndiseases, as the IgE antibodies are the main effector agent in allergic\ndiseases. 62  Interestingly, PFAS exposure\nwas associated with both the increased 63 , 64  and decreased 14 , 65  prevalence of allergic diseases. This evidence indicates that the\neffects of PFAS exposure are complex and complicated, especially when\nwe are assessing exposure to a mixture of them, as different PFASs\ncan act differently, as was also shown in our study with the example\nof PFPA.\n\nDespite the fact that transcriptomic data from epidemiological\nstudies are highly valuable, there is a scarce number of them. Similar\nto our study, the effect of PFAS exposure on adaptive immunity, specifically\nthe deregulation of T cell signaling, was observed in a Norwegian\nBraMat human cohort study investigating transcriptomic profiles in\nneonatal cord blood. 66  Although both studies\nfocused on immunotoxicity, their design and samples differed. Because\nthe Norwegian study focused on the genes common for PFAS exposure\nand anti-rubella antibody levels at 3 years of age, the genes common\nfor PFAS exposure, and a number of common cold episodes until 3 years\nof age, the results are not directly comparable to the those of this\ncurrent study. Interestingly, a large cross-species transcriptomics\nanalysis, which included human samples, identified the neutrophil\ntertiary granule mechanism as being strongly conserved among species\nand proposed it as a potential mechanism underlying PFAS immunotoxicity.\nNeutrophils are the most abundant cells of innate immunity and are\nevolutionarily more conserved through different species compared to\nB cell signaling and other adaptive immunity processes. A strong pattern\nrelated to neutrophils was not shown in our study, as our analysis\nwas based on the transcriptome of PBMCs that do not contain neutrophils.\nEven though a PBMC sample does not contain all of the immune cells\nin the same ratio as in a living organism (innate immune cells in\nparticular are not represented in full numbers), PBMCs are considered\na valuable matrix for transcriptomic analysis. 67\n\nThe detailed mechanism behind PFAS immunotoxicity\nis still not\nfully understood. We described for the first time the alteration in\nB cell development as a potential mode of action on human samples.\nAmong others, we identified NF-κB and NFAT signaling, which\nhave already been described as being associated with PFAS exposure. 8  In both human and animal studies, the association\nof PFAS exposure with a disbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines has been observed. 8  However, the evidence of this imbalance is inconsistent\nbetween published studies and is thus inconclusive. Nevertheless,\na disbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines could further affect B cell development\nin stages such as B cell activation, GC formation, antibody-secreting\nplasma cell development, or memory B cells differentiation.\n\nIn conclusion, the utilization of genome-wide sequencing in this\nstudy revealed that BCR signaling, GC reactions, and the development\nof plasma cells could be behind the potential mechanisms underlying\nPFAS immunotoxicity. Future research should be conducted on B cell\ndevelopment and germinal centers as the target for PFASs to verify\nthe results of the current study, preferably using controlled toxicological\nexperiments. A further relevant avenue that needs to be explored is\ndetermining the long-term effects of PFAS exposure on immune function\nand potential immunological memory and/or examining the broader consequences\nof PFAS-induced immunotoxicity on the overall immune response, including\nthe susceptibility to infections, allergies, autoimmune diseases,\nand impaired vaccine responses. We believe that such further investigations\nmay enhance our understanding of immunotoxicity not only for currently\nused PFASs but also prospectively for their chemically similar alternatives.\n\n## Gene Expression Significantly\nAssociated with\nMultiple PFAS Exposure\n\nOur analysis identified 166 genes\nthat were significantly ( p  < 0.05) associated\nwith exposure to at least four of the seven examined PFASs (PFPA,\nPFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS;  Figure S2 ). However, no genes were significantly associated when the\nmore stringent statistical analysis (FDR correction) was applied.\nThe analysis did not identify a single gene associated with all seven\nPFASs. However, 10 out of the 166 genes were associated with the levels\nof six PFASs, and 44 genes were associated with five PFASs. It is\nworth noting that, apart from PFPA, all of the other PFASs (PFOA,\nPFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFHxS, and PFOS) demonstrated a congruent direction\nof effect for individual genes, either the downregulation or the upregulation\nof gene expression ( Figure S2 ). This trend\nis visible when looking at the same color in each row in  Figure S2 : red indicates the upregulation of\ngene expression, and blue indicates the downregulation of gene expression.\nThis overall trend revealed a contrasting relationship between PFPA\nexposure and gene expression compared to the other PFASs, as the associations\nexhibit opposite directions. Further, compared to the other PFASs,\nPFPA had only a few statistically significant ( p  <\n0.05) associations ( Table S3 ).\n\nPFPA\nstands out among other PFAS compounds due to its shorter perfluorinated\ncarbon chain comprising only four fluorinated carbons and due to it\nbeing the only short-chain PFAS. In contrast to the other long-chain\nPFAS compounds analyzed in this study, this disparity in carbon chain\nlength grants PFPA distinctive chemical properties and attributes. 25  Consequently, this variation could potentially\nresult in distinct biological effects. Chain-length-dependent biological\nactivity has been shown in in vivo studies (e.g., mice, rats, and\nmarine mussel models). 26 − 28  In a study with mice, Lee and Kim suggested that\nthe length of the perfluorinated chain determines the effect, as they\nobserved increased NF-κB activity in the case of longer PFASs\n(C10 and C11) and no NF-κB activity in the case of shorter PFASs\n(C7 and C9). Similarly, Stevenson et al. observed a chain-length-specific\ninteraction between PFASs and efflux transporters, a multixenobiotic\nresistance mechanism that triggered the exporting chemicals from cells. 27  Further, a study with rats showed distinct toxicokinetic\nproperties for PFASs with different carbon chain lengths; specifically,\nthere was a high clearance rate for PFASs with shorter carbon chain\nlengths. 28  Different chemical–physical\nproperties, i.e., differences in lipophobic/hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl\ntails, can thus trigger both the fate of the chemicals in the organisms\nand the biological activity. It is important to note that specific\nstudies and research are needed to comprehensively evaluate and determine\nthe precise biological effects of PFPA compared to those of other\nPFAS compounds.\n\n## Pathways Enriched by Genes\nAssociated with\nMultiple PFAS Exposure Identified by SNEA\n\nFour cell processes\nwere identified by SNEA as being enriched ( Table  1  and  Figure  1 ): germinal center B cell differentiation, germinal\ncenter formation, the B cell receptor signaling pathway, and plasma\ncell differentiation. These enriched processes suggest that PFASs\ntarget B cell development, especially late B cell development (impaired\nprocesses are visualized in  Figure  1 ).\n\nB cell development. Processes in red frames\nwere enriched by genes\nassociated with multiple PFAS exposure (i.e., with at least four PFASs;\nsee  Table  1 ). B cells\ndevelop in bone marrow, where their B cell receptors (BCRs) undergo\nsomatic recombination, resulting in high variability in the BCR specificity\n(for a particular antigen) of individual B cells. These immature B\ncells enter the bloodstream and migrate to secondary lymphoid organs\n(e.g., the spleen and lymphoid nodes), where they become activated\nand create germinal centers. In a germinal center, a B cell undergoes\nsomatic hypermutation, selection, and class-switch recombination,\nand it becomes either a memory cell or a plasma cell, whereas the\nlatter is crucial for antibody production.\n\nGenes overlapping within significant cell processes (i.e., those\nlisted in  Table  1 )\nare shown in  Table  2 . These include the genes coding transcription factors E2A, E2-2,\nEBF1, OCT-2, and SPI-B, further the transmembrane molecule CD19, and\nthe histone demethylase LSD1, all of which are significantly involved\nin B cell development, including germinal center (GC) reactions. GCs\nplay a crucial role in the formation and maturation of plasma cells,\nwhich are a type of B cells that are responsible for producing antibodies.\n\nResults are expressed as β\ncoefficients produced by linear regression. Statistically significant\nresults (p < 0.05) are marked in bold with *. PFPA = perfluoropentanoate,\nPFOA = perfluorooctanoate, PFNA = perfluorononanoate, PFDA = perfluorodecanoate,\nPFUnDA = perfluoroundecanoate, PFHxS = pefluorohexane sulfonate, and\nPFOS = perfluorooctane sulfonate.\n\nThe transcription factors E2A (encoded by the  TCF3  gene) and E2-2 (encoded by the  TCF4  gene) belong\nto a group of E-proteins, and together, they cooperate to regulate\nB cell immunity, especially late B cell development. Both play a crucial\nrole in controlling GC and plasma cell development. While E2A has\nbeen shown to be a dominant E-protein in GC B cell differentiation,\nE2-2 plays a dominant role in plasma cell development. 29\n\nAnother transcription factor, which often\ncooperates with E2A,\nis early B cell factor EBF1. As its name indicates, EBF1 plays a key\nrole in the early stages of B cell development, specifically in the\npro-B cell stage. Additionally, EBF1 is known to play an important\nrole in GC formation. 30 , 31  Specifically, EBF1 has been shown\nto interact with PAX5, one of the crucial players in B cell differentiation,\nand together, they regulate the transcription of many genes during\nB cell development. The cooperation of these two transcription factors\nallows the expression of molecules such as CD19 and CD79b, which are\nimportant players in B cell signaling. 32\n\nCD19, besides being a unique characterization surface marker\nof\nB cells, has an indispensable functional role. CD19 modulates both\nBCR-dependent and BCR-independent signaling. 33  Specifically, CD19 often functions with CD21 (which is activated\nby binding of the antigen-C3d complex), CD81 (TAPA-1), and CD225 to\ncomprise a multimolecular complex that can transduce signals in both\na BCR-dependent and BCR-independent fashion. CD19 is a transmembrane\nprotein transducing signal to downstream protein kinases such as Lyn,\nFyn (Src family), Abl, Btk, PI3K, and Ras family kinases. 33 , 34  Further, CD19 is also required for optimal MHC class II-mediated\nsignaling through Akt kinase. 35\n\nOCT-2,\nencoded by the  POU2F2  gene, is a transcription\nfactor that is indispensable for GC formation. OCT-2 action is accompanied\nby the OBF1 coactivator, which stabilizes the binding of OCT-2 to\nchromatin. 36 , 37  Interestingly, these two factors\n(OCT2 and OBF1) are essential for the proliferation and survival of\ndiffuse large B cell lymphoma. 37 , 38\n\nSPI-B is a transcription\nfactor that represses B cell differentiation. 39  However, SPI-B together with PU.1 (encoded by\nthe  SPI1  gene) is essential for signaling through\nBCR and through receptors for CD40L, BAFF, and TLR ligands. 40\n\nLSD1, encoded by  KDM1A , is a histone demethylase\nthat can regulate gene expression. It interacts with Blimp-1, which\nis an essential transcription factor for plasma cell differentiation. 41  On the basis of LSD1-deficient mice, LSD1 has\nbeen shown to be a crucial epigenetic modifier in plasma cell development\nby regulating chromatin accessibility. 41\n\nOverall, SNEA revealed four statistically significant cell\nprocesses\nthat were all related to B cells, specifically to GC reactions. Further,\ngenes abundantly present in these cell processes were negatively associated\nwith PFAS exposure except for PFPA. Such a negative association between\nthe genes and PFAS exposure indicates the downregulation of these\ngenes ( Table  2 ) and\ntheir respective cell processes ( Table  1 ). This finding is in line with epidemiological studies\nconnecting PFAS exposure to decreased antibody production, as GCs\nand plasma cells are crucial for antibody response.\n\n## Pathways Enriched by Genes Associated with\nMultiple PFAS Exposure Identified by GSEA\n\nIn total, 126 entities\nwere significantly enriched by genes associated with multiple PFAS\nexposure by GSEA ( Table S4 ). GSEA provides\ndetailed information about enriched entities on levels such as biomarkers,\nsignal processing, biological processes, and diseases. The majority\nof the enriched entities were related to immunity terms, but there\nwere also non-immune terms and general biological processes. Enriched\nimmune-related entities included terms related to both innate and\nadaptive immunity. A prevalent motif within adaptive immunity terms\nis B cell activation and development, which corresponds to the results\nproduced by SNEA ( Table  2 ). The identified B cell-related entities were clustered into four\nmain domains: B cell receptor signaling, TLR signaling, T cell–B\ncell interaction, and E2A signaling ( Table  3 ).\n\nB cell receptor (BCR) signaling is crucial for B cell\nactivation\nand, therefore, for the subsequent creation of GCs. BCR signaling\nis very complex, as BCR cooperates with many other receptors and has\nseveral downstream intracellular signaling pathways 42  ( Table  3 , B cell receptor signaling cluster). Specifically, BCR can activate\nNFAT signaling downstream. 43  Even though\nNFAT signaling was discovered in T cells, it was later revealed that\nthis signaling pathway is essential for normal B cell homeostasis\nand differentiation. 44  Further, BCR signaling\ncan lead to the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB\nand AP-1, which are highly involved in regulating immune response. 43 , 45  Moreover, B cells at all stages (except plasma cells) express the\nCD72 molecule, which is a coreceptor that regulates BCR signaling. 46  In addition to BCRs, B cells express toll-like\nreceptors (TLRs), which play an important role in B cell activation.\nTLR signaling can therefore enhance the signal for B cell activation,\nand it is important for B cell differentiation in plasma cells. 47\n\nWhen a GC is formed, T follicular helper\ncells play an important\nrole in the coactivation of B cells, which is crucial for their future\ndifferentiation into plasma cells ( Table  3 , T cell–B cell interaction cluster).\nThis coactivation is ensured by a T cell receptor recognizing the\nantigen on the MHC class-II molecule expressed by a B cell, and further\nby the CD40L of the T cell binding to the CD40 receptor of the B cell\n( Figure  1 ). 42 , 48 − 50\n\nAs stated above, the  TCF3  gene\ncodes the transcription\nfactor E2A, which is essential for GC B cell differentiation ( Table  3 , E2A signaling cluster).\nNevertheless, the E2A function is regulated by other players, one\nof these being Notch proteins. 51  Notch\nproteins regulate whole B cell development, including plasma cell\ndifferentiation. 52  The importance of E2A\nin B cell development is also demonstrated by the fact that the disruption\nof the E2A function contributes to the progression of Hodgkin lymphoma. 53 , 54  Hodgkin lymphoma is a B cell-derived cancer and is characterized\nby the presence of Reed–Sternberg cells and Hodgkin cells. 55\n\nThe overall GSEA results indicate that\nmultiple PFAS exposure affects\npathways and genes of adaptive immunity; however, general entities\n(pathways and biomarkers) that play a role in the entire immune system,\nincluding innate immunity, were also identified. Within entities of\nadaptive immunity, processes involved in B cell activation, development,\nand differentiation were abundantly included, which is in line with\nthe results of SNEA. However, the results of GSEA indicate that PFAS\nexposure may also affect other processes within the entire immune\nsystem, demonstrating the complexity of PFAS immunomodulation.\n\n## Possible Underlying Mechanism of PFAS-Induced\nImmunomodulation\n\nTaken together, the results of the current\nstudy indicate that multiple PFAS exposure influences the immune system\nin the phase of late B cell development, specifically B cell activation,\nGC reactions, and plasma cell development. As GCs and plasma cells\nare essential for antibody production, the findings of the current\nstudy are in line with suppressed antibody responses after vaccination\nassociated with PFAS exposure, which has been largely reported in\nthe literature. 6 , 56 − 60  Similarly, a recent in vivo study on mice showed\na decreased level of antibodies accompanied by a decreased number\nof splenic B cells, including plasma cells, due to PFOA exposure. 61  Further, the affected development of plasma\ncells, i.e., antibody-secreting cells, that was observed in our study\ncould be the underlying mechanism for the altered prevalence of allergic\ndiseases, as the IgE antibodies are the main effector agent in allergic\ndiseases. 62  Interestingly, PFAS exposure\nwas associated with both the increased 63 , 64  and decreased 14 , 65  prevalence of allergic diseases.
