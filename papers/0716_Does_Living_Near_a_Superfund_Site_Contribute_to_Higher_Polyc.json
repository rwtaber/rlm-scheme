  "abstract": "We assessed determinants of cord serum polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels\namong 720 infants born between 1993 and 1998 to mothers living near\na PCB-contaminated Superfund site in Massachusetts, measuring the\nsum of 51 PCB congeners (∑PCB) and ascertaining maternal address, diet, sociodemographics, and exposure risk factors. Addresses were\ngeocoded to obtain distance to the Superfund site and neighborhood characteristics. We\nmodeled log10(∑PCB) as a function of potential individual and neighborhood risk\nfactors, mapping model residuals to assess spatial correlates of PCB\nexposure. Similar analyses were performed for light (mono–tetra) and\nheavy (penta–deca) PCBs to assess potential differences\nin exposure pathways as a function of relative volatility. PCB-118 (relatively\nprevalent in site sediments and cord serum) was assessed\nseparately. The geometric mean of ∑PCB levels was 0.40 (range, 0.068–18.14) ng/g\nserum. Maternal age and birthplace were the\nstrongest predictors of ∑PCB levels. Maternal consumption of\norgan meat and local dairy products was associated with higher and smoking\nand previous lactation with lower ∑PCB levels. Infants born\nlater in the study had lower ∑PCB levels, likely due to temporal\ndeclines in exposure and site remediation in 1994–1995. No\nassociation was found between ∑PCB levels and residential distance\nfrom the Superfund site. Similar results were found with light\nand heavy PCBs and PCB-118. Previously reported demographic (age) and\nother (lactation, smoking, diet) correlates of PCB exposure, as well\nas local factors (consumption of local dairy products and Superfund site\ndredging) but not residential proximity to the site, were important\ndeterminants of cord serum PCB levels in the study community.",

      "text": "Study participants were part of an ongoing cohort study of PCBs and child\ndevelopment. Mother–infant pairs were recruited just after\nbirth at St. Luke’s Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts, between\nMarch 1993 and December 1998. Dredging of PCB-contaminated New Bedford\nHarbor sediments occurred in the middle of the study recruitment\nperiod (April 1994 to September 1995). Participation was limited to\nconsenting mothers (18 or more years of age) who had resided in one of\nthe four towns (New Bedford, Acushnet, Fairhaven, Dartmouth) bordering\nNew Bedford Harbor for the duration of their pregnancy. Infants born\nby cesarean section were excluded. Infants who required high-grade neonatal\ncare or were otherwise not available for a newborn examination\nwere not included in the study. Of the 788 participants in the birth cohort study, 37 did not have a cord\nserum sample (not collected at birth or lost during laboratory sample\npreparation). We excluded one infant whose mother’s address\nwas missing, two younger twins, and 28 younger siblings, leaving a total\nof 720 infants available for analysis. The human subjects committees of Harvard School of Public Health, Brigham\nand Women’s Hospital of Boston, and St. Luke’s Hospital\nof New Bedford, Massachusetts, approved the protocol of this study. Data\nwere collected after written informed consents were obtained from\nstudy mothers. Cord blood samples were obtained at birth in Vacutainer tubes and centrifuged, and\nthe serum fraction was removed. The serum was stored in solvent-rinsed\nglass vials with Teflon-lined caps at –20°C\nuntil extraction. Analyses were performed by the Harvard School of\nPublic Health Organic Chemistry Laboratory. Cord blood analytic methods\nand quality control procedures are described elsewhere (Korrick et al. 2000). Briefly, 51 individual PCB congeners were measured using liquid–liquid\nextraction and extract analysis by capillary column gas chromatography\nwith electron capture detection. Confirmatory analyses were\ndone with microelectron capture detection and a capillary column of\ndifferent polarity. Serum lipids were not measured because of insufficient\nsample volume. PCB concentrations were reported as the sum of 51 congeners (∑PCB) in units of nanograms of analyte per gram of\nserum. We also grouped PCB levels into light PCBs (sum of 14 mono- to\ntetrachlorinated biphenyls) and heavy PCBs (sum of 37 pentato decachlorinated\nbiphenyls) according to their elution order and relative volatility (Cullen et al. 1996). These two groups were chosen a priori based on the hypothesis that PCB exposure pathways may vary by their relative\nvolatility. The 51 congeners were chosen based on their toxicity, persistence in the\nenvironment or human samples, and presence in New Bedford environmental\nsamples; these included a subset of mono-ortho dioxin-like PCBs (congeners 105, 118, 156, 167, and 189). The dioxin TEQ\nconcentration for the dioxin-like PCBs was calculated (Van den Berg et al. 1998) and expressed in parts per trillion (ppt) lipid, assuming 0.17% lipid\nfor cord serum based on our laboratory’s data and published\nvalues (Altshul LM, personal communication; Denkins et al. 2000). PCB-118 was chosen a priori for individual assessment. It was prevalent\nin harbor sediments consistent with the predominant Aroclors used\nby the area’s industries (Brown and Wagner 1990; Weaver 1984). In addition, it was disproportionately prevalent in our serum samples; cord\nserum levels of PCB-118 were comparable with levels observed in\nother population-based surveys (Korrick et al. 2000) despite overall PCB levels being substantially lower than most other\npopulations (Longnecker et al. 2003). Mothers completed a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire during\na home evaluation of the child at age 2 weeks. The mothers reported\ndiet histories before and during pregnancy. Twenty-four items from the\nfood-frequency questionnaire were collapsed into six groups: meat (including\norgan meat), poultry, dairy, eggs, grains, and fish. We further\nconsidered fish in four subcategories: tuna; dark-meat fish (mackerel, blue\nfish, salmon, sardines, and swordfish); other fish (including\ncatfish), and shellfish. In addition, mother’s self-reported consumption\nof locally grown produce, dairy products (including eggs), meat (including\nchicken), fish, game, and wine were determined as binary (yes/no) variables. Mothers’ potential occupational PCB exposure (including working\nwith paints, sealants, caulking compounds, and lubricants), gardening, and\nother potentially PCB-exposure–related activities (including\nuse of pesticides and fertilizers) were determined by interviewer-administered\nquestionnaire at the 2-week evaluation. Total person-years\nof exposure were calculated separately for occupation, gardening, and\nother. Potential exposures were reported as the sum of years from self-reports\nof engagement in these activities for at least 1 day per week. For\neach exposure pathway, we divided person-years of potential exposure\ninto three categories: zero and below and above the 75th percentile\nof nonzero values. We determined maternal age, birthplace, race, education, marital status, reproductive\nhistory, pregnancy smoking and alcohol consumption, residential\nhistory, household income, and infant’s race and sex\nfrom the 2-week questionnaire and maternal and infant medical records. Home address for the duration of the mother’s pregnancy was geocoded\nby Mapping Analytics (Rochester, NY), a commercial geocoding firm\npreviously shown to have good (96%) accuracy (Krieger et al. 2001). We used the geocoded residence location for mapping, calculating distance\nfrom the Superfund site, and retrieving Census block group data. A map of New Bedford Harbor PCB levels (U.S. EPA 2001) was aligned to the Massachusetts town boundaries (MassGIS 2002; scale 1:25,000 meter units) using ArcGIS (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA) to\nestimate the latitude and longitude of the harbor hot spot. Residential\ndistance (in miles) from the hot spot was used as an index of potential\nsite-related PCB exposure. Indoor PCB sources include pre-1977 sealants, electrical appliances, and\nlight fixtures (Balfanz et al. 1993; Vorhees et al. 1997). We did not have information about individual home characteristics, but\nas a proxy, we calculated the fraction of houses built between 1940 and 1979 compared\nwith the total number of houses built through 1990, using 1990 Census\nblock group data. We constructed neighborhood socioeconomic indices based on 1990 Census\nblock group data (Krieger et al. 2003): a) crowding—percentage of households with more than one person per\nroom; b) poverty—percentage of persons below the federally defined poverty\nline ($12,647 for a family of four in 1989); c) low income—percentage of households with income less than 60% of\nthe U.S. median household income ($18,000); d) median household income; e) high education—percentage of persons, 25 or more years of age, with\nat least 4 years of college; and f ) low education—percentage of persons, 25 or more years of age, with\nless than a 12th grade education. The cord serum PCB levels were highly positively skewed and were log10 transformed for linear regression analyses. Univariate and bivariate associations\nwere explored. Associations between log PCB levels and continuous\ncovariates were assessed using scatter plot smoothing (Venables and Ripley 1997) to examine any nonlinear relationships. Potential exposure risk factors were divided into those associated with\nexposure pathways—dietary, inhalation, and dermal exposure sources—and\nthose related to individual characteristics. A set of\ncore individual characteristics was included in each exposure pathway\nanalysis: maternal age and birthplace, smoking during pregnancy, previous\nlactation, child’s date of birth and sex, dredging period, and\nhousehold income. Individual socioeconomic indicators (maternal\neducation and race) were also included in models assessing neighborhood\nsocioeconomic indicators and PCB levels. Multivariate models for log\nPCB included the core individual characteristics and exposure pathway\ncovariates significant (p < 0.10) in at least one of the individual pathway models for at least\none of the PCB measures (∑PCB, heavy PCBs, light PCBs and PCB-118). Regression\nresults are reported as the relative (percent) increase\nin PCB level associated with each predictor, calculated as the antilog\nof the regression coefficient and 95% confidence intervals. PCB levels were mapped and a smoothed surface was fitted by kriging (Cressie 1991) using ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst (ESRI Inc.). We estimated the surface\nby an inverse-distance weighted average of 25 neighboring points\nchosen on the basis of a small-prediction mean square error and a reasonable\narea to detect local spatial variability. We restricted this mapping\nto residences within a 5-mile radius of the hot spot. Similar mapping\nwas performed for multivariate model residuals to provide information\non any unmeasured spatial correlates of PCB exposure. To protect\nthe confidentiality of participants, each residence location was offset\nby a random amount generated from a normal distribution with mean zero\nand standard deviation (SD) equal to 1% of the SD of residence\nlatitudes and longitudes. Generalized additive models (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990) were fit in S-Plus (version 3.4; Insightful Corp., Seattle, WA) to assess temporal variability\nin PCB levels. The span parameter with the lowest Akaike information\ncriterion (AIC) for each PCB measure was chosen. Linear regression\nmodels were fit in SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."

      "text": "Cord serum PCB levels had geometric means (SDs) as follows: ∑PCB, 0.40 (2.02) ng/g\nwith a range of 0.068–18.14 ng/g; heavy PCBs, 0.33 (2.09) ng/g\nwith a range of 0.035–11.91 ng/g; light PCBs, 0.063 (2.12) ng/g\nwith a range of 0.0074–6.23 ng/g; PCB-118, 0.035 (2.37) ng/g\nwith a range of 0–2.05 ng/g; and dioxin-like\nPCB TEQs, 4.40 (2.39) ppt lipid, with a range of 0–151.5 ppt\nlipid. Maternal, infant, and household characteristics are shown in Table 1. Twenty percent of mothers were born outside of the United States (14% from\nPortugal, the Azores, or Cape Verde). Most (58%) had\nan educational level of high school or less, and 70% had\nan annual household income of < $40,000; 75% of the\nstudy population resided within 3.9 miles of the hot spot. Half of the\ninfants were born after the harbor was dredged (October 1995 and later). Maternal age at the infant’s birth was strongly associated with\ncord serum PCB levels, which declined over time, with additional declines\nafter the harbor dredging was completed (Table 1, Figure 2). Mothers who were born in Portugal, the Azores, or Cape Verde and female\ninfants had significantly higher cord serum PCB levels (Table 1). After adjustment for maternal age, prior lactation and higher household\nincome were associated with lower cord serum PCB levels. Maternal\nsmoking during pregnancy was also associated with lower PCB levels (Table 1). These parameters were defined as core covariates and included in subsequent\nanalyses. Maternal marital status, alcohol consumption during\npregnancy, and infant race were not associated with serum PCB levels. PCB associations with maternal diet before and during pregnancy were essentially\nthe same. We report the results of analyses assessing diet during\npregnancy. Maternal intake of organ meats (liver, tripe, kidney, bone\nmarrow) was significantly associated with higher PCB levels (p < 0.05) for ∑PCB, light PCBs, and PCB-118 after adjustment\nfor the base model covariates (p = 0.05 for heavy PCBs) (Table 2). Consumption of local dairy products (including eggs) was associated\nwith significantly higher levels of ∑PCB and heavy PCBs. Consumption\nof dark fish was positively associated with PCB levels, but this\nassociation was only marginally significant for light PCBs and PCB-118 (Table 2). Mothers who were long-term gardeners had infants with lower heavy PCB and\nPCB-118 levels than infants of mothers who did not garden; however, this\nassociation was based on a very small sample size (n = 9) and therefore was not included in our final multivariate\nmodel. Otherwise, we found no consistent association of cord serum PCB\nlevels with PCB-related occupations or activities, distance of residence\nfrom the hot spot, or age of homes in the child’s neighborhood (Table 3). Although there was a tendency for infants born to mothers living in\npoor or low-income neighborhoods to have higher light PCB levels than\nthose born to mothers living in other neighborhoods, these associations\nwere not significant (Table 4). We constructed multivariate models including core covariates and significant\ncovariates from the pathway analyses (Table 5). Maternal age and birthplace (in Portugal, the Azores, or Cape Verde) remained\nthe strongest predictors of cord serum PCB levels (p < 0.001). In addition, infants born late in the study had significantly\nlower PCB levels than infants born early in the study (Table 5). Even with adjustment for infant birth date, infants born after dredging\nhad significantly lower light PCB and PCB-118 levels, with near significance\nfor ∑PCB levels (Table 5). Covariate-adjusted smoothed plots of ∑PCB, heavy PCB, light\nPCB, and PCB-118 levels by infant date of birth corroborate the apparent\nindependent dredging effect (Figure 2). Mother’s prior lactation and smoking during pregnancy were significantly\nassociated with lower PCB levels, and maternal consumption\nof organ meat and locally produced dairy were associated significantly\nwith higher PCB levels (Table 5). Maps of unadjusted log10(∑PCB) levels (Figure 1A) and log10(∑PCB) residuals from the multivariate adjusted model (Figure 1B) showed spatial variability in PCB levels but no relationship to proximity\nof residence to the PCB hot spot. Similar results were found with\nheavy and light PCB levels. Results of pathway analyses for dioxin-like PCB TEQs were similar to those\nof the four other PCB measures. Significant predictors of higher PCB\nTEQ concentrations included older maternal age; maternal birth in Portugal, the\nAzores, or Cape Verde; and consumption of red meat during\npregnancy. Mother’s previous lactation, smoking during pregnancy, and\ninfant birth at end of the study were associated with lower PCB\nTEQs."

      "text": "We found no evidence that living closer to the New Bedford Harbor Superfund\nsite was associated with increased cord serum PCB levels either in\nthe crude unadjusted means or after adjusting for other risk factors\nfor PCB exposure in the study population. However, children born before or during dredging had consistently higher\ncord serum PCB levels than children born after dredging, even after\nwe accounted for birth date (Table 5, Figure 2), suggesting a possible effect of the PCB-contaminated site and its dredging\non cord blood PCB levels. Serum levels of light PCBs were more\nstrongly associated with dredging than were heavy PCBs (Table 5). This finding suggests that differences in PCB volatility affect exposure\nrisks potentially associated with the site. Furthermore, for PCB-118, a\ndioxin-like pentachlorinated biphenyl disproportionately prevalent\nin study samples, the dredging effect was more significant than the\ntemporal decline, with near-constant concentrations before dredging, an\nincrease during dredging, and a significant decline after dredging (Figure 2). Overall, these results support modest, transient increases in cord serum\nPCB levels during dredging, with significant declines in serum PCB\nlevels observed after dredging, particularly for the more volatile PCBs\nand PCB-118 (Table 5, Figure 2). The apparent differential effects of remediation on cord serum levels\nof various congeners are notable given possible congener-specific differences\nin toxicity. In addition to the previously described dredging associations, maternal\nconsumption of locally produced dairy products—an exposure risk\nfactor potentially related to the contaminated site—was associated\nwith higher cord serum PCB levels (Tables 2, 5). The most important predictor of elevated cord serum PCB levels was older\nmaternal age at the birth of the study infant. Older age is a well-established\nrisk factor for increased serum organochlorine concentrations, presumably\nas a consequence of cumulative exposure and temporal trends\nin exposure (Kutz et al. 1991). In multivariate models, we found that older maternal age and earlier\nbirth year were both associated with elevated cord blood PCB levels, indicating\nboth cumulative exposure and temporal trend effects. Mothers born in Portugal, the Azores, or Cape Verde had infants with substantially\nhigher cord serum PCB levels than mothers born in the United\nStates, Canada, or other countries, even after adjustment for diet\nor other lifestyle covariates that may vary by country of origin (Table 5). Although this observed association may be a chance finding or consequent\nto residual confounding by diet or lifestyle, it is also consistent\nwith potentially higher early-life exposure to PCBs resulting in higher\nserum levels during pregnancy. For example, PCB contamination is\npresent in fish species from southern Europe and the Atlantic Ocean along\nthe Azore Islands (Stefanelli et al. 2004). Higher early-life exposure to PCBs has been associated with higher serum\nlevels in adulthood among other populations (Rylander et al. 1997). We confirmed the previously reported association of prior lactation with\nlower serum PCB levels, which is likely due to PCB excretion in milk (Fitzgerald et al. 1998; Jensen 1991). Smoking during pregnancy was also associated with lower cord serum PCBs. Previous\nstudies have been inconsistent regarding the association\nof PCBs with smoking; maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated\nwith higher newborn PCB levels in one study (Lackman et al. 2000) but not in others (Fein et al. 1984; Rogan et al. 1986). Smoking may decrease organochlorine concentrations by enhancing their\nmetabolism via smoking-related induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (Deutch and Hansen 1999; Zevin and Benowitz 1999). Long-term gardening was associated with lower cord serum PCBs (Table 3), opposite to the hypothesized effect. However, the small number of long-term\ngardeners (n = 9) suggests that chance and/or confounding may explain this\nfinding. Of note, the final multivariate model (Table 5) was unchanged by the addition of gardening (data not shown). In addition to these correlates of exposure, maternal consumption of organ\nmeat and local dairy products (Tables 2, 5) was associated with significantly higher cord blood PCB levels, but other\npotential dietary risks (including fish intake) were not. Although\nfish and animal products have been identified as important sources of\ngeneral population exposure to PCBs and dioxins in some studies (Laden et al. 1999; Patandin et al. 1999), levels of PCBs and dioxins in fish and other foods have been declining (Hays and Aylward 2003). Contaminated areas of the harbor were closed to fishing in 1979 (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 1995), 14 years before we started this study. A lack of association of local\nfish consumption with serum PCB levels is consistent with the lag between\nlast likely intake of the most contaminated fish and our exposure\nassessment. Other evaluated risk factors did not explain heterogeneity in cord serum\nPCB levels. Although serum concentrations of PCB-exposed workers are\nhigher than those of the general population (Wolff et al. 1982), the small number of mothers with potential occupational exposure limited\nthe statistical power to detect such associations. Furthermore, the\nage of study mothers was such that most of their occupational (and\nother) activities occurred after the ban on PCBs. Neighborhood socioeconomic status and age of housing were not associated\nwith increased cord PCB levels. Although manufacturers incorporated\nPCBs in building materials and light fixtures during a well-defined time\nperiod (Balfanz et al. 1993), house age was not a good predictor of indoor air PCB concentrations\nin previous studies in New Bedford (Vorhees et al. 1997). This measure does not capture renovations or other potential indoor\nPCB sources such as electrical appliances or fluorescent lights. Moreover, the\nneighborhood distribution of home ages is an imperfect proxy\nfor the age of the specific home of interest. Correlates of cord serum PCBs did not vary much by the different congener\ngroupings assessed. For example, the exposure pathways we observed\nfor the heavy PCBs and ∑PCBs were quite similar (Table 5). This is likely because the correlation of ∑PCB levels with heavy\nPCBs was much higher (r = 0.99) than with light PCBs (r = 0.76), consistent with the predominance of heavy PCBs in the\nsum. Except for diet, correlates of PCB TEQ exposure were also similar\nto other PCB concentration measures. Specifically, maternal consumption\nof red meat, but not organ meat, was associated with significantly\nhigher PCB TEQs. Patandin et al. (1999) also found meat to be a major contributor to dietary intake of PCB TEQs. Because\nthe congeners are weighted by dioxin-like activity, these findings\nprovide insights into the correlates of potential toxicity, about\nwhich very little is known. There are several limitations in the interpretation of our findings. First, the\nmedian serum PCB level in our cohort was about one-quarter of\nthe overall median in a recent review of 10 studies of PCBs and neurodevelopment (Longnecker et al. 2003). Despite this limitation, our findings corroborate previously established\ncorrelates of serum PCB levels, including age and secular trends. In\naddition, the use of simplified proxies for some exposure pathways\nlimited our ability to determine the relative contribution of various\nroutes of exposure to cord serum PCB levels. In particular, it could\nbe argued that residential distance from the site does not capture outdoor\nconcentrations because it ignores prevailing winds. However, the\nmaps of cord serum PCB levels and model residuals do not indicate any\nlikely wind-related spatial patterns with this region’s prevailing\nwind direction from the south-southwest (Cullen et al. 1996). In addition, it is possible that including household income and other\ndemographic variables reduced our ability to characterize exposure pathways\nby overadjusting for these indirect correlates of exposure. However, sensitivity\nanalyses demonstrated that this was not the case. For\nexample, results of our pathway analyses were not substantially changed\nby removing income from the model. Lastly, the cross-sectional nature\nof this analysis limits the certainty of inferences regarding the\nobserved temporal-and dredging-associated differences in serum PCB levels. In conclusion, our findings among New Bedford area infants suggest that\nmaternal residence near a Superfund site per se does not lead to higher\ncord serum PCB levels independent of other exposure risk factors, such\nas maternal age, birthplace, diet, previous lactation, pregnancy smoking, and\ninfant date of birth. However, there was evidence of an important\nlocal impact on exposure risk as shown by increased cord serum\nPCB levels in association with maternal local dairy consumption and lower\ncord serum PCB levels after site dredging."

Mother–infant pairs were recruited just after\nbirth at St. Luke’s Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts, between\nMarch 1993 and December 1998. Dredging of PCB-contaminated New Bedford\nHarbor sediments occurred in the middle of the study recruitment\nperiod (April 1994 to September 1995). Participation was limited to\nconsenting mothers (18 or more years of age) who had resided in one of\nthe four towns (New Bedford, Acushnet, Fairhaven, Dartmouth) bordering\nNew Bedford Harbor for the duration of their pregnancy. Infants born\nby cesarean section were excluded. Infants who required high-grade neonatal\ncare or were otherwise not available for a newborn examination\nwere not included in the study. Of the 788 participants in the birth cohort study, 37 did not have a cord\nserum sample (not collected at birth or lost during laboratory sample\npreparation). We excluded one infant whose mother’s address\nwas missing, two younger twins, and 28 younger siblings, leaving a total\nof 720 infants available for analysis. The human subjects committees of Harvard School of Public Health, Brigham\nand Women’s Hospital of Boston, and St. Luke’s Hospital\nof New Bedford, Massachusetts, approved the protocol of this study. Data\nwere collected after written informed consents were obtained from\nstudy mothers. Cord blood samples were obtained at birth in Vacutainer tubes and centrifuged, and\nthe serum fraction was removed. The serum was stored in solvent-rinsed\nglass vials with Teflon-lined caps at –20°C\nuntil extraction. Analyses were performed by the Harvard School of\nPublic Health Organic Chemistry Laboratory. Cord blood analytic methods\nand quality control procedures are described elsewhere (Korrick et al. 2000). Briefly, 51 individual PCB congeners were measured using liquid–liquid\nextraction and extract analysis by capillary column gas chromatography\nwith electron capture detection. Confirmatory analyses were\ndone with microelectron capture detection and a capillary column of\ndifferent polarity. Serum lipids were not measured because of insufficient\nsample volume. PCB concentrations were reported as the sum of 51 congeners (∑PCB) in units of nanograms of analyte per gram of\nserum. We also grouped PCB levels into light PCBs (sum of 14 mono- to\ntetrachlorinated biphenyls) and heavy PCBs (sum of 37 pentato decachlorinated\nbiphenyls) according to their elution order and relative volatility (Cullen et al. 1996). These two groups were chosen a priori based on the hypothesis that PCB exposure pathways may vary by their relative\nvolatility. The 51 congeners were chosen based on their toxicity, persistence in the\nenvironment or human samples, and presence in New Bedford environmental\nsamples; these included a subset of mono-ortho dioxin-like PCBs (congeners 105, 118, 156, 167, and 189). The dioxin TEQ\nconcentration for the dioxin-like PCBs was calculated (Van den Berg et al. 1998) and expressed in parts per trillion (ppt) lipid, assuming 0.17% lipid\nfor cord serum based on our laboratory’s data and published\nvalues (Altshul LM, personal communication; Denkins et al. 2000). PCB-118 was chosen a priori for individual assessment. It was prevalent\nin harbor sediments consistent with the predominant Aroclors used\nby the area’s industries (Brown and Wagner 1990; Weaver 1984). In addition, it was disproportionately prevalent in our serum samples; cord\nserum levels of PCB-118 were comparable with levels observed in\nother population-based surveys (Korrick et al. 2000) despite overall PCB levels being substantially lower than most other\npopulations (Longnecker et al. 2003). Mothers completed a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire during\na home evaluation of the child at age 2 weeks. The mothers reported\ndiet histories before and during pregnancy. Twenty-four items from the\nfood-frequency questionnaire were collapsed into six groups: meat (including\norgan meat), poultry, dairy, eggs, grains, and fish. We further\nconsidered fish in four subcategories: tuna; dark-meat fish (mackerel, blue\nfish, salmon, sardines, and swordfish); other fish (including\ncatfish), and shellfish. In addition, mother’s self-reported consumption\nof locally grown produce, dairy products (including eggs), meat (including\nchicken), fish, game, and wine were determined as binary (yes/no) variables. Mothers’ potential occupational PCB exposure (including working\nwith paints, sealants, caulking compounds, and lubricants), gardening, and\nother potentially PCB-exposure–related activities (including\nuse of pesticides and fertilizers) were determined by interviewer-administered\nquestionnaire at the 2-week evaluation. Total person-years\nof exposure were calculated separately for occupation, gardening, and\nother. Potential exposures were reported as the sum of years from self-reports\nof engagement in these activities for at least 1 day per week. For\neach exposure pathway, we divided person-years of potential exposure\ninto three categories: zero and below and above the 75th percentile\nof nonzero values. We determined maternal age, birthplace, race, education, marital status, reproductive\nhistory, pregnancy smoking and alcohol consumption, residential\nhistory, household income, and infant’s race and sex\nfrom the 2-week questionnaire and maternal and infant medical records. Home address for the duration of the mother’s pregnancy was geocoded\nby Mapping Analytics (Rochester, NY), a commercial geocoding firm\npreviously shown to have good (96%) accuracy (Krieger et al. 2001). We used the geocoded residence location for mapping, calculating distance\nfrom the Superfund site, and retrieving Census block group data. A map of New Bedford Harbor PCB levels (U.S. EPA 2001) was aligned to the Massachusetts town boundaries (MassGIS 2002; scale 1:25,000 meter units) using ArcGIS (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA) to\nestimate the latitude and longitude of the harbor hot spot. Residential\ndistance (in miles) from the hot spot was used as an index of potential\nsite-related PCB exposure. Indoor PCB sources include pre-1977 sealants, electrical appliances, and\nlight fixtures (Balfanz et al. 1993; Vorhees et al. 1997). We did not have information about individual home characteristics, but\nas a proxy, we calculated the fraction of houses built between 1940 and 1979 compared\nwith the total number of houses built through 1990, using 1990 Census\nblock group data. We constructed neighborhood socioeconomic indices based on 1990 Census\nblock group data (Krieger et al. 2003): a) crowding—percentage of households with more than one person per\nroom; b) poverty—percentage of persons below the federally defined poverty\nline ($12,647 for a family of four in 1989); c) low income—percentage of households with income less than 60% of\nthe U.S. median household income ($18,000); d) median household income; e) high education—percentage of persons, 25 or more years of age, with\nat least 4 years of college; and f ) low education—percentage of persons, 25 or more years of age, with\nless than a 12th grade education. The cord serum PCB levels were highly positively skewed and were log10 transformed for linear regression analyses. Univariate and bivariate associations\nwere explored. Associations between log PCB levels and continuous\ncovariates were assessed using scatter plot smoothing (Venables and Ripley 1997) to examine any nonlinear relationships. Potential exposure risk factors were divided into those associated with\nexposure pathways—dietary, inhalation, and dermal exposure sources—and\nthose related to individual characteristics. A set of\ncore individual characteristics was included in each exposure pathway\nanalysis: maternal age and birthplace, smoking during pregnancy, previous\nlactation, child’s date of birth and sex, dredging period, and\nhousehold income. Individual socioeconomic indicators (maternal\neducation and race) were also included in models assessing neighborhood\nsocioeconomic indicators and PCB levels. Multivariate models for log\nPCB included the core individual characteristics and exposure pathway\ncovariates significant (p < 0.10) in at least one of the individual pathway models for at least\none of the PCB measures (∑PCB, heavy PCBs, light PCBs and PCB-118). Regression\nresults are reported as the relative (percent) increase\nin PCB level associated with each predictor, calculated as the antilog\nof the regression coefficient and 95% confidence intervals. PCB levels were mapped and a smoothed surface was fitted by kriging (Cressie 1991) using ArcGIS Geostatistical Analyst (ESRI Inc.). We estimated the surface\nby an inverse-distance weighted average of 25 neighboring points\nchosen on the basis of a small-prediction mean square error and a reasonable\narea to detect local spatial variability. We restricted this mapping\nto residences within a 5-mile radius of the hot spot. Similar mapping\nwas performed for multivariate model residuals to provide information\non any unmeasured spatial correlates of PCB exposure. To protect\nthe confidentiality of participants, each residence location was offset\nby a random amount generated from a normal distribution with mean zero\nand standard deviation (SD) equal to 1% of the SD of residence\nlatitudes and longitudes. Generalized additive models (Hastie and Tibshirani 1990) were fit in S-Plus (version 3.4; Insightful Corp., Seattle, WA) to assess temporal variability\nin PCB levels. The span parameter with the lowest Akaike information\ncriterion (AIC) for each PCB measure was chosen. Linear regression\nmodels were fit in SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\n\n## Study population\nStudy participants were part of an ongoing cohort study of PCBs and child\ndevelopment. Mother–infant pairs were recruited just after\nbirth at St. Luke’s Hospital in New Bedford, Massachusetts, between\nMarch 1993 and December 1998.

Data\nwere collected after written informed consents were obtained from\nstudy mothers.\n\n## Cord blood PCB levels\nCord blood samples were obtained at birth in Vacutainer tubes and centrifuged, and\nthe serum fraction was removed. The serum was stored in solvent-rinsed\nglass vials with Teflon-lined caps at –20°C\nuntil extraction. Analyses were performed by the Harvard School of\nPublic Health Organic Chemistry Laboratory.

The mothers reported\ndiet histories before and during pregnancy. Twenty-four items from the\nfood-frequency questionnaire were collapsed into six groups: meat (including\norgan meat), poultry, dairy, eggs, grains, and fish.

We used the geocoded residence location for mapping, calculating distance\nfrom the Superfund site, and retrieving Census block group data.

The span parameter with the lowest Akaike information\ncriterion (AIC) for each PCB measure was chosen. Linear regression\nmodels were fit in SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\n\n## Results\nCord serum PCB levels had geometric means (SDs) as follows: ∑PCB, 0.40 (2.02) ng/g\nwith a range of 0.068–18.14 ng/g; heavy PCBs, 0.33 (2.09) ng/g\nwith a range of 0.035–11.91 ng/g; light PCBs, 0.063 (2.12) ng/g\nwith a range of 0.0074–6.23 ng/g; PCB-118, 0.035 (2.37) ng/g\nwith a range of 0–2.05 ng/g; and dioxin-like\nPCB TEQs, 4.40 (2.39) ppt lipid, with a range of 0–151.5 ppt\nlipid. Maternal, infant, and household characteristics are shown in Table 1. Twenty percent of mothers were born outside of the United States (14% from\nPortugal, the Azores, or Cape Verde). Most (58%) had\nan educational level of high school or less, and 70% had\nan annual household income of < $40,000; 75% of the\nstudy population resided within 3.9 miles of the hot spot. Half of the\ninfants were born after the harbor was dredged (October 1995 and later). Maternal age at the infant’s birth was strongly associated with\ncord serum PCB levels, which declined over time, with additional declines\nafter the harbor dredging was completed (Table 1, Figure 2). Mothers who were born in Portugal, the Azores, or Cape Verde and female\ninfants had significantly higher cord serum PCB levels (Table 1). After adjustment for maternal age, prior lactation and higher household\nincome were associated with lower cord serum PCB levels. Maternal\nsmoking during pregnancy was also associated with lower PCB levels (Table 1). These parameters were defined as core covariates and included in subsequent\nanalyses. Maternal marital status, alcohol consumption during\npregnancy, and infant race were not associated with serum PCB levels. PCB associations with maternal diet before and during pregnancy were essentially\nthe same. We report the results of analyses assessing diet during\npregnancy. Maternal intake of organ meats (liver, tripe, kidney, bone\nmarrow) was significantly associated with higher PCB levels (p < 0.05) for ∑PCB, light PCBs, and PCB-118 after adjustment\nfor the base model covariates (p = 0.05 for heavy PCBs) (Table 2). Consumption of local dairy products (including eggs) was associated\nwith significantly higher levels of ∑PCB and heavy PCBs. Consumption\nof dark fish was positively associated with PCB levels, but this\nassociation was only marginally significant for light PCBs and PCB-118 (Table 2). Mothers who were long-term gardeners had infants with lower heavy PCB and\nPCB-118 levels than infants of mothers who did not garden; however, this\nassociation was based on a very small sample size (n = 9) and therefore was not included in our final multivariate\nmodel. Otherwise, we found no consistent association of cord serum PCB\nlevels with PCB-related occupations or activities, distance of residence\nfrom the hot spot, or age of homes in the child’s neighborhood (Table 3). Although there was a tendency for infants born to mothers living in\npoor or low-income neighborhoods to have higher light PCB levels than\nthose born to mothers living in other neighborhoods, these associations\nwere not significant (Table 4). We constructed multivariate models including core covariates and significant\ncovariates from the pathway analyses (Table 5). Maternal age and birthplace (in Portugal, the Azores, or Cape Verde) remained\nthe strongest predictors of cord serum PCB levels (p < 0.001). In addition, infants born late in the study had significantly\nlower PCB levels than infants born early in the study (Table 5). Even with adjustment for infant birth date, infants born after dredging\nhad significantly lower light PCB and PCB-118 levels, with near significance\nfor ∑PCB levels (Table 5). Covariate-adjusted smoothed plots of ∑PCB, heavy PCB, light\nPCB, and PCB-118 levels by infant date of birth corroborate the apparent\nindependent dredging effect (Figure 2). Mother’s prior lactation and smoking during pregnancy were significantly\nassociated with lower PCB levels, and maternal consumption\nof organ meat and locally produced dairy were associated significantly\nwith higher PCB levels (Table 5). Maps of unadjusted log10(∑PCB) levels (Figure 1A) and log10(∑PCB) residuals from the multivariate adjusted model (Figure 1B) showed spatial variability in PCB levels but no relationship to proximity\nof residence to the PCB hot spot. Similar results were found with\nheavy and light PCB levels. Results of pathway analyses for dioxin-like PCB TEQs were similar to those\nof the four other PCB measures. Significant predictors of higher PCB\nTEQ concentrations included older maternal age; maternal birth in Portugal, the\nAzores, or Cape Verde; and consumption of red meat during\npregnancy. Mother’s previous lactation, smoking during pregnancy, and\ninfant birth at end of the study were associated with lower PCB\nTEQs.\n\n## Discussion\nWe found no evidence that living closer to the New Bedford Harbor Superfund\nsite was associated with increased cord serum PCB levels either in\nthe crude unadjusted means or after adjusting for other risk factors\nfor PCB exposure in the study population. However, children born before or during dredging had consistently higher\ncord serum PCB levels than children born after dredging, even after\nwe accounted for birth date (Table 5, Figure 2), suggesting a possible effect of the PCB-contaminated site and its dredging\non cord blood PCB levels. Serum levels of light PCBs were more\nstrongly associated with dredging than were heavy PCBs (Table 5). This finding suggests that differences in PCB volatility affect exposure\nrisks potentially associated with the site. Furthermore, for PCB-118, a\ndioxin-like pentachlorinated biphenyl disproportionately prevalent\nin study samples, the dredging effect was more significant than the\ntemporal decline, with near-constant concentrations before dredging, an\nincrease during dredging, and a significant decline after dredging (Figure 2). Overall, these results support modest, transient increases in cord serum\nPCB levels during dredging, with significant declines in serum PCB\nlevels observed after dredging, particularly for the more volatile PCBs\nand PCB-118 (Table 5, Figure 2). The apparent differential effects of remediation on cord serum levels\nof various congeners are notable given possible congener-specific differences\nin toxicity. In addition to the previously described dredging associations, maternal\nconsumption of locally produced dairy products—an exposure risk\nfactor potentially related to the contaminated site—was associated\nwith higher cord serum PCB levels (Tables 2, 5). The most important predictor of elevated cord serum PCB levels was older\nmaternal age at the birth of the study infant. Older age is a well-established\nrisk factor for increased serum organochlorine concentrations, presumably\nas a consequence of cumulative exposure and temporal trends\nin exposure (Kutz et al. 1991). In multivariate models, we found that older maternal age and earlier\nbirth year were both associated with elevated cord blood PCB levels, indicating\nboth cumulative exposure and temporal trend effects. Mothers born in Portugal, the Azores, or Cape Verde had infants with substantially\nhigher cord serum PCB levels than mothers born in the United\nStates, Canada, or other countries, even after adjustment for diet\nor other lifestyle covariates that may vary by country of origin (Table 5). Although this observed association may be a chance finding or consequent\nto residual confounding by diet or lifestyle, it is also consistent\nwith potentially higher early-life exposure to PCBs resulting in higher\nserum levels during pregnancy. For example, PCB contamination is\npresent in fish species from southern Europe and the Atlantic Ocean along\nthe Azore Islands (Stefanelli et al. 2004). Higher early-life exposure to PCBs has been associated with higher serum\nlevels in adulthood among other populations (Rylander et al. 1997). We confirmed the previously reported association of prior lactation with\nlower serum PCB levels, which is likely due to PCB excretion in milk (Fitzgerald et al. 1998; Jensen 1991). Smoking during pregnancy was also associated with lower cord serum PCBs. Previous\nstudies have been inconsistent regarding the association\nof PCBs with smoking; maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated\nwith higher newborn PCB levels in one study (Lackman et al. 2000) but not in others (Fein et al. 1984; Rogan et al. 1986). Smoking may decrease organochlorine concentrations by enhancing their\nmetabolism via smoking-related induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes (Deutch and Hansen 1999; Zevin and Benowitz 1999). Long-term gardening was associated with lower cord serum PCBs (Table 3), opposite to the hypothesized effect. However, the small number of long-term\ngardeners (n = 9) suggests that chance and/or confounding may explain this\nfinding. Of note, the final multivariate model (Table 5) was unchanged by the addition of gardening (data not shown). In addition to these correlates of exposure, maternal consumption of organ\nmeat and local dairy products (Tables 2, 5) was associated with significantly higher cord blood PCB levels, but other\npotential dietary risks (including fish intake) were not. Although\nfish and animal products have been identified as important sources of\ngeneral population exposure to PCBs and dioxins in some studies (Laden et al. 1999; Patandin et al. 1999), levels of PCBs and dioxins in fish and other foods have been declining (Hays and Aylward 2003). Contaminated areas of the harbor were closed to fishing in 1979 (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 1995), 14 years before we started this study. A lack of association of local\nfish consumption with serum PCB levels is consistent with the lag between\nlast likely intake of the most contaminated fish and our exposure\nassessment. Other evaluated risk factors did not explain heterogeneity in cord serum\nPCB levels. Although serum concentrations of PCB-exposed workers are\nhigher than those of the general population (Wolff et al. 1982), the small number of mothers with potential occupational exposure limited\nthe statistical power to detect such associations. Furthermore, the\nage of study mothers was such that most of their occupational (and\nother) activities occurred after the ban on PCBs. Neighborhood socioeconomic status and age of housing were not associated\nwith increased cord PCB levels. Although manufacturers incorporated\nPCBs in building materials and light fixtures during a well-defined time\nperiod (Balfanz et al. 1993), house age was not a good predictor of indoor air PCB concentrations\nin previous studies in New Bedford (Vorhees et al. 1997). This measure does not capture renovations or other potential indoor\nPCB sources such as electrical appliances or fluorescent lights. Moreover, the\nneighborhood distribution of home ages is an imperfect proxy\nfor the age of the specific home of interest. Correlates of cord serum PCBs did not vary much by the different congener\ngroupings assessed. For example, the exposure pathways we observed\nfor the heavy PCBs and ∑PCBs were quite similar (Table 5). This is likely because the correlation of ∑PCB levels with heavy\nPCBs was much higher (r = 0.99) than with light PCBs (r = 0.76), consistent with the predominance of heavy PCBs in the\nsum. Except for diet, correlates of PCB TEQ exposure were also similar\nto other PCB concentration measures. Specifically, maternal consumption\nof red meat, but not organ meat, was associated with significantly\nhigher PCB TEQs. Patandin et al. (1999) also found meat to be a major contributor to dietary intake of PCB TEQs. Because\nthe congeners are weighted by dioxin-like activity, these findings\nprovide insights into the correlates of potential toxicity, about\nwhich very little is known. There are several limitations in the interpretation of our findings. First, the\nmedian serum PCB level in our cohort was about one-quarter of\nthe overall median in a recent review of 10 studies of PCBs and neurodevelopment (Longnecker et al. 2003). Despite this limitation, our findings corroborate previously established\ncorrelates of serum PCB levels, including age and secular trends. In\naddition, the use of simplified proxies for some exposure pathways\nlimited our ability to determine the relative contribution of various\nroutes of exposure to cord serum PCB levels. In particular, it could\nbe argued that residential distance from the site does not capture outdoor\nconcentrations because it ignores prevailing winds. However, the\nmaps of cord serum PCB levels and model residuals do not indicate any\nlikely wind-related spatial patterns with this region’s prevailing\nwind direction from the south-southwest (Cullen et al. 1996). In addition, it is possible that including household income and other\ndemographic variables reduced our ability to characterize exposure pathways\nby overadjusting for these indirect correlates of exposure. However, sensitivity\nanalyses demonstrated that this was not the case. For\nexample, results of our pathway analyses were not substantially changed\nby removing income from the model. Lastly, the cross-sectional nature\nof this analysis limits the certainty of inferences regarding the\nobserved temporal-and dredging-associated differences in serum PCB levels. In conclusion, our findings among New Bedford area infants suggest that\nmaternal residence near a Superfund site per se does not lead to higher\ncord serum PCB levels independent of other exposure risk factors, such\nas maternal age, birthplace, diet, previous lactation, pregnancy smoking, and\ninfant date of birth. However, there was evidence of an important\nlocal impact on exposure risk as shown by increased cord serum\nPCB levels in association with maternal local dairy consumption and lower\ncord serum PCB levels after site dredging.",
