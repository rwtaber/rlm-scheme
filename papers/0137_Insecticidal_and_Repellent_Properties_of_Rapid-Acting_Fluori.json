  "abstract": "The development of\nsafe and potent insecticides remains an integral\npart of a multifaceted strategy to effectively control human-disease-transmitting\ninsect vectors. Incorporating fluorine can dramatically alter the\nphysiochemical properties and bioavailability of insecticides. For\nexample, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-fluorophenyl)ethane (DFDT)—a\ndifluoro congener of trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)—was\ndemonstrated previously to be 10-fold less toxic to mosquitoes than\nDDT in terms of LD 50  values, but it exhibited a 4-fold\nfaster knockdown. Described herein is the discovery of fluorine-containing\n1-aryl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethan-1-ols (FTEs, for  f luorophenyl- t richloromethyl- e thanols). FTEs, particularly per-fluorophenyl-trichloromethyl-ethanol\n(PFTE), exhibited rapid knockdown not only against  Drosophila\nmelanogaster  but also against susceptible and resistant  Aedes aegypti  mosquitoes, major vectors of Dengue, Zika,\nyellow fever, and Chikungunya viruses. The  R  enantiomer\nof any chiral FTE, synthesized enantioselectively, exhibited faster\nknockdown than its corresponding  S  enantiomer. PFTE\ndoes not prolong the opening of mosquito sodium channels that are\ncharacteristic of the action of DDT and pyrethroid insecticides. In\naddition, pyrethroid/DDT-resistant  Ae. aegypti  strains\nhaving enhanced P450-mediated detoxification and/or carrying sodium\nchannel mutations that confer knockdown resistance were not cross-resistant\nto PFTE. These results indicate a mechanism of PFTE insecticidal action\ndistinct from that of pyrethroids or DDT. Furthermore, PFTE elicited\nspatial repellency at concentrations as low as 10 ppm in a hand-in-cage\nassay. PFTE and MFTE were found to possess low mammalian toxicity.\nThese results suggest the substantial potential of FTEs as a new class\nof compounds for controlling insect vectors, including pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nmosquitoes. Further investigations of FTE insecticidal and repellency\nmechanisms could provide important insights into how incorporation\nof fluorine influences the rapid lethality and mosquito sensing.",

      "text": "Following trends in medicinal chemistry, 1  many new fluorine-containing insecticides 2  and other pesticides 3 − 5  have been introduced\nin recent decades, facilitated\nby developments in fluoro-organic chemistry and motivated by the need\nto mitigate metabolic resistance. Representative fluorine-containing\ninsecticides across diverse structural classes include metofluthrin,\nbifenthrin, fipronil, flupyradifuron, and bistrifluoron, as well as\nthe pro-insecticide chlorfenapyr. The introduction of fluorine atoms\nand trifluoromethyl groups can significantly improve insecticide bioavailability\nby enhancing lipophilicity, cellular membrane permeability, metabolic\nstability (e.g., against cytochrome P450 enzymatic oxidations), and\nbinding affinity with minimal steric perturbation. 3 , 6 − 8\n\nMalariologists 9 , 10  have emphasized\nthe continuing\nneed for new, inexpensive, for indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated\nbed nets. Neonicotinoids,\nwhich were approved by the WHO in 2018 as a new class of insecticides\nfor combatting pyrethroid resistance, quickly faltered as resistance\ndeveloped, presumably a result of their heavy use in agriculture. 11  There is an urgent need for new chemical agents\nthat can mitigate vector-borne diseases and overcome resistant organisms.\n\nPreviously, we reinvestigated a difluoro congener of DDT, DFDT\n(1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-(bis(4,4′- fluorophenyl)ethane), 12  and its chiral monofluoro analog, MFDT 13  (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-(4-chlorophenyl)-(4-fluorophenyl)ethane). 9  DFDT acted more rapidly than DDT against  Drosophila  and  Anopheles quadrimaculatus , a vector of malaria, as well as  Aedes aegypti ,\na vector of Zika, Yellow fever, Dengue, and Chikungunya viruses. Despite\nthe fact that DFDT’s neurophysiological efficacy  in\nvitro  is 10-fold smaller than that of DDT, as well as the\nobservation that DDT and DFDT are cross-resistant, amorphous DFDT\nis approximately 4 times faster than amorphous DDT in knocking down  Aedes  and  Anopheles  mosquitoes. 14  This difference may be attributed to the fluorine-enhanced\nlipophilicity 15  and thus bioavailability\nof DFDT molecules traversing cuticle and cellular membranes. 6\n\nMajor insecticides used for public health\nare crystalline, with\ncontact action like that of DDT. 15  The\nspeed of action (knockdown time) of contact insecticides depends on\nthe release of molecules from the solid surface of the insecticide,\nfollowed by the penetration of molecules into the insect cuticle. 16  We have demonstrated that the speed of action\nof organochlorine, 17 , 18  organofluorine, 9  pyrethroid, 19  and neonicotinoid 20  insecticides can be increased in metastable\nsolid-state forms of a given compound. Metastable solid forms of the\nsame chemical compound have higher free energies, thereby surrendering\ntoxicant molecules from their surfaces more readily to insect tarsi\nupon contact. The differential lethality of polymorphs demonstrates\nthat the rate of uptake from the solid surface is consequential. For\ninstance, a commercial formulation of deltamethrin dispersed on chalk\nthat had been heated briefly to 120 °C killed 100% of various\nresistant mosquito strains from Burkina Faso, without exception, whereas\nthe commercial material as obtained was ineffective. 21  This increased activity was attributed to the heat-induced\ntransformation of commercial deltamethrin crystals to another crystalline\nform with a higher bioavailability. 19  The\nmore active form persists for 13 months and counting. 21  Crystalline polymorphs with faster uptake can remove resistant\norganisms from a population where slower uptake polymorphs are indifferent.\nFor this reason we\nhave focused on inexpensive\ncompounds that work quickly, especially as the WHO is moving toward\nnew antimalarial compounds with previously unexplored mechanisms of\naction. 22\n\nHaving synthesized MFDT\nand evaluated its enantioselectivity in\ninsect knockdown, we tested the synthetic intermediate 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol.\nHerein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of a group of related\nfluorine-containing 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol compounds, including\nper-fluorophenyl-trichloromethyl-ethanol (PFTE), with a particular\nfocus on their liquid, amorphous, and crystalline phases and the role\nof fluorine. We also examine the insecticidal and repellent actions\nof PFTE against  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes. Our findings\nindicate that fluorine-containing 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols\nare promising for combatting vector-borne human diseases."

      "text": "Given\nthat DFDT only has fluorine on its  para  positions,\nthe introduction of additional aromatic fluorine atoms may further\nimprove its knockdown speed. On the other hand, prior studies have\ndemonstrated that the insecticidal potency of DDT decreased substantially\nwhen the trichloromethyl group was replaced with a trifluoromethyl\ngroup, 23  or when the α-hydrogen was\nsubstituted by fluorine. 24  Based on these\nresults, we synthesized fluorinated DFDT congeners  2a – 2e  with aromatic fluorine substituents ( Figures  1  and  2 A, and  Supporting Information ). 25 , 26  In addition, one synthetic intermediate, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol\n( 1b ;  Figures  1  and  2 A), was reported to have one-\nto two-fifths of DDT’s insecticidal activity against fruit\nflies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) in contact residual\nexposure bioassays. 27  This active intermediate\ninspired the synthesis of compounds  1a  (PFTE) and  1c  with respective perfluoro- and trifluoromethyl-phenyl groups\n( Figures  1  and  2 A, and  Supporting Information ).\n\nSynthetic routes of compounds with various chemical moieties.\n\n(A) Chemical structure of selected compounds.

(C) Comparison of the KT 50  values.  2a ,  2b , and  2e  were liquid, whereas  2c  and  2d  were amorphous. Error bars represent\n95% confidence intervals (CI). Values with the same letter have overlapping\n95% CIs, and differences are considered insignificant. Knockdown–time\ncurves and logistic regression are available in the  Supporting Information .\n\nFigure  3  compares\nthe median knockdown time (KT 50 ) values for the compounds\ndiscussed throughout this paper. Because\nthe knockdown speed of insecticides is highly dependent on their condensed\nphases, 9 , 30 − 33  we prepared all compounds at\nroom temperature to best reflect their efficacy in the field. Compounds  1a  and  1c  were always monomorphic from the evaporation\nof various solvents or from the melt ( Figure  4 A,  Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ).  1b ,  2a ,  2b , and  2e  were liquid at room\ntemperature. Although  2c  and  2d  could grow\ninto crystals at room temperature ( Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ), their amorphous\nstates, which were prepared by supercooling melts or fine mist spraying\nof solutions, persisted for at least 20 days at room temperature and\nwere used for lethality measurements. Each crystalline form was ground\ninto particles with sizes (50 μm) comparable to those of amorphous\nor liquid particles prepared by fine mist spraying. Female  Drosophila melanogaster , an accepted proxy for evaluating\ninsecticide potency against mosquitoes, 28  were placed in Petri dishes and exposed to 2.0 mg (10.6 μg/cm 2 ) of all compounds in  Figure  2 A in their amorphous, crystalline, or liquid forms.\nThe experimental procedure was similar to that previously reported\nby our laboratory. 9 , 32  The DDT crystalline polymorph\ndesignated Form I, 30  the DFDT crystalline\npolymorph also designated Form I, amorphous DFDT ( a -DFDT), 9  and deltamethrin (DM, a leading\npyrethroid 29 ) likewise Form I 32  were used for comparison ( a -DFDT and DM were known for their rapid knockdown properties). Knockdown\ntimes were analyzed by measuring the motion of flies recorded with\na video camera. The KT 50  values, here the median knockdown\ntimes for a fly population, were calculated by performing logistic\nregression analysis of knockdown–time curves ( Table S2 ). 30  The KT 50  values decreased in the order DDT-I (261 min) >  1c  (168\nmin) > DFDT-I (152 min) >  a -DFDT (54 min) >  1a  (36 min) > DM-I (30 min) ≈  1b  (29\nmin)\n( Figure  2 B,C). Liquid  1b  was comparable to DM Form I in lethality, although the\nuptake of molecules from liquid would be expected to be more rapid\nthan that from crystals. 31  Notably, crystalline  1a  and  1c  both exhibited rapid knockdown, and\nthe former was even faster in action than amorphous DFDT. In contrast,  2a – 2e , whether in their amorphous or liquid\nforms, were all less active than  a -DFDT ( Figure  2 C and  Figure S3 ). These results suggested that the\nfluorination of 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol is a viable strategy\nfor the discovery of rapid-acting agents.\n\nStructure–activity\nrelationships. (A–D) Compounds\nwith various chemical moieties. KT 50  (min) for  D. melanogaster  are denoted in parentheses. Physical states\nare denoted by color: crystals, orange; liquid, blue. Values with\nthe same letter have overlapping 95% confidence intervals, and differences\nare considered insignificant. Knockdown–time curves and logistic\nregression are available in the  Supporting Information . (E) Chemical structure of compounds with good knockdown properties.\n\n(A)  1a  crystallized into conglomerates with\na chiral  P 2 1  space group. The enantiomers\ncould not be\nseparated from the conglomerates and were instead prepared by the\nasymmetric synthesis shown in  Figure  2 . Atom colors: hydrogen, white; carbon, gray; fluorine,\nmagenta; chlorine, green. (B) Fluorinated compounds shown in  Figure  3 A, except  1a .  1f  crystallized as a racemate with a  P 1  space group (shown as an example). Other crystal\nstructures are available in the  Supporting Information . The apparently skewed unit cell is a consequence of a perspective\nview along a general direction. (C) Similar to  1a , enantiomers\nof  1b  prepared by the asymmetric synthesis shown in  Figure  2 .\n\nStructure–activity\nrelationship (SAR) studies were performed on  1a – 1c  to determine the key functionalities or moieties that may\ninfluence the insecticidal activity of 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol.\nCompounds  1d – 1z ,  4 – 6  with various chemical moieties were synthesized ( Figure  1  and  Supporting Information ), and their individual\nknockdown times against female  Drosophila  were evaluated\nat 10.6 μg/cm 2  ( Figure  3 ,  Figures S4 and S5 , and  Table S2 ). Female  Drosophila  in control groups typically began to become immobilized after 720\nmin; thus, compounds with KT 50  values >720 min were\nconsidered\ninactive.\n\nSAR studies revealed that aromatic substituents significantly\naffected lethality ( Figure  3 A). 1-Phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols that contain aromatic\nsubstituents of F ( 1a ,  1b ,  1d – 1i ), OCF 3  ( 1k ), CF 3  ( 1c ,  1j ,  1s ), and\na mixture of two fluorine functionalities ( 1q ,  1r ) exhibited rapid knockdown. In general, the ability of\naromatic substituents to improve knockdown decreased in the order\nF > OCF 3  > CF 3 . Aromatic fluorine substituents\nsubstantially influenced the physiochemical properties of compounds\nas well. Most compounds with  ortho  or  para  substituents were crystalline at room temperature, and their crystals\nwere each prepared in their thermodynamically stable forms for lethality\nmeasurements ( Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ). In contrast,  meta  substituents or the addition of the flexible OCF 3  substituent\ndecreased the melting points of some compounds to the extent that\nthey were liquids at room temperature. Compounds  1a  and  1b  were respectively the fastest-acting crystalline and liquid\ncompounds. Additionally, aromatic substituents with various steric\nand electronic effects were compared. Compounds that contain common\nelectron-donating ( 1m ,  1p ) or -withdrawing\n( 1n ,  1o ) groups were inactive. The switch\nfrom an OCF 3  ( 1k ) group to an SCF 3  ( 1l ) group, or from phenyl ( 1b ,  1c ) to other fluorinated aromatic systems ( 1t ,  1y ), led to a loss of activity. Moreover, the introduction\nof Cl ( 1z ), Br ( 1v ,  1x ), CH 3  ( 1u ), or OPh ( 1w ) substituent to\nfluoro- or trifluoromethylphenyl groups resulted in a significant\nlowering of activity.\n\nFollowing the SAR studies for aromatic\nsubstituents, we investigated\nthe effects of three moieties that were attached to the central carbon\natom. Acetoxylation led to a loss of activity, corroborating the importance\nof free alcohol in conferring lethality ( Figure  3 B). In contrast, the switch from H ( 1a ) to CH 3  ( 5 ) substituent had little\neffect on knockdown speed ( Figure  3 C). A −CH 3  substituent, however,\nprevented the crystallization of compound  5  at room temperature.\nThe impact of halogenated methyl groups was also probed by changing\nthe halogen ( Figure  3 D). CCl 3  ( 1c ) was superior to both CF 3  ( 7 ) and CBr 3  ( 6 ) substituents,\npresumably due to steric effects. In conclusion, the SAR studies showed\nthat 1-aryl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols and -propanols containing one\nor more aromatic substituents of F, OCF 3 , or CF 3  exhibited remarkable knockdown properties ( Figure  3 E).\n\nThe stereoisomers\nof a given insecticide may have different activities due to their\nunique interactions with the metabolic enzymes or the target site. 40  For example, our previous studies demonstrated\nthat the monofluoro congener of DDT—named MFDT—exhibited\nenantioselective lethality against  Drosophila . 9  Moreover, different insecticide stereoisomers\nmay have different environmental impacts. 32  Thus, single or enriched stereoisomer formulations of insecticides\nare preferable, because they can have both increased potency and reduced\nenvironmental impact. 33  We explored the\ndifference in the activity of enantiomers of  1a  and  1b , because their degrees of fluorination are on opposite\nends of the spectrum.\n\nInterestingly, racemic  1a  always crystallized as conglomerates 34  (a mixture of homochiral enantiomer crystals) in the  P 2 1  space group from solution or from melts ( Figure  4 A). In contrast, other racemates\ndisplayed in  Figure  3  all crystallized as racemates 47  (equimolar\namounts of enantiomers in the crystal lattices;  Figure  4 B and  Figure S2 ). Since the crystals in conglomerates of  1a  were tiny\nneedles (<100 μm), the separation of enantiomer crystals\nbased on crystal morphology (a Pasteur-like resolution) was not feasible.\nInstead, we prepared the enantiomers via asymmetric synthesis. Racemates\nwere oxidized to yield ketones, 35  which\nwere reduced by catecholborane in the presence of chiral oxazaborolidine\ncatalysts 36  to yield  1a  and  1b  enantiomers, each having 99% and 95% enantiomeric excess\n( Figure  1 , and  Supporting Information ). The absolute configuration\nof the  1a  enantiomers was assigned using single-crystal\nX-ray analysis ( Figure  4 A, and  Supporting Information ).\n\nFemale  Drosophila  were exposed to racemates and\nenantiomers of both crystalline  1a  and liquid  1b  at various dosages. The  R  forms of  1a  and  1b  were always faster-acting than their respective  S  forms ( Figure  5 A–E and  Table S2 ), suggesting\nenantioselectivity in insect uptake, metabolism, or neurotoxicity.\n( R )- 1a  was even faster-acting than DM\nForm I at very low dosages ( Figure  5 F and  Figure S6 ). In contrast,\nboth enantiomers of  1b  were less effective (KT 50  > 720 min) at 0.53 μg/cm 2 , requiring higher\nlethal\ndoses than of  1a . Therefore, the rapid knockdown speeds\nof  1b  and other figures shown for  Figure  3  are presumably dominated by the kinetics\nof uptake of molecules.\n\n(A–E) Knockdown of  1a  enantiomers\n(crystals)\nand  1b  enantiomers (liquid) against  D. melanogaster  at various\ndosages. At 0.53 μg/cm 2 , both  1b  enantiomers\nhad KT 50  values >720 min. The median knockdown time\nfor\neach curve is denoted by its intersection with the horizontal KT 50  marker. (F) KT 50  values versus dosage. Error\nbars represent 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\nTo determine whether PFTE induces rapid knockdown of mosquitoes,\nwe conducted a contact-based bioassay as described above for flies.\nAdult females of an insecticide-susceptible wild-type  Ae.\naegypti  strain, Rockefeller, were all knocked down in less\nthan 5 min upon contact exposure to PFTE at the concentration of 12.5\nμg/cm 2 . Furthermore, we observed 77% mortality after\nRockefeller mosquitoes were exposed to vapor emitted from PFTE of\n12.5 μg/cm 2  for 24 h ( Figure S1 ).\n\nGiven that PFTE induced very rapid knockdown at\n12.5 μg/cm 2 , we also conducted the contact bioassay\nusing 1.25 μg/cm 2  and recorded the percentage of\nknockdown over the course of 1 h ( Figure  6 ). Next, we examined two pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nstrains, KDR:ROCK 37  and Puerto Rico, 38  which carry different sodium channel mutations\nthat confer knockdown resistance (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroids. 37 , 39  The Puerto Rico strain also possesses an enhanced P450-mediated\nmetabolic detoxification mechanism of resistance. 38  As shown in  Figure  6 , the KT 50  values of PFTE against these pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nmosquitoes were not significantly different from those against the\nsusceptible mosquitoes, although KDR:ROCK mosquitoes were more sensitive\nto PFTE than Puerto Rico mosquitoes. These results show that, unlike\nin the case of DFDT, 28  there is no cross-resistance\nbetween PFTE, DDT, and pyrethroids. Further, our functional examination\nof mosquito sodium channels expressed in  Xenopus  oocytes\nindicates that, unlike pyrethroids and DDT, PFTE does not alter the\ngating of mosquito sodium channels ( Figure S2 ).\n\nKnockdown of  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes by crystalline\nPFTE. At the dosage of 1.25 μg/cm 2 , PFTE had KT 50  values of 15, 10, and 20 min for Rockefeller, KDR:ROCK and\nPuerto Rico mosquitoes, respectively. The median knockdown time for\neach curve is denoted by its intersection with the horizontal KT 50  dotted line. Curves with the same letter do not differ according\nto Log-Rank test, and dots denote the value of each biological replicate\n(mosquito). Rockefeller vs KDR:ROCK: Log Rank: χ 2  = 3.11,  df  = 1,  P  = 0.08; Rockefeller\nvs Puerto Rico: Log Rank: χ 2  = 3.22,  df  = 1,  P  = 0.073. KDR:ROCK vs Puerto Rico: χ 2  = 13.13,  df  = 1,  P  <\n0.001.\n\nThese results indicate that PFTE\nmay have unique target sites in\nthe nervous system. An observation that may be related is that the\nmiticide dicofol (2,2,2-trichloro-1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol),\nin which the α-carbon of DDT is hydroxylated, has a different\nmechanism of action than that of DDT itself. 40  It is indifferent to houseflies with DDT-related kdr, and it elicits\ndifferent symptoms of poisoning in susceptible flies, e.g., the absence\nof tremors. Subsequent research indicated that it may inhibit the\noctopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase enzyme. 41\n\nFuture studies using various nerve preparations are\nneeded to elucidate\nthe mechanism of PFTE action. Its perfluorination may not be subjected\nto detoxification by cytochrome P450 enzymes, but other metabolic\ndetoxification pathways, such as glucuronidation, are still possible.\nThe remarkably rapid knockdown by PFTE might be primarily attributed\nto the fact that fluorine significantly increases the lipophilicity,\nand thus bioavailability, of PFTE molecules, which are expected to\nrapidly traverse insect cuticle and cellular membranes.\n\nThe finding of PFTE vapor toxicity against  Ae. aegypti  prompted us to determine whether PFTE evokes spatial (noncontact)\nrepellency using a hand-in-cage assay, 42  as shown in  Figure  7 . PFTE was diluted in acetone and applied on a polyester netting\n(6.5 cm × 5.5 cm). After the acetone fully evaporated, the netting\nwas fixed in a modified glove worn by a tester. Groups of female Rockefeller\nmosquitoes were exposed to PFTE vapor for 5 min at concentrations\nranging from 10 to 10000 ppm. The repellency indexes at each concentration\nand control were determined by comparing the number of landings of\nmosquitoes in two trials: in a first trial with acetone-treated netting\nonly and a second trial with PFTE-treated netting (see details in\nref ( 42 )). When the\nmosquitoes were exposed to PFTE-treated netting, significantly fewer\nlandings were observed. The repellency by PFTE vapor was dose-dependent\nand observed at concentrations as low as 10 ppm of PFTE ( Figure  7 B). No mosquitoes\nwere knocked down or exhibited locomotive modifications during the\nnoncontact assay at all tested concentrations.\n\nPFTE elicits spatial\nrepellency in  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes.

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Dots over the\nbars represent individual replicate values. ns = not significant,\n** P  < 0.01, *** P  < 0.001.\n\nWe showed in a recent study that activation of\nvoltage-gated sodium\nchannels alone by transfluthrin, a volatile pyrethroid, was sufficient\nto elicit spatial repellency in  Ae. aegypti  and that\nkdr mutations in sodium channels reduced transfluthrin repellency. 43  Here, we found that KDR:ROCK mosquitoes exhibited\nsimilar levels of repellency compared to wild-type Rockefeller mosquitoes\nwhen exposed to PFTE ( Figure  7 D). This result indicates that, unlike transfluthrin repellency,\nthe kdr mutations did not affect repellency by PFTE, consistent with\nour toxicity results from contact assays ( Figure  6 ). Taken together, our findings indicate\nthat the mechanism of PFTE repellency is different from that of transfluthrin\nrepellency and appears to be independent of sodium channel activation.\n\nGiven that spatial repellency can be elicited by compounds that\nactivate odorant receptors in mosquitoes’ antennae, 42 , 44  we examined whether PFTE repellency is mediated by activation of\nodorant receptor (Or) using an  Ae. aegypti  mutant\nstrain in which the odorant receptor co-receptor gene ( orco ) was mutated. 45  Orco is required for\nOr-mediated olfactory activities, and the null mutation of  orco  resulted in impaired Or-mediated olfactory pathways. 45  We found that PFTE repellency was not reduced\nin orco –/–  mosquitoes compared with wild-type\n(Orlando) mosquitoes. PFTE at 1000 ppm evoked around 70% repellency\nin both mosquito strains ( Figure  7 D).

Because\nthe knockdown speed of insecticides is highly dependent on their condensed\nphases, 9 , 30 − 33  we prepared all compounds at\nroom temperature to best reflect their efficacy in the field. Compounds  1a  and  1c  were always monomorphic from the evaporation\nof various solvents or from the melt ( Figure  4 A,  Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ).  1b ,  2a ,  2b , and  2e  were liquid at room\ntemperature. Although  2c  and  2d  could grow\ninto crystals at room temperature ( Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ), their amorphous\nstates, which were prepared by supercooling melts or fine mist spraying\nof solutions, persisted for at least 20 days at room temperature and\nwere used for lethality measurements. Each crystalline form was ground\ninto particles with sizes (50 μm) comparable to those of amorphous\nor liquid particles prepared by fine mist spraying. Female  Drosophila melanogaster , an accepted proxy for evaluating\ninsecticide potency against mosquitoes, 28  were placed in Petri dishes and exposed to 2.0 mg (10.6 μg/cm 2 ) of all compounds in  Figure  2 A in their amorphous, crystalline, or liquid forms.\nThe experimental procedure was similar to that previously reported\nby our laboratory. 9 , 32  The DDT crystalline polymorph\ndesignated Form I, 30  the DFDT crystalline\npolymorph also designated Form I, amorphous DFDT ( a -DFDT), 9  and deltamethrin (DM, a leading\npyrethroid 29 ) likewise Form I 32  were used for comparison ( a -DFDT and DM were known for their rapid knockdown properties). Knockdown\ntimes were analyzed by measuring the motion of flies recorded with\na video camera. The KT 50  values, here the median knockdown\ntimes for a fly population, were calculated by performing logistic\nregression analysis of knockdown–time curves ( Table S2 ). 30  The KT 50  values decreased in the order DDT-I (261 min) >  1c  (168\nmin) > DFDT-I (152 min) >  a -DFDT (54 min) >  1a  (36 min) > DM-I (30 min) ≈  1b  (29\nmin)\n( Figure  2 B,C). Liquid  1b  was comparable to DM Form I in lethality, although the\nuptake of molecules from liquid would be expected to be more rapid\nthan that from crystals. 31  Notably, crystalline  1a  and  1c  both exhibited rapid knockdown, and\nthe former was even faster in action than amorphous DFDT. In contrast,  2a – 2e , whether in their amorphous or liquid\nforms, were all less active than  a -DFDT ( Figure  2 C and  Figure S3 ).

      "text": "Structure–activity\nrelationship (SAR) studies were performed on  1a – 1c  to determine the key functionalities or moieties that may\ninfluence the insecticidal activity of 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol.\nCompounds  1d – 1z ,  4 – 6  with various chemical moieties were synthesized ( Figure  1  and  Supporting Information ), and their individual\nknockdown times against female  Drosophila  were evaluated\nat 10.6 μg/cm 2  ( Figure  3 ,  Figures S4 and S5 , and  Table S2 ). Female  Drosophila  in control groups typically began to become immobilized after 720\nmin; thus, compounds with KT 50  values >720 min were\nconsidered\ninactive.\n\nSAR studies revealed that aromatic substituents significantly\naffected lethality ( Figure  3 A). 1-Phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols that contain aromatic\nsubstituents of F ( 1a ,  1b ,  1d – 1i ), OCF 3  ( 1k ), CF 3  ( 1c ,  1j ,  1s ), and\na mixture of two fluorine functionalities ( 1q ,  1r ) exhibited rapid knockdown. In general, the ability of\naromatic substituents to improve knockdown decreased in the order\nF > OCF 3  > CF 3 . Aromatic fluorine substituents\nsubstantially influenced the physiochemical properties of compounds\nas well. Most compounds with  ortho  or  para  substituents were crystalline at room temperature, and their crystals\nwere each prepared in their thermodynamically stable forms for lethality\nmeasurements ( Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ). In contrast,  meta  substituents or the addition of the flexible OCF 3  substituent\ndecreased the melting points of some compounds to the extent that\nthey were liquids at room temperature. Compounds  1a  and  1b  were respectively the fastest-acting crystalline and liquid\ncompounds. Additionally, aromatic substituents with various steric\nand electronic effects were compared. Compounds that contain common\nelectron-donating ( 1m ,  1p ) or -withdrawing\n( 1n ,  1o ) groups were inactive. The switch\nfrom an OCF 3  ( 1k ) group to an SCF 3  ( 1l ) group, or from phenyl ( 1b ,  1c ) to other fluorinated aromatic systems ( 1t ,  1y ), led to a loss of activity. Moreover, the introduction\nof Cl ( 1z ), Br ( 1v ,  1x ), CH 3  ( 1u ), or OPh ( 1w ) substituent to\nfluoro- or trifluoromethylphenyl groups resulted in a significant\nlowering of activity.\n\nFollowing the SAR studies for aromatic\nsubstituents, we investigated\nthe effects of three moieties that were attached to the central carbon\natom. Acetoxylation led to a loss of activity, corroborating the importance\nof free alcohol in conferring lethality ( Figure  3 B). In contrast, the switch from H ( 1a ) to CH 3  ( 5 ) substituent had little\neffect on knockdown speed ( Figure  3 C). A −CH 3  substituent, however,\nprevented the crystallization of compound  5  at room temperature.\nThe impact of halogenated methyl groups was also probed by changing\nthe halogen ( Figure  3 D). CCl 3  ( 1c ) was superior to both CF 3  ( 7 ) and CBr 3  ( 6 ) substituents,\npresumably due to steric effects. In conclusion, the SAR studies showed\nthat 1-aryl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols and -propanols containing one\nor more aromatic substituents of F, OCF 3 , or CF 3  exhibited remarkable knockdown properties ( Figure  3 E)."

In contrast, other racemates\ndisplayed in  Figure  3  all crystallized as racemates 47  (equimolar\namounts of enantiomers in the crystal lattices;  Figure  4 B and  Figure S2 ). Since the crystals in conglomerates of  1a  were tiny\nneedles (<100 μm), the separation of enantiomer crystals\nbased on crystal morphology (a Pasteur-like resolution) was not feasible.\nInstead, we prepared the enantiomers via asymmetric synthesis.

      "title": "Toxicity of PFTE against  Aedes aegypti  Mosquitoes",
      "text": "To determine whether PFTE induces rapid knockdown of mosquitoes,\nwe conducted a contact-based bioassay as described above for flies.\nAdult females of an insecticide-susceptible wild-type  Ae.\naegypti  strain, Rockefeller, were all knocked down in less\nthan 5 min upon contact exposure to PFTE at the concentration of 12.5\nμg/cm 2 . Furthermore, we observed 77% mortality after\nRockefeller mosquitoes were exposed to vapor emitted from PFTE of\n12.5 μg/cm 2  for 24 h ( Figure S1 ).\n\nGiven that PFTE induced very rapid knockdown at\n12.5 μg/cm 2 , we also conducted the contact bioassay\nusing 1.25 μg/cm 2  and recorded the percentage of\nknockdown over the course of 1 h ( Figure  6 ). Next, we examined two pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nstrains, KDR:ROCK 37  and Puerto Rico, 38  which carry different sodium channel mutations\nthat confer knockdown resistance (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroids. 37 , 39  The Puerto Rico strain also possesses an enhanced P450-mediated\nmetabolic detoxification mechanism of resistance. 38  As shown in  Figure  6 , the KT 50  values of PFTE against these pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nmosquitoes were not significantly different from those against the\nsusceptible mosquitoes, although KDR:ROCK mosquitoes were more sensitive\nto PFTE than Puerto Rico mosquitoes. These results show that, unlike\nin the case of DFDT, 28  there is no cross-resistance\nbetween PFTE, DDT, and pyrethroids. Further, our functional examination\nof mosquito sodium channels expressed in  Xenopus  oocytes\nindicates that, unlike pyrethroids and DDT, PFTE does not alter the\ngating of mosquito sodium channels ( Figure S2 ).\n\nKnockdown of  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes by crystalline\nPFTE. At the dosage of 1.25 μg/cm 2 , PFTE had KT 50  values of 15, 10, and 20 min for Rockefeller, KDR:ROCK and\nPuerto Rico mosquitoes, respectively.

KDR:ROCK vs Puerto Rico: χ 2  = 13.13,  df  = 1,  P  <\n0.001.\n\nThese results indicate that PFTE\nmay have unique target sites in\nthe nervous system. An observation that may be related is that the\nmiticide dicofol (2,2,2-trichloro-1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol),\nin which the α-carbon of DDT is hydroxylated, has a different\nmechanism of action than that of DDT itself. 40  It is indifferent to houseflies with DDT-related kdr, and it elicits\ndifferent symptoms of poisoning in susceptible flies, e.g., the absence\nof tremors. Subsequent research indicated that it may inhibit the\noctopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase enzyme. 41\n\nFuture studies using various nerve preparations are\nneeded to elucidate\nthe mechanism of PFTE action. Its perfluorination may not be subjected\nto detoxification by cytochrome P450 enzymes, but other metabolic\ndetoxification pathways, such as glucuronidation, are still possible.\nThe remarkably rapid knockdown by PFTE might be primarily attributed\nto the fact that fluorine significantly increases the lipophilicity,\nand thus bioavailability, of PFTE molecules, which are expected to\nrapidly traverse insect cuticle and cellular membranes."

Groups of female Rockefeller\nmosquitoes were exposed to PFTE vapor for 5 min at concentrations\nranging from 10 to 10000 ppm. The repellency indexes at each concentration\nand control were determined by comparing the number of landings of\nmosquitoes in two trials: in a first trial with acetone-treated netting\nonly and a second trial with PFTE-treated netting (see details in\nref ( 42 )). When the\nmosquitoes were exposed to PFTE-treated netting, significantly fewer\nlandings were observed. The repellency by PFTE vapor was dose-dependent\nand observed at concentrations as low as 10 ppm of PFTE ( Figure  7 B).

This result indicates that, unlike transfluthrin repellency,\nthe kdr mutations did not affect repellency by PFTE, consistent with\nour toxicity results from contact assays ( Figure  6 ). Taken together, our findings indicate\nthat the mechanism of PFTE repellency is different from that of transfluthrin\nrepellency and appears to be independent of sodium channel activation.\n\nGiven that spatial repellency can be elicited by compounds that\nactivate odorant receptors in mosquitoes’ antennae, 42 , 44  we examined whether PFTE repellency is mediated by activation of\nodorant receptor (Or) using an  Ae. aegypti  mutant\nstrain in which the odorant receptor co-receptor gene ( orco ) was mutated. 45  Orco is required for\nOr-mediated olfactory activities, and the null mutation of  orco  resulted in impaired Or-mediated olfactory pathways. 45  We found that PFTE repellency was not reduced\nin orco –/–  mosquitoes compared with wild-type\n(Orlando) mosquitoes. PFTE at 1000 ppm evoked around 70% repellency\nin both mosquito strains ( Figure  7 D). Our findings suggest that spatial repellency by\nPFTE is not mediated by activation of odorant receptors.\n\nCompared\nwith other compounds that were recently tested against\nRockefeller mosquitoes in the hand-in-cage assay, the potency of PFTE\nin eliciting spatial repellency is comparable to those of plant-derived\ncompounds, but lower than those of DEET and volatile pyrethroids. 46 − 48  For instance, eucalyptol and camphor elicited 50–60% repellency\nat 100 ppm.

The X-ray intensity data were recorded on a Bruker D8\nAPEX-II CCD system using graphite-monochromated and 0.5 mm MonoCap-collimated\nMo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) with the ω\nscan method at 100 K. The selected crystallographic parameters are\nlisted in  Table S1 . Crystallographic information\nfiles (CIFs), including the HKL and RES data, are deposited in the\nCCDC with numbers 2102296 (( R )- 1a ),\n2102297 (( S )- 1a ), 2102298 ( 1c ), 2102299 ( 1e ), 2102300 ( 1f ), 2102301\n( 1h ), 2102302 ( 1i ), 2102303 ( 2c ), and 2102304 ( 2d ).\n\nThe lethality of solid-state forms\nof insecticide was determined by the residual exposure method. Each\ncrystalline form was ground to a particle size similar to the size\nof the amorphous or liquid droplets prepared by fine mist spraying.\nFor  D. melanogaster  flies, lethality measurements\nwere performed in duplicate for each compound, each accompanied by\ntwo controls (no insecticide). Each microcrystalline form was added\nto a 10 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish, which was subsequently\nshaken to disperse the microcrystals throughout the Petri dish. Amorphous\nor liquid forms were prepared by fine mist spraying a hexane stock\nsolution, with various concentrations in 10 mL hexane, onto the top\nand bottom of 10 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dishes (two sprays\n= 0.280 mL) and allowing the hexane to evaporate at room temperature.\nFlies were sedated with carbon dioxide (for 30 s), and 25 females\nwere transferred to each Petri dish. The top of the dish was then\nplaced over the bottom, and the motion of the flies was recorded with\na video camera (Sony HDR-CX455). The knockdown time was measured for\neach individual fly, with knockdown associated with an insect laying\non the bottom surface of the Petri dish in a supine position without\nmoving from its original position after 10 s.\n\nFor  Ae.\naegypti  mosquitoes, lethality measurements were performed\nin similar conditions as described for flies.  1a  microcrystalline\nform (ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg) was added to a 9 cm diameter polystyrene\nPetri dish, which was subsequently shaken to disperse the microcrystals\nthroughout the Petri dish, providing concentrations that ranged from\n1.25 to 12.5 μg/cm 2 . Twenty (4–9 days old)\nfemale mosquitoes were sedated with carbon dioxide (for 20 s) and\ntransferred to the 9 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish which was\nthen covered with a lid to prevent their escape. Three Petri dishes\ncontaining 20 female mosquitoes each (replicates) were used, totaling\n60 mosquitoes for each strain. The number of mosquitoes that were\nknocked down (i.e., an insect laying on the bottom surface of the\nPetri dish in a supine position without moving from its original position\nafter 10 s) was recorded every 5 min (for 40 min). For the vapor toxicity\nassay we used 1.0 mg of  1a  microcrystalline form, which\nwas subsequently shaken to disperse the microcrystals throughout the\nPetri dish, providing concentrations of 12.5 μg/cm 2 . On top of the treated Petri dish a second modified Petri dish was\nplaced. For that, a 9 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish with a 7\ncm diameter hole was used to create a window, and a polyester netting\n(Shason Textile Inc., part number WSB532-111, white; 8.0 cm of diameter)\nwas fixed in the bottom of the modified Petri dish to prevent mosquitoes\nfrom making direct contact with the compound. This setup allowed the\nmosquitoes to be exposed to the vapor phase of compound  1a  only ( Figure  7 B).\nTwenty (4–9 days old) female mosquitoes were sedated with carbon\ndioxide (for 20 s) and transferred to the modified Petri dish which\nwas then covered with a lid to prevent their escape. Five replicates\n(i.e., modified Petri dishes containing 20 female mosquitoes each)\nwere used. The mortality was evaluated after 24 h of exposure.\n\nWe evaluated whether compound  1a  possesses\npyrethroid and DDT-like activities on the mosquito\nwild-type sodium channel (AaNa v 1-1). AaNa v 1-1\nchannels were expressed in  Xenopus  oocytes and functionally\ncharacterized using a two-electrode voltage clamp as previously described. 54 , 55  Briefly, the tail-current induced by compound  1a  and\ndeltamethrin (positive control) following a 100-pulse train of 5 ms\ndepolarization from −120 mV to 0 mV with 10 ms was measured. 56  We also tested the inhibitory effect of  1a  on channel inactivation in the DDT protocol 57  by measuring the remaining current at the end\nof a 500 ms depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential\nof −120 mV. For this protocol cells were previously incubated\nfor 3–4 h in 100 μM PFTE. Six oocytes (i.e., six replicates)\nexpressing AaNa v 1-1 were tested for both control (i.e.,\nDMSO) and compound  1a .\n\nWe assessed the spatial (i.e., noncontact)\nrepellency elicited by compound  1a  using a hand-in-cage\nassay. 42  Briefly, a human hand wearing\na modified nitrile glove (Ansell Protective Products, part number\n37-155) was placed inside a 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm mosquito\ncage (BioQuip) with a digital camera (e-con Systems Inc., model e-CAM51A)\nmounted on its top. The camera was connected to a laptop computer\nto record mosquito landings. 42  The nitrile\nrubber glove\nworn by a tester\nwas cut on its back to create a window (6 cm × 5 cm). A rectangular\n(6.5 cm × 5.5 cm) magnetic frame was glued onto the cut window,\nwhich served as a base for\nstacking additional magnetic window frames. One piece of test-compound-treated\npolyester netting (Shason Textile Inc., part number WS-B532-111, Walmart\nno. 567948282, white; slightly larger than the dimension of the window,\nbut smaller than the outer edge dimensions of the magnetic frames)\nwas placed on this fixed magnetic frame, which was ∼3.0 mm\nabove the glove and hand. To the compound-treated netting was applied\n500 μL of either solvent (acetone) or test compound (PFTE) in\na glass Petri dish, in an adjacent room. After acetone was fully evaporated\n(approximately 7 min), the netting was assembled into the window created\nin the glove. The hand makes no contact with the treated netting.\nThe second piece of the netting was untreated and was placed ∼8.0\nmm above the treated netting using a stack of four magnetic frames.\nThe stacked magnetic frames were further secured with two binder clips.\nThe stacking creates sufficient space between the treated netting\nand the untreated netting so that mosquitoes that land on the open\nwindow were not able to contact the treated netting or contact and\npierce the skin of the hand in the glove. Eighteen hours before the\nassay, 4- to 9-day-old female mosquitoes\n(about 40, mated, non-blood-fed) were transferred into each cage.\nGroups of 40 female mosquitoes were exposed for 4 min to PFTE at different\ndilutions ranging from 10 to 10 000 ppm, which correspond to\n0.14, 1.4, 14.0, and 140 μg/cm 2 . The cages were kept\nunder controlled conditions inside an environmental growth chamber\n(27 °C, relative humidity of ∼55%, and 12 h photoperiod).\nA cotton ball soaked with distilled water was placed on the top of\neach cage. Any cage that gave a low landing number (i.e., <50%\nof the average landing compared with other cages) in the first run\nwas not continued with the second run. Repellency index was calculated\nusing the following equation: Percentage repellency = [1 –\n(cumulative number of landings on the window of treatment/cumulative\nnumber of landings on the window of solvent treatment)] × 100).\nFor each concentration or mosquito strain we used at least five cages\n(i.e., 5 replicates).\n\nThe rat oral\ntoxicity test was\nconducted at Envigo CRS GmbH, Germany, according to the OECD guideline\nfor the fixed dose procedure, 42  using female\nadults of the Wistar Ham strain. The test compounds were formulated\nat concentrations of 30 and 200 mg/mL in corn oil and administered\nat a constant dose volume of 10 mL/kg body weight. Clinical observations\nand inspections for morbidity/mortality were performed at least three\ntimes within the first 6 h after application, thereafter at least\nonce daily for 14 days. If a rat displayed a high state of pain or\ndistress, it was considered to be not surviving the treatment and\nwas sacrificed immediately.\n\nLogistic regression\nof knockdown–time\ncurves was preformed to obtain the median knockdown time (KT 50 ) of the test flies and mosquitoes, the 95% confidence intervals\n(CI), slopes, and standard errors (SE) using Qcal software. 41  To evaluate the mosquito knockdown time we used\nthe survival analysis and estimated the median lethal time (i.e.,\nKT 50 ) applying Kaplan–Meier estimators (Log-rank\nmethod) available in SigmaPlot 12.0 (Systat 218 Software, San Jose,\nCalifornia, USA). For the repellency data unpaired Student’s  t  tests were used to compare two sets of data. All statistical\nanalyses and figure plotting were done using SigmaPlot v.12.5 (Systat\nSoftware)."

  "full_text": "The development of\nsafe and potent insecticides remains an integral\npart of a multifaceted strategy to effectively control human-disease-transmitting\ninsect vectors. Incorporating fluorine can dramatically alter the\nphysiochemical properties and bioavailability of insecticides. For\nexample, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-fluorophenyl)ethane (DFDT)—a\ndifluoro congener of trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)—was\ndemonstrated previously to be 10-fold less toxic to mosquitoes than\nDDT in terms of LD 50  values, but it exhibited a 4-fold\nfaster knockdown. Described herein is the discovery of fluorine-containing\n1-aryl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethan-1-ols (FTEs, for  f luorophenyl- t richloromethyl- e thanols). FTEs, particularly per-fluorophenyl-trichloromethyl-ethanol\n(PFTE), exhibited rapid knockdown not only against  Drosophila\nmelanogaster  but also against susceptible and resistant  Aedes aegypti  mosquitoes, major vectors of Dengue, Zika,\nyellow fever, and Chikungunya viruses. The  R  enantiomer\nof any chiral FTE, synthesized enantioselectively, exhibited faster\nknockdown than its corresponding  S  enantiomer. PFTE\ndoes not prolong the opening of mosquito sodium channels that are\ncharacteristic of the action of DDT and pyrethroid insecticides. In\naddition, pyrethroid/DDT-resistant  Ae. aegypti  strains\nhaving enhanced P450-mediated detoxification and/or carrying sodium\nchannel mutations that confer knockdown resistance were not cross-resistant\nto PFTE. These results indicate a mechanism of PFTE insecticidal action\ndistinct from that of pyrethroids or DDT. Furthermore, PFTE elicited\nspatial repellency at concentrations as low as 10 ppm in a hand-in-cage\nassay. PFTE and MFTE were found to possess low mammalian toxicity.\nThese results suggest the substantial potential of FTEs as a new class\nof compounds for controlling insect vectors, including pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nmosquitoes. Further investigations of FTE insecticidal and repellency\nmechanisms could provide important insights into how incorporation\nof fluorine influences the rapid lethality and mosquito sensing.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFollowing trends in medicinal chemistry, 1  many new fluorine-containing insecticides 2  and other pesticides 3 − 5  have been introduced\nin recent decades, facilitated\nby developments in fluoro-organic chemistry and motivated by the need\nto mitigate metabolic resistance. Representative fluorine-containing\ninsecticides across diverse structural classes include metofluthrin,\nbifenthrin, fipronil, flupyradifuron, and bistrifluoron, as well as\nthe pro-insecticide chlorfenapyr. The introduction of fluorine atoms\nand trifluoromethyl groups can significantly improve insecticide bioavailability\nby enhancing lipophilicity, cellular membrane permeability, metabolic\nstability (e.g., against cytochrome P450 enzymatic oxidations), and\nbinding affinity with minimal steric perturbation. 3 , 6 − 8\n\nMalariologists 9 , 10  have emphasized\nthe continuing\nneed for new, inexpensive, for indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated\nbed nets. Neonicotinoids,\nwhich were approved by the WHO in 2018 as a new class of insecticides\nfor combatting pyrethroid resistance, quickly faltered as resistance\ndeveloped, presumably a result of their heavy use in agriculture. 11  There is an urgent need for new chemical agents\nthat can mitigate vector-borne diseases and overcome resistant organisms.\n\nPreviously, we reinvestigated a difluoro congener of DDT, DFDT\n(1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-(bis(4,4′- fluorophenyl)ethane), 12  and its chiral monofluoro analog, MFDT 13  (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-(4-chlorophenyl)-(4-fluorophenyl)ethane). 9  DFDT acted more rapidly than DDT against  Drosophila  and  Anopheles quadrimaculatus , a vector of malaria, as well as  Aedes aegypti ,\na vector of Zika, Yellow fever, Dengue, and Chikungunya viruses. Despite\nthe fact that DFDT’s neurophysiological efficacy  in\nvitro  is 10-fold smaller than that of DDT, as well as the\nobservation that DDT and DFDT are cross-resistant, amorphous DFDT\nis approximately 4 times faster than amorphous DDT in knocking down  Aedes  and  Anopheles  mosquitoes. 14  This difference may be attributed to the fluorine-enhanced\nlipophilicity 15  and thus bioavailability\nof DFDT molecules traversing cuticle and cellular membranes. 6\n\nMajor insecticides used for public health\nare crystalline, with\ncontact action like that of DDT. 15  The\nspeed of action (knockdown time) of contact insecticides depends on\nthe release of molecules from the solid surface of the insecticide,\nfollowed by the penetration of molecules into the insect cuticle. 16  We have demonstrated that the speed of action\nof organochlorine, 17 , 18  organofluorine, 9  pyrethroid, 19  and neonicotinoid 20  insecticides can be increased in metastable\nsolid-state forms of a given compound. Metastable solid forms of the\nsame chemical compound have higher free energies, thereby surrendering\ntoxicant molecules from their surfaces more readily to insect tarsi\nupon contact. The differential lethality of polymorphs demonstrates\nthat the rate of uptake from the solid surface is consequential. For\ninstance, a commercial formulation of deltamethrin dispersed on chalk\nthat had been heated briefly to 120 °C killed 100% of various\nresistant mosquito strains from Burkina Faso, without exception, whereas\nthe commercial material as obtained was ineffective. 21  This increased activity was attributed to the heat-induced\ntransformation of commercial deltamethrin crystals to another crystalline\nform with a higher bioavailability. 19  The\nmore active form persists for 13 months and counting. 21  Crystalline polymorphs with faster uptake can remove resistant\norganisms from a population where slower uptake polymorphs are indifferent.\nFor this reason we\nhave focused on inexpensive\ncompounds that work quickly, especially as the WHO is moving toward\nnew antimalarial compounds with previously unexplored mechanisms of\naction. 22\n\nHaving synthesized MFDT\nand evaluated its enantioselectivity in\ninsect knockdown, we tested the synthetic intermediate 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol.\nHerein, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of a group of related\nfluorine-containing 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol compounds, including\nper-fluorophenyl-trichloromethyl-ethanol (PFTE), with a particular\nfocus on their liquid, amorphous, and crystalline phases and the role\nof fluorine. We also examine the insecticidal and repellent actions\nof PFTE against  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes. Our findings\nindicate that fluorine-containing 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols\nare promising for combatting vector-borne human diseases.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nGiven\nthat DFDT only has fluorine on its  para  positions,\nthe introduction of additional aromatic fluorine atoms may further\nimprove its knockdown speed. On the other hand, prior studies have\ndemonstrated that the insecticidal potency of DDT decreased substantially\nwhen the trichloromethyl group was replaced with a trifluoromethyl\ngroup, 23  or when the α-hydrogen was\nsubstituted by fluorine. 24  Based on these\nresults, we synthesized fluorinated DFDT congeners  2a – 2e  with aromatic fluorine substituents ( Figures  1  and  2 A, and  Supporting Information ). 25 , 26  In addition, one synthetic intermediate, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol\n( 1b ;  Figures  1  and  2 A), was reported to have one-\nto two-fifths of DDT’s insecticidal activity against fruit\nflies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) in contact residual\nexposure bioassays. 27  This active intermediate\ninspired the synthesis of compounds  1a  (PFTE) and  1c  with respective perfluoro- and trifluoromethyl-phenyl groups\n( Figures  1  and  2 A, and  Supporting Information ).\n\nSynthetic routes of compounds with various chemical moieties.\n\n(A) Chemical structure of selected compounds.

Because\nthe knockdown speed of insecticides is highly dependent on their condensed\nphases, 9 , 30 − 33  we prepared all compounds at\nroom temperature to best reflect their efficacy in the field. Compounds  1a  and  1c  were always monomorphic from the evaporation\nof various solvents or from the melt ( Figure  4 A,  Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ).  1b ,  2a ,  2b , and  2e  were liquid at room\ntemperature. Although  2c  and  2d  could grow\ninto crystals at room temperature ( Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ), their amorphous\nstates, which were prepared by supercooling melts or fine mist spraying\nof solutions, persisted for at least 20 days at room temperature and\nwere used for lethality measurements. Each crystalline form was ground\ninto particles with sizes (50 μm) comparable to those of amorphous\nor liquid particles prepared by fine mist spraying. Female  Drosophila melanogaster , an accepted proxy for evaluating\ninsecticide potency against mosquitoes, 28  were placed in Petri dishes and exposed to 2.0 mg (10.6 μg/cm 2 ) of all compounds in  Figure  2 A in their amorphous, crystalline, or liquid forms.\nThe experimental procedure was similar to that previously reported\nby our laboratory. 9 , 32  The DDT crystalline polymorph\ndesignated Form I, 30  the DFDT crystalline\npolymorph also designated Form I, amorphous DFDT ( a -DFDT), 9  and deltamethrin (DM, a leading\npyrethroid 29 ) likewise Form I 32  were used for comparison ( a -DFDT and DM were known for their rapid knockdown properties). Knockdown\ntimes were analyzed by measuring the motion of flies recorded with\na video camera. The KT 50  values, here the median knockdown\ntimes for a fly population, were calculated by performing logistic\nregression analysis of knockdown–time curves ( Table S2 ). 30  The KT 50  values decreased in the order DDT-I (261 min) >  1c  (168\nmin) > DFDT-I (152 min) >  a -DFDT (54 min) >  1a  (36 min) > DM-I (30 min) ≈  1b  (29\nmin)\n( Figure  2 B,C). Liquid  1b  was comparable to DM Form I in lethality, although the\nuptake of molecules from liquid would be expected to be more rapid\nthan that from crystals. 31  Notably, crystalline  1a  and  1c  both exhibited rapid knockdown, and\nthe former was even faster in action than amorphous DFDT. In contrast,  2a – 2e , whether in their amorphous or liquid\nforms, were all less active than  a -DFDT ( Figure  2 C and  Figure S3 ). These results suggested that the\nfluorination of 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol is a viable strategy\nfor the discovery of rapid-acting agents.\n\nStructure–activity\nrelationships. (A–D) Compounds\nwith various chemical moieties. KT 50  (min) for  D. melanogaster  are denoted in parentheses. Physical states\nare denoted by color: crystals, orange; liquid, blue.

(E) Chemical structure of compounds with good knockdown properties.\n\n(A)  1a  crystallized into conglomerates with\na chiral  P 2 1  space group.

Other crystal\nstructures are available in the  Supporting Information . The apparently skewed unit cell is a consequence of a perspective\nview along a general direction. (C) Similar to  1a , enantiomers\nof  1b  prepared by the asymmetric synthesis shown in  Figure  2 .\n\nStructure–activity\nrelationship (SAR) studies were performed on  1a – 1c  to determine the key functionalities or moieties that may\ninfluence the insecticidal activity of 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol.\nCompounds  1d – 1z ,  4 – 6  with various chemical moieties were synthesized ( Figure  1  and  Supporting Information ), and their individual\nknockdown times against female  Drosophila  were evaluated\nat 10.6 μg/cm 2  ( Figure  3 ,  Figures S4 and S5 , and  Table S2 ). Female  Drosophila  in control groups typically began to become immobilized after 720\nmin; thus, compounds with KT 50  values >720 min were\nconsidered\ninactive.\n\nSAR studies revealed that aromatic substituents significantly\naffected lethality ( Figure  3 A). 1-Phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols that contain aromatic\nsubstituents of F ( 1a ,  1b ,  1d – 1i ), OCF 3  ( 1k ), CF 3  ( 1c ,  1j ,  1s ), and\na mixture of two fluorine functionalities ( 1q ,  1r ) exhibited rapid knockdown. In general, the ability of\naromatic substituents to improve knockdown decreased in the order\nF > OCF 3  > CF 3 . Aromatic fluorine substituents\nsubstantially influenced the physiochemical properties of compounds\nas well. Most compounds with  ortho  or  para  substituents were crystalline at room temperature, and their crystals\nwere each prepared in their thermodynamically stable forms for lethality\nmeasurements ( Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ). In contrast,  meta  substituents or the addition of the flexible OCF 3  substituent\ndecreased the melting points of some compounds to the extent that\nthey were liquids at room temperature. Compounds  1a  and  1b  were respectively the fastest-acting crystalline and liquid\ncompounds. Additionally, aromatic substituents with various steric\nand electronic effects were compared. Compounds that contain common\nelectron-donating ( 1m ,  1p ) or -withdrawing\n( 1n ,  1o ) groups were inactive. The switch\nfrom an OCF 3  ( 1k ) group to an SCF 3  ( 1l ) group, or from phenyl ( 1b ,  1c ) to other fluorinated aromatic systems ( 1t ,  1y ), led to a loss of activity. Moreover, the introduction\nof Cl ( 1z ), Br ( 1v ,  1x ), CH 3  ( 1u ), or OPh ( 1w ) substituent to\nfluoro- or trifluoromethylphenyl groups resulted in a significant\nlowering of activity.\n\nFollowing the SAR studies for aromatic\nsubstituents, we investigated\nthe effects of three moieties that were attached to the central carbon\natom. Acetoxylation led to a loss of activity, corroborating the importance\nof free alcohol in conferring lethality ( Figure  3 B). In contrast, the switch from H ( 1a ) to CH 3  ( 5 ) substituent had little\neffect on knockdown speed ( Figure  3 C). A −CH 3  substituent, however,\nprevented the crystallization of compound  5  at room temperature.\nThe impact of halogenated methyl groups was also probed by changing\nthe halogen ( Figure  3 D). CCl 3  ( 1c ) was superior to both CF 3  ( 7 ) and CBr 3  ( 6 ) substituents,\npresumably due to steric effects. In conclusion, the SAR studies showed\nthat 1-aryl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols and -propanols containing one\nor more aromatic substituents of F, OCF 3 , or CF 3  exhibited remarkable knockdown properties ( Figure  3 E).\n\nThe stereoisomers\nof a given insecticide may have different activities due to their\nunique interactions with the metabolic enzymes or the target site. 40  For example, our previous studies demonstrated\nthat the monofluoro congener of DDT—named MFDT—exhibited\nenantioselective lethality against  Drosophila . 9  Moreover, different insecticide stereoisomers\nmay have different environmental impacts. 32  Thus, single or enriched stereoisomer formulations of insecticides\nare preferable, because they can have both increased potency and reduced\nenvironmental impact. 33  We explored the\ndifference in the activity of enantiomers of  1a  and  1b , because their degrees of fluorination are on opposite\nends of the spectrum.\n\nInterestingly, racemic  1a  always crystallized as conglomerates 34  (a mixture of homochiral enantiomer crystals) in the  P 2 1  space group from solution or from melts ( Figure  4 A). In contrast, other racemates\ndisplayed in  Figure  3  all crystallized as racemates 47  (equimolar\namounts of enantiomers in the crystal lattices;  Figure  4 B and  Figure S2 ). Since the crystals in conglomerates of  1a  were tiny\nneedles (<100 μm), the separation of enantiomer crystals\nbased on crystal morphology (a Pasteur-like resolution) was not feasible.\nInstead, we prepared the enantiomers via asymmetric synthesis. Racemates\nwere oxidized to yield ketones, 35  which\nwere reduced by catecholborane in the presence of chiral oxazaborolidine\ncatalysts 36  to yield  1a  and  1b  enantiomers, each having 99% and 95% enantiomeric excess\n( Figure  1 , and  Supporting Information ). The absolute configuration\nof the  1a  enantiomers was assigned using single-crystal\nX-ray analysis ( Figure  4 A, and  Supporting Information ).\n\nFemale  Drosophila  were exposed to racemates and\nenantiomers of both crystalline  1a  and liquid  1b  at various dosages. The  R  forms of  1a  and  1b  were always faster-acting than their respective  S  forms ( Figure  5 A–E and  Table S2 ), suggesting\nenantioselectivity in insect uptake, metabolism, or neurotoxicity.\n( R )- 1a  was even faster-acting than DM\nForm I at very low dosages ( Figure  5 F and  Figure S6 ). In contrast,\nboth enantiomers of  1b  were less effective (KT 50  > 720 min) at 0.53 μg/cm 2 , requiring higher\nlethal\ndoses than of  1a . Therefore, the rapid knockdown speeds\nof  1b  and other figures shown for  Figure  3  are presumably dominated by the kinetics\nof uptake of molecules.\n\n(A–E) Knockdown of  1a  enantiomers\n(crystals)\nand  1b  enantiomers (liquid) against  D. melanogaster  at various\ndosages. At 0.53 μg/cm 2 , both  1b  enantiomers\nhad KT 50  values >720 min. The median knockdown time\nfor\neach curve is denoted by its intersection with the horizontal KT 50  marker. (F) KT 50  values versus dosage. Error\nbars represent 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\nTo determine whether PFTE induces rapid knockdown of mosquitoes,\nwe conducted a contact-based bioassay as described above for flies.\nAdult females of an insecticide-susceptible wild-type  Ae.\naegypti  strain, Rockefeller, were all knocked down in less\nthan 5 min upon contact exposure to PFTE at the concentration of 12.5\nμg/cm 2 . Furthermore, we observed 77% mortality after\nRockefeller mosquitoes were exposed to vapor emitted from PFTE of\n12.5 μg/cm 2  for 24 h ( Figure S1 ).\n\nGiven that PFTE induced very rapid knockdown at\n12.5 μg/cm 2 , we also conducted the contact bioassay\nusing 1.25 μg/cm 2  and recorded the percentage of\nknockdown over the course of 1 h ( Figure  6 ). Next, we examined two pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nstrains, KDR:ROCK 37  and Puerto Rico, 38  which carry different sodium channel mutations\nthat confer knockdown resistance (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroids. 37 , 39  The Puerto Rico strain also possesses an enhanced P450-mediated\nmetabolic detoxification mechanism of resistance. 38  As shown in  Figure  6 , the KT 50  values of PFTE against these pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nmosquitoes were not significantly different from those against the\nsusceptible mosquitoes, although KDR:ROCK mosquitoes were more sensitive\nto PFTE than Puerto Rico mosquitoes. These results show that, unlike\nin the case of DFDT, 28  there is no cross-resistance\nbetween PFTE, DDT, and pyrethroids. Further, our functional examination\nof mosquito sodium channels expressed in  Xenopus  oocytes\nindicates that, unlike pyrethroids and DDT, PFTE does not alter the\ngating of mosquito sodium channels ( Figure S2 ).\n\nKnockdown of  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes by crystalline\nPFTE. At the dosage of 1.25 μg/cm 2 , PFTE had KT 50  values of 15, 10, and 20 min for Rockefeller, KDR:ROCK and\nPuerto Rico mosquitoes, respectively. The median knockdown time for\neach curve is denoted by its intersection with the horizontal KT 50  dotted line. Curves with the same letter do not differ according\nto Log-Rank test, and dots denote the value of each biological replicate\n(mosquito). Rockefeller vs KDR:ROCK: Log Rank: χ 2  = 3.11,  df  = 1,  P  = 0.08; Rockefeller\nvs Puerto Rico: Log Rank: χ 2  = 3.22,  df  = 1,  P  = 0.073. KDR:ROCK vs Puerto Rico: χ 2  = 13.13,  df  = 1,  P  <\n0.001.\n\nThese results indicate that PFTE\nmay have unique target sites in\nthe nervous system. An observation that may be related is that the\nmiticide dicofol (2,2,2-trichloro-1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol),\nin which the α-carbon of DDT is hydroxylated, has a different\nmechanism of action than that of DDT itself. 40  It is indifferent to houseflies with DDT-related kdr, and it elicits\ndifferent symptoms of poisoning in susceptible flies, e.g., the absence\nof tremors. Subsequent research indicated that it may inhibit the\noctopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase enzyme. 41\n\nFuture studies using various nerve preparations are\nneeded to elucidate\nthe mechanism of PFTE action. Its perfluorination may not be subjected\nto detoxification by cytochrome P450 enzymes, but other metabolic\ndetoxification pathways, such as glucuronidation, are still possible.\nThe remarkably rapid knockdown by PFTE might be primarily attributed\nto the fact that fluorine significantly increases the lipophilicity,\nand thus bioavailability, of PFTE molecules, which are expected to\nrapidly traverse insect cuticle and cellular membranes.\n\nThe finding of PFTE vapor toxicity against  Ae. aegypti  prompted us to determine whether PFTE evokes spatial (noncontact)\nrepellency using a hand-in-cage assay, 42  as shown in  Figure  7 . PFTE was diluted in acetone and applied on a polyester netting\n(6.5 cm × 5.5 cm). After the acetone fully evaporated, the netting\nwas fixed in a modified glove worn by a tester. Groups of female Rockefeller\nmosquitoes were exposed to PFTE vapor for 5 min at concentrations\nranging from 10 to 10000 ppm. The repellency indexes at each concentration\nand control were determined by comparing the number of landings of\nmosquitoes in two trials: in a first trial with acetone-treated netting\nonly and a second trial with PFTE-treated netting (see details in\nref ( 42 )). When the\nmosquitoes were exposed to PFTE-treated netting, significantly fewer\nlandings were observed. The repellency by PFTE vapor was dose-dependent\nand observed at concentrations as low as 10 ppm of PFTE ( Figure  7 B). No mosquitoes\nwere knocked down or exhibited locomotive modifications during the\nnoncontact assay at all tested concentrations.\n\nPFTE elicits spatial\nrepellency in  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes.

This result indicates that, unlike transfluthrin repellency,\nthe kdr mutations did not affect repellency by PFTE, consistent with\nour toxicity results from contact assays ( Figure  6 ). Taken together, our findings indicate\nthat the mechanism of PFTE repellency is different from that of transfluthrin\nrepellency and appears to be independent of sodium channel activation.\n\nGiven that spatial repellency can be elicited by compounds that\nactivate odorant receptors in mosquitoes’ antennae, 42 , 44  we examined whether PFTE repellency is mediated by activation of\nodorant receptor (Or) using an  Ae. aegypti  mutant\nstrain in which the odorant receptor co-receptor gene ( orco ) was mutated. 45  Orco is required for\nOr-mediated olfactory activities, and the null mutation of  orco  resulted in impaired Or-mediated olfactory pathways. 45  We found that PFTE repellency was not reduced\nin orco –/–  mosquitoes compared with wild-type\n(Orlando) mosquitoes. PFTE at 1000 ppm evoked around 70% repellency\nin both mosquito strains ( Figure  7 D). Our findings suggest that spatial repellency by\nPFTE is not mediated by activation of odorant receptors.\n\nCompared\nwith other compounds that were recently tested against\nRockefeller mosquitoes in the hand-in-cage assay, the potency of PFTE\nin eliciting spatial repellency is comparable to those of plant-derived\ncompounds, but lower than those of DEET and volatile pyrethroids. 46 − 48  For instance, eucalyptol and camphor elicited 50–60% repellency\nat 100 ppm. Geranyl acetate elicited about 70–80% repellency\nat 100 ppm. 46 , 48  PFTE is only slightly more potent\nthan pyrethrin I and II which elicited 50–60% repellency at\n1000 ppm. 46  On the other hand, DEET, transfluthrin,\nand bioallethrin elicited ∼50% of mosquito repellency at 1–10\nppm. 47 , 49\n\nCompounds  1a  and  1b  were chosen for mammalian oral toxicity\nscreening because\ntheir structures and lethality were similar to, and representative\nof, other compounds identified in  Figure  3 A. Mammalian toxicity screening was conducted\nas per the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(OECD)’s guideline on the fixed dose procedure using female\nadult rats. 50  Compounds  1a  and  1b  both had oral median lethal dose (LD 50 ) values in the range of 300–2000 mg/kg and could be allocated\nto Category 4, according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS). 51  This is well above the recommended minimum lethal\ndosage for public health insecticides (>50 mg/kg; above the range\nof GHS Category 2). 52  The results indicated\nthat compounds  1a  and  1b  were  less\ntoxic to mammals  than conventional insecticides, including\norganochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids, and\nthey were comparable to neonicotinoids in mammalian\ntoxicity. 40\n\n## Fluorinated\nDFDT Congeners and 1-Phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols\n\nGiven\nthat DFDT only has fluorine on its  para  positions,\nthe introduction of additional aromatic fluorine atoms may further\nimprove its knockdown speed. On the other hand, prior studies have\ndemonstrated that the insecticidal potency of DDT decreased substantially\nwhen the trichloromethyl group was replaced with a trifluoromethyl\ngroup, 23  or when the α-hydrogen was\nsubstituted by fluorine. 24  Based on these\nresults, we synthesized fluorinated DFDT congeners  2a – 2e  with aromatic fluorine substituents ( Figures  1  and  2 A, and  Supporting Information ). 25 , 26  In addition, one synthetic intermediate, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol\n( 1b ;  Figures  1  and  2 A), was reported to have one-\nto two-fifths of DDT’s insecticidal activity against fruit\nflies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) in contact residual\nexposure bioassays. 27  This active intermediate\ninspired the synthesis of compounds  1a  (PFTE) and  1c  with respective perfluoro- and trifluoromethyl-phenyl groups\n( Figures  1  and  2 A, and  Supporting Information ).\n\nSynthetic routes of compounds with various chemical moieties.\n\n(A) Chemical structure of selected compounds.

Because\nthe knockdown speed of insecticides is highly dependent on their condensed\nphases, 9 , 30 − 33  we prepared all compounds at\nroom temperature to best reflect their efficacy in the field. Compounds  1a  and  1c  were always monomorphic from the evaporation\nof various solvents or from the melt ( Figure  4 A,  Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ).  1b ,  2a ,  2b , and  2e  were liquid at room\ntemperature. Although  2c  and  2d  could grow\ninto crystals at room temperature ( Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ), their amorphous\nstates, which were prepared by supercooling melts or fine mist spraying\nof solutions, persisted for at least 20 days at room temperature and\nwere used for lethality measurements. Each crystalline form was ground\ninto particles with sizes (50 μm) comparable to those of amorphous\nor liquid particles prepared by fine mist spraying. Female  Drosophila melanogaster , an accepted proxy for evaluating\ninsecticide potency against mosquitoes, 28  were placed in Petri dishes and exposed to 2.0 mg (10.6 μg/cm 2 ) of all compounds in  Figure  2 A in their amorphous, crystalline, or liquid forms.\nThe experimental procedure was similar to that previously reported\nby our laboratory. 9 , 32  The DDT crystalline polymorph\ndesignated Form I, 30  the DFDT crystalline\npolymorph also designated Form I, amorphous DFDT ( a -DFDT), 9  and deltamethrin (DM, a leading\npyrethroid 29 ) likewise Form I 32  were used for comparison ( a -DFDT and DM were known for their rapid knockdown properties). Knockdown\ntimes were analyzed by measuring the motion of flies recorded with\na video camera. The KT 50  values, here the median knockdown\ntimes for a fly population, were calculated by performing logistic\nregression analysis of knockdown–time curves ( Table S2 ). 30  The KT 50  values decreased in the order DDT-I (261 min) >  1c  (168\nmin) > DFDT-I (152 min) >  a -DFDT (54 min) >  1a  (36 min) > DM-I (30 min) ≈  1b  (29\nmin)\n( Figure  2 B,C). Liquid  1b  was comparable to DM Form I in lethality, although the\nuptake of molecules from liquid would be expected to be more rapid\nthan that from crystals. 31  Notably, crystalline  1a  and  1c  both exhibited rapid knockdown, and\nthe former was even faster in action than amorphous DFDT. In contrast,  2a – 2e , whether in their amorphous or liquid\nforms, were all less active than  a -DFDT ( Figure  2 C and  Figure S3 ). These results suggested that the\nfluorination of 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol is a viable strategy\nfor the discovery of rapid-acting agents.\n\nStructure–activity\nrelationships.

(C) Similar to  1a , enantiomers\nof  1b  prepared by the asymmetric synthesis shown in  Figure  2 .\n\n## Structure–Activity Relationships\n\nStructure–activity\nrelationship (SAR) studies were performed on  1a – 1c  to determine the key functionalities or moieties that may\ninfluence the insecticidal activity of 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol.\nCompounds  1d – 1z ,  4 – 6  with various chemical moieties were synthesized ( Figure  1  and  Supporting Information ), and their individual\nknockdown times against female  Drosophila  were evaluated\nat 10.6 μg/cm 2  ( Figure  3 ,  Figures S4 and S5 , and  Table S2 ). Female  Drosophila  in control groups typically began to become immobilized after 720\nmin; thus, compounds with KT 50  values >720 min were\nconsidered\ninactive.\n\nSAR studies revealed that aromatic substituents significantly\naffected lethality ( Figure  3 A). 1-Phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols that contain aromatic\nsubstituents of F ( 1a ,  1b ,  1d – 1i ), OCF 3  ( 1k ), CF 3  ( 1c ,  1j ,  1s ), and\na mixture of two fluorine functionalities ( 1q ,  1r ) exhibited rapid knockdown. In general, the ability of\naromatic substituents to improve knockdown decreased in the order\nF > OCF 3  > CF 3 . Aromatic fluorine substituents\nsubstantially influenced the physiochemical properties of compounds\nas well. Most compounds with  ortho  or  para  substituents were crystalline at room temperature, and their crystals\nwere each prepared in their thermodynamically stable forms for lethality\nmeasurements ( Figures S1 and S2 , and  Table S1 ). In contrast,  meta  substituents or the addition of the flexible OCF 3  substituent\ndecreased the melting points of some compounds to the extent that\nthey were liquids at room temperature. Compounds  1a  and  1b  were respectively the fastest-acting crystalline and liquid\ncompounds. Additionally, aromatic substituents with various steric\nand electronic effects were compared. Compounds that contain common\nelectron-donating ( 1m ,  1p ) or -withdrawing\n( 1n ,  1o ) groups were inactive. The switch\nfrom an OCF 3  ( 1k ) group to an SCF 3  ( 1l ) group, or from phenyl ( 1b ,  1c ) to other fluorinated aromatic systems ( 1t ,  1y ), led to a loss of activity. Moreover, the introduction\nof Cl ( 1z ), Br ( 1v ,  1x ), CH 3  ( 1u ), or OPh ( 1w ) substituent to\nfluoro- or trifluoromethylphenyl groups resulted in a significant\nlowering of activity.\n\nFollowing the SAR studies for aromatic\nsubstituents, we investigated\nthe effects of three moieties that were attached to the central carbon\natom. Acetoxylation led to a loss of activity, corroborating the importance\nof free alcohol in conferring lethality ( Figure  3 B). In contrast, the switch from H ( 1a ) to CH 3  ( 5 ) substituent had little\neffect on knockdown speed ( Figure  3 C). A −CH 3  substituent, however,\nprevented the crystallization of compound  5  at room temperature.\nThe impact of halogenated methyl groups was also probed by changing\nthe halogen ( Figure  3 D). CCl 3  ( 1c ) was superior to both CF 3  ( 7 ) and CBr 3  ( 6 ) substituents,\npresumably due to steric effects. In conclusion, the SAR studies showed\nthat 1-aryl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanols and -propanols containing one\nor more aromatic substituents of F, OCF 3 , or CF 3  exhibited remarkable knockdown properties ( Figure  3 E).\n\n## Enantioselective Toxicities against Flies\n\nThe stereoisomers\nof a given insecticide may have different activities due to their\nunique interactions with the metabolic enzymes or the target site. 40  For example, our previous studies demonstrated\nthat the monofluoro congener of DDT—named MFDT—exhibited\nenantioselective lethality against  Drosophila . 9  Moreover, different insecticide stereoisomers\nmay have different environmental impacts. 32  Thus, single or enriched stereoisomer formulations of insecticides\nare preferable, because they can have both increased potency and reduced\nenvironmental impact. 33  We explored the\ndifference in the activity of enantiomers of  1a  and  1b , because their degrees of fluorination are on opposite\nends of the spectrum.\n\nInterestingly, racemic  1a  always crystallized as conglomerates 34  (a mixture of homochiral enantiomer crystals) in the  P 2 1  space group from solution or from melts ( Figure  4 A). In contrast, other racemates\ndisplayed in  Figure  3  all crystallized as racemates 47  (equimolar\namounts of enantiomers in the crystal lattices;  Figure  4 B and  Figure S2 ). Since the crystals in conglomerates of  1a  were tiny\nneedles (<100 μm), the separation of enantiomer crystals\nbased on crystal morphology (a Pasteur-like resolution) was not feasible.\nInstead, we prepared the enantiomers via asymmetric synthesis. Racemates\nwere oxidized to yield ketones, 35  which\nwere reduced by catecholborane in the presence of chiral oxazaborolidine\ncatalysts 36  to yield  1a  and  1b  enantiomers, each having 99% and 95% enantiomeric excess\n( Figure  1 , and  Supporting Information ). The absolute configuration\nof the  1a  enantiomers was assigned using single-crystal\nX-ray analysis ( Figure  4 A, and  Supporting Information ).\n\nFemale  Drosophila  were exposed to racemates and\nenantiomers of both crystalline  1a  and liquid  1b  at various dosages. The  R  forms of  1a  and  1b  were always faster-acting than their respective  S  forms ( Figure  5 A–E and  Table S2 ), suggesting\nenantioselectivity in insect uptake, metabolism, or neurotoxicity.\n( R )- 1a  was even faster-acting than DM\nForm I at very low dosages ( Figure  5 F and  Figure S6 ). In contrast,\nboth enantiomers of  1b  were less effective (KT 50  > 720 min) at 0.53 μg/cm 2 , requiring higher\nlethal\ndoses than of  1a . Therefore, the rapid knockdown speeds\nof  1b  and other figures shown for  Figure  3  are presumably dominated by the kinetics\nof uptake of molecules.\n\n(A–E) Knockdown of  1a  enantiomers\n(crystals)\nand  1b  enantiomers (liquid) against  D. melanogaster  at various\ndosages. At 0.53 μg/cm 2 , both  1b  enantiomers\nhad KT 50  values >720 min. The median knockdown time\nfor\neach curve is denoted by its intersection with the horizontal KT 50  marker. (F) KT 50  values versus dosage. Error\nbars represent 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\n## Toxicity of PFTE against  Aedes aegypti  Mosquitoes\n\nTo determine whether PFTE induces rapid knockdown of mosquitoes,\nwe conducted a contact-based bioassay as described above for flies.\nAdult females of an insecticide-susceptible wild-type  Ae.\naegypti  strain, Rockefeller, were all knocked down in less\nthan 5 min upon contact exposure to PFTE at the concentration of 12.5\nμg/cm 2 . Furthermore, we observed 77% mortality after\nRockefeller mosquitoes were exposed to vapor emitted from PFTE of\n12.5 μg/cm 2  for 24 h ( Figure S1 ).\n\nGiven that PFTE induced very rapid knockdown at\n12.5 μg/cm 2 , we also conducted the contact bioassay\nusing 1.25 μg/cm 2  and recorded the percentage of\nknockdown over the course of 1 h ( Figure  6 ). Next, we examined two pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nstrains, KDR:ROCK 37  and Puerto Rico, 38  which carry different sodium channel mutations\nthat confer knockdown resistance (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroids. 37 , 39  The Puerto Rico strain also possesses an enhanced P450-mediated\nmetabolic detoxification mechanism of resistance. 38  As shown in  Figure  6 , the KT 50  values of PFTE against these pyrethroid/DDT-resistant\nmosquitoes were not significantly different from those against the\nsusceptible mosquitoes, although KDR:ROCK mosquitoes were more sensitive\nto PFTE than Puerto Rico mosquitoes. These results show that, unlike\nin the case of DFDT, 28  there is no cross-resistance\nbetween PFTE, DDT, and pyrethroids. Further, our functional examination\nof mosquito sodium channels expressed in  Xenopus  oocytes\nindicates that, unlike pyrethroids and DDT, PFTE does not alter the\ngating of mosquito sodium channels ( Figure S2 ).\n\nKnockdown of  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes by crystalline\nPFTE. At the dosage of 1.25 μg/cm 2 , PFTE had KT 50  values of 15, 10, and 20 min for Rockefeller, KDR:ROCK and\nPuerto Rico mosquitoes, respectively. The median knockdown time for\neach curve is denoted by its intersection with the horizontal KT 50  dotted line. Curves with the same letter do not differ according\nto Log-Rank test, and dots denote the value of each biological replicate\n(mosquito). Rockefeller vs KDR:ROCK: Log Rank: χ 2  = 3.11,  df  = 1,  P  = 0.08; Rockefeller\nvs Puerto Rico: Log Rank: χ 2  = 3.22,  df  = 1,  P  = 0.073. KDR:ROCK vs Puerto Rico: χ 2  = 13.13,  df  = 1,  P  <\n0.001.\n\nThese results indicate that PFTE\nmay have unique target sites in\nthe nervous system. An observation that may be related is that the\nmiticide dicofol (2,2,2-trichloro-1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol),\nin which the α-carbon of DDT is hydroxylated, has a different\nmechanism of action than that of DDT itself. 40  It is indifferent to houseflies with DDT-related kdr, and it elicits\ndifferent symptoms of poisoning in susceptible flies, e.g., the absence\nof tremors. Subsequent research indicated that it may inhibit the\noctopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase enzyme. 41\n\nFuture studies using various nerve preparations are\nneeded to elucidate\nthe mechanism of PFTE action. Its perfluorination may not be subjected\nto detoxification by cytochrome P450 enzymes, but other metabolic\ndetoxification pathways, such as glucuronidation, are still possible.\nThe remarkably rapid knockdown by PFTE might be primarily attributed\nto the fact that fluorine significantly increases the lipophilicity,\nand thus bioavailability, of PFTE molecules, which are expected to\nrapidly traverse insect cuticle and cellular membranes.\n\n## Repellency\nof PFTE against  Aedes aegypti  Mosquitoes\n\nThe finding of PFTE vapor toxicity against  Ae. aegypti  prompted us to determine whether PFTE evokes spatial (noncontact)\nrepellency using a hand-in-cage assay, 42  as shown in  Figure  7 . PFTE was diluted in acetone and applied on a polyester netting\n(6.5 cm × 5.5 cm). After the acetone fully evaporated, the netting\nwas fixed in a modified glove worn by a tester. Groups of female Rockefeller\nmosquitoes were exposed to PFTE vapor for 5 min at concentrations\nranging from 10 to 10000 ppm. The repellency indexes at each concentration\nand control were determined by comparing the number of landings of\nmosquitoes in two trials: in a first trial with acetone-treated netting\nonly and a second trial with PFTE-treated netting (see details in\nref ( 42 )). When the\nmosquitoes were exposed to PFTE-treated netting, significantly fewer\nlandings were observed. The repellency by PFTE vapor was dose-dependent\nand observed at concentrations as low as 10 ppm of PFTE ( Figure  7 B). No mosquitoes\nwere knocked down or exhibited locomotive modifications during the\nnoncontact assay at all tested concentrations.\n\nPFTE elicits spatial\nrepellency in  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes. (A) Schematic\ndrawing illustrating the hand-in-cage\nsetup used to evaluate spatial repellency. (B) Dose-dependent PFTE\nrepellency in Rockefeller (wild-type) mosquitoes. Student’s  t -test, 10 ppm:  t  = −3.85,  df  = 13,  P  = 0.802; 100 ppm:  t  = −7.50,  df  = 18,  P  <\n0.001; 1000 ppm:  t  = −10.49,  df  = 18,  P  < 0.001; 10000 ppm:  t  = −14.35,  df  = 13,  P  <\n0.001.  n  values for control (0) = 10 cages, 10 ppm\n= 5 cages, 100 and 1000 ppm = 10 cages each, 10 000 ppm = 5\ncages. (C) PFTE repellency in Rockefeller and KDR:ROCK mosquitoes.\nStudent’s  t -test, control:  t  = −0.41,  df  = 14,  P  = 0.685;\n100 ppm:  t  = −0.34,  df  =\n8,  P  = 0.738; 1000 ppm:  t  = −1.69,  df  = 18,  P  = 0.107.  n  values\nfor control (0) for both Rockefeller and KDR:ROCK = 8 cages, 100 ppm\nfor both strain = 5 cages each, 1000 ppm for both strains = 10 cages\neach. (D) PFTE repellency in Orlando (wild-type) and orco –/–  mosquitoes. Student’s  t -test, control:  t  = −0.02,  df  = 14,  P  = 0.982; 1000 ppm:  t  = 1.13,  df  = 18,  P  = 0.273.  n  values for\ncontrol (0) for both Orlando and orco –/–  =\n8 cages, 1000 ppm for both Orlando and orco –/–  = 10 cages. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Dots over the\nbars represent individual replicate values. ns = not significant,\n** P  < 0.01, *** P  < 0.001.\n\nWe showed in a recent study that activation of\nvoltage-gated sodium\nchannels alone by transfluthrin, a volatile pyrethroid, was sufficient\nto elicit spatial repellency in  Ae. aegypti  and that\nkdr mutations in sodium channels reduced transfluthrin repellency. 43  Here, we found that KDR:ROCK mosquitoes exhibited\nsimilar levels of repellency compared to wild-type Rockefeller mosquitoes\nwhen exposed to PFTE ( Figure  7 D). This result indicates that, unlike transfluthrin repellency,\nthe kdr mutations did not affect repellency by PFTE, consistent with\nour toxicity results from contact assays ( Figure  6 ). Taken together, our findings indicate\nthat the mechanism of PFTE repellency is different from that of transfluthrin\nrepellency and appears to be independent of sodium channel activation.\n\nGiven that spatial repellency can be elicited by compounds that\nactivate odorant receptors in mosquitoes’ antennae, 42 , 44  we examined whether PFTE repellency is mediated by activation of\nodorant receptor (Or) using an  Ae. aegypti  mutant\nstrain in which the odorant receptor co-receptor gene ( orco ) was mutated. 45  Orco is required for\nOr-mediated olfactory activities, and the null mutation of  orco  resulted in impaired Or-mediated olfactory pathways. 45  We found that PFTE repellency was not reduced\nin orco –/–  mosquitoes compared with wild-type\n(Orlando) mosquitoes. PFTE at 1000 ppm evoked around 70% repellency\nin both mosquito strains ( Figure  7 D). Our findings suggest that spatial repellency by\nPFTE is not mediated by activation of odorant receptors.\n\nCompared\nwith other compounds that were recently tested against\nRockefeller mosquitoes in the hand-in-cage assay, the potency of PFTE\nin eliciting spatial repellency is comparable to those of plant-derived\ncompounds, but lower than those of DEET and volatile pyrethroids. 46 − 48  For instance, eucalyptol and camphor elicited 50–60% repellency\nat 100 ppm. Geranyl acetate elicited about 70–80% repellency\nat 100 ppm. 46 , 48  PFTE is only slightly more potent\nthan pyrethrin I and II which elicited 50–60% repellency at\n1000 ppm. 46  On the other hand, DEET, transfluthrin,\nand bioallethrin elicited ∼50% of mosquito repellency at 1–10\nppm. 47 , 49\n\n## Rat Oral Toxicity\n\nCompounds  1a  and  1b  were chosen for mammalian oral toxicity\nscreening because\ntheir structures and lethality were similar to, and representative\nof, other compounds identified in  Figure  3 A. Mammalian toxicity screening was conducted\nas per the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(OECD)’s guideline on the fixed dose procedure using female\nadult rats. 50  Compounds  1a  and  1b  both had oral median lethal dose (LD 50 ) values in the range of 300–2000 mg/kg and could be allocated\nto Category 4, according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS). 51  This is well above the recommended minimum lethal\ndosage for public health insecticides (>50 mg/kg; above the range\nof GHS Category 2). 52  The results indicated\nthat compounds  1a  and  1b  were  less\ntoxic to mammals  than conventional insecticides, including\norganochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids, and\nthey were comparable to neonicotinoids in mammalian\ntoxicity. 40\n\n## Conclusions\n\nFluorine-containing\n1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloro-ethanol (FTEs) exhibit\nrapid knockdown properties, low mammalian toxicity, and no cross-resistance\nwith DDT or pyrethroids. One enantiomer of any chiral FTE showed faster\nknockdown speed than its counterpart at various dosages, demonstrating\nchiral discrimination during the uptake of the molecule or when binding\nat target site. Furthermore, PFTE possesses both vapor toxicity and\nspatial repellent actions against  Ae. aegypti  mosquitoes.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of FTEs for vector control,\nand they provide important insights regarding the unique role of fluorine\nin the design of active insecticidal and repellent compounds. Nevertheless,\nmore toxicological, electrophysiological, ecological, and epidemiological\nstudies must be performed to better understand the molecular mechanism\nof FTEs as insecticides and repellents and to fully anticipate unintended\nconsequences, such as insecticide resistance.\n\n## Methods\n\nAll chemical reagents and solvents\nwere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fischer Chemical and used as\nsupplied. 5 mL glass fine mist spray bottles, purchased from Infinity\nJars, Inc., were used for spraying insecticide solutions. Fruit flies\n( Drosophila melanogaster ) were raised in-house using\nstandard protocols. We used five  Ae. aegypti  mosquito\nstrains in this study: Rockefeller, KDR:ROCK, Puerto Rico, Orlando,\nand orco –/– . Rockefeller is an insecticide-susceptible\nwild-type strain. The KDR:ROCK strain was generated by crossing the\npyrethroid-resistant strain Singapore 53  with the Rockefeller strain, followed by four backcrosses to Rockefeller,\nand selected for the S989P+V1016G haplotype. 37  The mechanism of resistance in the KDR:ROCK strain is solely due\nto the two kdr mutations (S989P and V1016G). 37  Both Rockefeller and KDR:ROCK were kindly provided by J. G. Scott\n(Cornell University). Puerto Rico is a second pyrethroid-resistant\nstrain (from BEI Resources at the National Institute of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH), which carries three kdr mutations,\nV410L, V1016G, and F1534C, and has an enhanced P450-mediated pyrethroid\ndetoxification mechanism of resistance. 38  Orlando (kindly provided by L. Vosshall, Rockefeller University)\nis another insecticide-susceptible wild-type strain, from which an\nOrco mutant, orco –/–  (orco 16  from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH), was generated. 45  In orco –/– , the  orco  gene was mutated resulting in impaired Or-mediated\nolfactory responses. Mosquitoes were maintained in an environmental\ngrowth chamber at Duke Phytotron in the Department of Biology, Duke\nUniversity, at 27 °C, with 50–60% relative humidity and\na 12:12 h light/dark photoperiod. Larvae were fed with beef liver\npowder (NOW Foods), and adults were fed with 10% aqueous sucrose.\nAdult females were blood-fed 5 days after emergence using defibrinated\nsheep blood (Colorado Serum Company).\n\nDetails\nof the chemical syntheses,  1 H,  13 C, and  19 F NMR spectra, and chiral HPLC\nelution data of compounds  1a – 1z ,\n( R )- 1a , ( S )- 1a , ( R )- 1b , ( S )- 1b ,  2a – 2e ,  3a ,  3b , and  4 – 6  can be\nfound in the  Supporting Information .  1 H,  13 C, and  19 F NMR spectra were recorded\non a Bruker AVIII 400 MHz spectrometer at 400, 100, and 377 MHz, respectively.\nChemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to\nthe residual deuterated chloroform peak (7.26 ppm for  1 H NMR and 77.23 for proton-decoupled  13 C NMR).  19 F NMR chemical shifts are reported relative to the external standard\nα,α,α-trifluorotoluene, δ −63.72. Data\nare represented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity ( s  = singlet,  d  = doublet,  t  = triplet,  q  = quartet,  m  = multiplet),\ncoupling constants ( J ) in Hertz (Hz), integration.\nHPLC traces were obtained using an Agilent 1260 Infinity instrument\nwith CHIRALPAK OJ-H or OD-H columns.\n\nSingle crystals\nof ( R )- 1a , ( S )- 1a ,  1c ,  1e ,  1f ,  1h ,  1i ,  2c , and  2d  for\nX-ray analysis were prepared in 20 mL glass vials by slow evaporation\nfrom saturated acetone, ethanol, or dichloromethane solutions at room\ntemperature. The X-ray intensity data were recorded on a Bruker D8\nAPEX-II CCD system using graphite-monochromated and 0.5 mm MonoCap-collimated\nMo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) with the ω\nscan method at 100 K. The selected crystallographic parameters are\nlisted in  Table S1 . Crystallographic information\nfiles (CIFs), including the HKL and RES data, are deposited in the\nCCDC with numbers 2102296 (( R )- 1a ),\n2102297 (( S )- 1a ), 2102298 ( 1c ), 2102299 ( 1e ), 2102300 ( 1f ), 2102301\n( 1h ), 2102302 ( 1i ), 2102303 ( 2c ), and 2102304 ( 2d ).\n\nThe lethality of solid-state forms\nof insecticide was determined by the residual exposure method. Each\ncrystalline form was ground to a particle size similar to the size\nof the amorphous or liquid droplets prepared by fine mist spraying.\nFor  D. melanogaster  flies, lethality measurements\nwere performed in duplicate for each compound, each accompanied by\ntwo controls (no insecticide). Each microcrystalline form was added\nto a 10 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish, which was subsequently\nshaken to disperse the microcrystals throughout the Petri dish. Amorphous\nor liquid forms were prepared by fine mist spraying a hexane stock\nsolution, with various concentrations in 10 mL hexane, onto the top\nand bottom of 10 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dishes (two sprays\n= 0.280 mL) and allowing the hexane to evaporate at room temperature.\nFlies were sedated with carbon dioxide (for 30 s), and 25 females\nwere transferred to each Petri dish. The top of the dish was then\nplaced over the bottom, and the motion of the flies was recorded with\na video camera (Sony HDR-CX455). The knockdown time was measured for\neach individual fly, with knockdown associated with an insect laying\non the bottom surface of the Petri dish in a supine position without\nmoving from its original position after 10 s.\n\nFor  Ae.\naegypti  mosquitoes, lethality measurements were performed\nin similar conditions as described for flies.  1a  microcrystalline\nform (ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg) was added to a 9 cm diameter polystyrene\nPetri dish, which was subsequently shaken to disperse the microcrystals\nthroughout the Petri dish, providing concentrations that ranged from\n1.25 to 12.5 μg/cm 2 . Twenty (4–9 days old)\nfemale mosquitoes were sedated with carbon dioxide (for 20 s) and\ntransferred to the 9 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish which was\nthen covered with a lid to prevent their escape. Three Petri dishes\ncontaining 20 female mosquitoes each (replicates) were used, totaling\n60 mosquitoes for each strain. The number of mosquitoes that were\nknocked down (i.e., an insect laying on the bottom surface of the\nPetri dish in a supine position without moving from its original position\nafter 10 s) was recorded every 5 min (for 40 min). For the vapor toxicity\nassay we used 1.0 mg of  1a  microcrystalline form, which\nwas subsequently shaken to disperse the microcrystals throughout the\nPetri dish, providing concentrations of 12.5 μg/cm 2 . On top of the treated Petri dish a second modified Petri dish was\nplaced. For that, a 9 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish with a 7\ncm diameter hole was used to create a window, and a polyester netting\n(Shason Textile Inc., part number WSB532-111, white; 8.0 cm of diameter)\nwas fixed in the bottom of the modified Petri dish to prevent mosquitoes\nfrom making direct contact with the compound. This setup allowed the\nmosquitoes to be exposed to the vapor phase of compound  1a  only ( Figure  7 B).\nTwenty (4–9 days old) female mosquitoes were sedated with carbon\ndioxide (for 20 s) and transferred to the modified Petri dish which\nwas then covered with a lid to prevent their escape. Five replicates\n(i.e., modified Petri dishes containing 20 female mosquitoes each)\nwere used. The mortality was evaluated after 24 h of exposure.\n\nWe evaluated whether compound  1a  possesses\npyrethroid and DDT-like activities on the mosquito\nwild-type sodium channel (AaNa v 1-1). AaNa v 1-1\nchannels were expressed in  Xenopus  oocytes and functionally\ncharacterized using a two-electrode voltage clamp as previously described. 54 , 55  Briefly, the tail-current induced by compound  1a  and\ndeltamethrin (positive control) following a 100-pulse train of 5 ms\ndepolarization from −120 mV to 0 mV with 10 ms was measured. 56  We also tested the inhibitory effect of  1a  on channel inactivation in the DDT protocol 57  by measuring the remaining current at the end\nof a 500 ms depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential\nof −120 mV. For this protocol cells were previously incubated\nfor 3–4 h in 100 μM PFTE. Six oocytes (i.e., six replicates)\nexpressing AaNa v 1-1 were tested for both control (i.e.,\nDMSO) and compound  1a .\n\nWe assessed the spatial (i.e., noncontact)\nrepellency elicited by compound  1a  using a hand-in-cage\nassay. 42  Briefly, a human hand wearing\na modified nitrile glove (Ansell Protective Products, part number\n37-155) was placed inside a 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm mosquito\ncage (BioQuip) with a digital camera (e-con Systems Inc., model e-CAM51A)\nmounted on its top. The camera was connected to a laptop computer\nto record mosquito landings. 42  The nitrile\nrubber glove\nworn by a tester\nwas cut on its back to create a window (6 cm × 5 cm). A rectangular\n(6.5 cm × 5.5 cm) magnetic frame was glued onto the cut window,\nwhich served as a base for\nstacking additional magnetic window frames. One piece of test-compound-treated\npolyester netting (Shason Textile Inc., part number WS-B532-111, Walmart\nno. 567948282, white; slightly larger than the dimension of the window,\nbut smaller than the outer edge dimensions of the magnetic frames)\nwas placed on this fixed magnetic frame, which was ∼3.0 mm\nabove the glove and hand. To the compound-treated netting was applied\n500 μL of either solvent (acetone) or test compound (PFTE) in\na glass Petri dish, in an adjacent room. After acetone was fully evaporated\n(approximately 7 min), the netting was assembled into the window created\nin the glove. The hand makes no contact with the treated netting.\nThe second piece of the netting was untreated and was placed ∼8.0\nmm above the treated netting using a stack of four magnetic frames.\nThe stacked magnetic frames were further secured with two binder clips.\nThe stacking creates sufficient space between the treated netting\nand the untreated netting so that mosquitoes that land on the open\nwindow were not able to contact the treated netting or contact and\npierce the skin of the hand in the glove. Eighteen hours before the\nassay, 4- to 9-day-old female mosquitoes\n(about 40, mated, non-blood-fed) were transferred into each cage.\nGroups of 40 female mosquitoes were exposed for 4 min to PFTE at different\ndilutions ranging from 10 to 10 000 ppm, which correspond to\n0.14, 1.4, 14.0, and 140 μg/cm 2 . The cages were kept\nunder controlled conditions inside an environmental growth chamber\n(27 °C, relative humidity of ∼55%, and 12 h photoperiod).\nA cotton ball soaked with distilled water was placed on the top of\neach cage. Any cage that gave a low landing number (i.e., <50%\nof the average landing compared with other cages) in the first run\nwas not continued with the second run. Repellency index was calculated\nusing the following equation: Percentage repellency = [1 –\n(cumulative number of landings on the window of treatment/cumulative\nnumber of landings on the window of solvent treatment)] × 100).\nFor each concentration or mosquito strain we used at least five cages\n(i.e., 5 replicates).\n\nThe rat oral\ntoxicity test was\nconducted at Envigo CRS GmbH, Germany, according to the OECD guideline\nfor the fixed dose procedure, 42  using female\nadults of the Wistar Ham strain. The test compounds were formulated\nat concentrations of 30 and 200 mg/mL in corn oil and administered\nat a constant dose volume of 10 mL/kg body weight. Clinical observations\nand inspections for morbidity/mortality were performed at least three\ntimes within the first 6 h after application, thereafter at least\nonce daily for 14 days. If a rat displayed a high state of pain or\ndistress, it was considered to be not surviving the treatment and\nwas sacrificed immediately.\n\nLogistic regression\nof knockdown–time\ncurves was preformed to obtain the median knockdown time (KT 50 ) of the test flies and mosquitoes, the 95% confidence intervals\n(CI), slopes, and standard errors (SE) using Qcal software. 41  To evaluate the mosquito knockdown time we used\nthe survival analysis and estimated the median lethal time (i.e.,\nKT 50 ) applying Kaplan–Meier estimators (Log-rank\nmethod) available in SigmaPlot 12.0 (Systat 218 Software, San Jose,\nCalifornia, USA). For the repellency data unpaired Student’s  t  tests were used to compare two sets of data. All statistical\nanalyses and figure plotting were done using SigmaPlot v.12.5 (Systat\nSoftware).\n\n## Chemicals and\nInsects\n\nAll chemical reagents and solvents\nwere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fischer Chemical and used as\nsupplied. 5 mL glass fine mist spray bottles, purchased from Infinity\nJars, Inc., were used for spraying insecticide solutions. Fruit flies\n( Drosophila melanogaster ) were raised in-house using\nstandard protocols. We used five  Ae. aegypti  mosquito\nstrains in this study: Rockefeller, KDR:ROCK, Puerto Rico, Orlando,\nand orco –/– . Rockefeller is an insecticide-susceptible\nwild-type strain. The KDR:ROCK strain was generated by crossing the\npyrethroid-resistant strain Singapore 53  with the Rockefeller strain, followed by four backcrosses to Rockefeller,\nand selected for the S989P+V1016G haplotype. 37  The mechanism of resistance in the KDR:ROCK strain is solely due\nto the two kdr mutations (S989P and V1016G). 37  Both Rockefeller and KDR:ROCK were kindly provided by J. G. Scott\n(Cornell University). Puerto Rico is a second pyrethroid-resistant\nstrain (from BEI Resources at the National Institute of Allergy and\nInfectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH), which carries three kdr mutations,\nV410L, V1016G, and F1534C, and has an enhanced P450-mediated pyrethroid\ndetoxification mechanism of resistance. 38  Orlando (kindly provided by L. Vosshall, Rockefeller University)\nis another insecticide-susceptible wild-type strain, from which an\nOrco mutant, orco –/–  (orco 16  from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH), was generated. 45  In orco –/– , the  orco  gene was mutated resulting in impaired Or-mediated\nolfactory responses. Mosquitoes were maintained in an environmental\ngrowth chamber at Duke Phytotron in the Department of Biology, Duke\nUniversity, at 27 °C, with 50–60% relative humidity and\na 12:12 h light/dark photoperiod. Larvae were fed with beef liver\npowder (NOW Foods), and adults were fed with 10% aqueous sucrose.\nAdult females were blood-fed 5 days after emergence using defibrinated\nsheep blood (Colorado Serum Company).\n\n## Synthesis\n\nDetails\nof the chemical syntheses,  1 H,  13 C, and  19 F NMR spectra, and chiral HPLC\nelution data of compounds  1a – 1z ,\n( R )- 1a , ( S )- 1a , ( R )- 1b , ( S )- 1b ,  2a – 2e ,  3a ,  3b , and  4 – 6  can be\nfound in the  Supporting Information .  1 H,  13 C, and  19 F NMR spectra were recorded\non a Bruker AVIII 400 MHz spectrometer at 400, 100, and 377 MHz, respectively.\nChemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to\nthe residual deuterated chloroform peak (7.26 ppm for  1 H NMR and 77.23 for proton-decoupled  13 C NMR).  19 F NMR chemical shifts are reported relative to the external standard\nα,α,α-trifluorotoluene, δ −63.72. Data\nare represented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity ( s  = singlet,  d  = doublet,  t  = triplet,  q  = quartet,  m  = multiplet),\ncoupling constants ( J ) in Hertz (Hz), integration.\nHPLC traces were obtained using an Agilent 1260 Infinity instrument\nwith CHIRALPAK OJ-H or OD-H columns.\n\n## Crystallization of Single\nCrystals\n\nSingle crystals\nof ( R )- 1a , ( S )- 1a ,  1c ,  1e ,  1f ,  1h ,  1i ,  2c , and  2d  for\nX-ray analysis were prepared in 20 mL glass vials by slow evaporation\nfrom saturated acetone, ethanol, or dichloromethane solutions at room\ntemperature. The X-ray intensity data were recorded on a Bruker D8\nAPEX-II CCD system using graphite-monochromated and 0.5 mm MonoCap-collimated\nMo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) with the ω\nscan method at 100 K. The selected crystallographic parameters are\nlisted in  Table S1 . Crystallographic information\nfiles (CIFs), including the HKL and RES data, are deposited in the\nCCDC with numbers 2102296 (( R )- 1a ),\n2102297 (( S )- 1a ), 2102298 ( 1c ), 2102299 ( 1e ), 2102300 ( 1f ), 2102301\n( 1h ), 2102302 ( 1i ), 2102303 ( 2c ), and 2102304 ( 2d ).\n\n## Toxicological Assays\n\nThe lethality of solid-state forms\nof insecticide was determined by the residual exposure method. Each\ncrystalline form was ground to a particle size similar to the size\nof the amorphous or liquid droplets prepared by fine mist spraying.\nFor  D. melanogaster  flies, lethality measurements\nwere performed in duplicate for each compound, each accompanied by\ntwo controls (no insecticide). Each microcrystalline form was added\nto a 10 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish, which was subsequently\nshaken to disperse the microcrystals throughout the Petri dish. Amorphous\nor liquid forms were prepared by fine mist spraying a hexane stock\nsolution, with various concentrations in 10 mL hexane, onto the top\nand bottom of 10 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dishes (two sprays\n= 0.280 mL) and allowing the hexane to evaporate at room temperature.\nFlies were sedated with carbon dioxide (for 30 s), and 25 females\nwere transferred to each Petri dish. The top of the dish was then\nplaced over the bottom, and the motion of the flies was recorded with\na video camera (Sony HDR-CX455). The knockdown time was measured for\neach individual fly, with knockdown associated with an insect laying\non the bottom surface of the Petri dish in a supine position without\nmoving from its original position after 10 s.\n\nFor  Ae.\naegypti  mosquitoes, lethality measurements were performed\nin similar conditions as described for flies.  1a  microcrystalline\nform (ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg) was added to a 9 cm diameter polystyrene\nPetri dish, which was subsequently shaken to disperse the microcrystals\nthroughout the Petri dish, providing concentrations that ranged from\n1.25 to 12.5 μg/cm 2 . Twenty (4–9 days old)\nfemale mosquitoes were sedated with carbon dioxide (for 20 s) and\ntransferred to the 9 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish which was\nthen covered with a lid to prevent their escape. Three Petri dishes\ncontaining 20 female mosquitoes each (replicates) were used, totaling\n60 mosquitoes for each strain. The number of mosquitoes that were\nknocked down (i.e., an insect laying on the bottom surface of the\nPetri dish in a supine position without moving from its original position\nafter 10 s) was recorded every 5 min (for 40 min). For the vapor toxicity\nassay we used 1.0 mg of  1a  microcrystalline form, which\nwas subsequently shaken to disperse the microcrystals throughout the\nPetri dish, providing concentrations of 12.5 μg/cm 2 . On top of the treated Petri dish a second modified Petri dish was\nplaced. For that, a 9 cm diameter polystyrene Petri dish with a 7\ncm diameter hole was used to create a window, and a polyester netting\n(Shason Textile Inc., part number WSB532-111, white; 8.0 cm of diameter)\nwas fixed in the bottom of the modified Petri dish to prevent mosquitoes\nfrom making direct contact with the compound. This setup allowed the\nmosquitoes to be exposed to the vapor phase of compound  1a  only ( Figure  7 B).\nTwenty (4–9 days old) female mosquitoes were sedated with carbon\ndioxide (for 20 s) and transferred to the modified Petri dish which\nwas then covered with a lid to prevent their escape. Five replicates\n(i.e., modified Petri dishes containing 20 female mosquitoes each)\nwere used. The mortality was evaluated after 24 h of exposure.\n\n## Electrophysiology\nRecordings\n\nWe evaluated whether compound  1a  possesses\npyrethroid and DDT-like activities on the mosquito\nwild-type sodium channel (AaNa v 1-1). AaNa v 1-1\nchannels were expressed in  Xenopus  oocytes and functionally\ncharacterized using a two-electrode voltage clamp as previously described. 54 , 55  Briefly, the tail-current induced by compound  1a  and\ndeltamethrin (positive control) following a 100-pulse train of 5 ms\ndepolarization from −120 mV to 0 mV with 10 ms was measured. 56  We also tested the inhibitory effect of  1a  on channel inactivation in the DDT protocol 57  by measuring the remaining current at the end\nof a 500 ms depolarization to −10 mV from a holding potential\nof −120 mV.
