  "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the association between\nParkinson’s disease (PD) and occupational exposure to organic\nsolvents generally and chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHC) in\nparticular.MethodsWe assembled a Finland-wide case–control study for birth years\n1930–1950 by identifying incident PD cases from the register of\nReimbursement of Medical Costs and drawing two controls per case\nusing incidence density sampling from the Population Information\nSystem, matched on sex, birth year, and residency in Finland in\n1980–2014. Occupation and socioeconomic status (SES) were identified\nfrom national censuses. We assessed cumulative occupational\nexposures via FINJEM job-exposure matrix. Smoking was based on\noccupation-specific prevalence by sex from national surveys. We\nestimated confounder-adjusted PD incidence rate ratios (IRR) via\nlogistic regression and evaluated their sensitivity to errors in\nFINJEM through probabilistic bias analysis (PBA).ResultsAmong ever-employed, we identified 17 187 cases (16.0%\npotentially exposed to CHC) and 35 738 matched controls. Cases were\nmore likely to not smoke and belong to higher SES. Cumulative\nexposure (CE) to CHC (per 100 ppm-years, 5-year lag) was associated\nwith adjusted IRR 1.235 (95% confidence interval 0.986–1.547), with\nstronger associations among women and among persons who had more\ncensus records. Sensitivity analyses did not reveal notable\nassociations, but stronger effects were seen in the younger birth\ncohort (1940–1950). PBA produced notably weaker associations,\nyielding a median IRR 1.097 (95% simulation interval 0.920–1.291)\nfor CHC.ConclusionOur findings imply that PD is unlikely to be related to typical\noccupational solvent exposure in Finland, but excess risk cannot be\nruled out in some highly exposed occupations.",

PD\ncases (65 152 persons, first reimbursement) in 1965–2014 were obtained\nfrom the register of Reimbursement of Medical Costs for PD (code 110:\n“PD and comparable movement disorders”) maintained by the Social\nInsurance Institution of Finland (FSII) (figure 1). Reimbursement is\ngranted after submission of a medical certificate by the treating\nneurologist and review by medical experts of the FSII. Since 1990, the\nregister included the 9th and 10th revision of\nthe International Classification of Diseases [332 in ICD-9\n(1987–1995)], G20 in ICD-10 (since 1996) diagnosis code for some\npatients, and for all the patients since 2000. We selected as cases\npersons with reimbursement code 110 either with or without PD\ndiagnosis. In 95% of diagnosed cases, the diagnosis was “Parkinson\ndisease” in the 1990s. Using incidence density sampling, the\nPopulation Information System, maintained by the Digital and\nPopulation Data Services Agency, selected two potential controls per\ncase having the same sex and birth year, and living in Finland on the\ncase registration date (hereafter “index date”). Age of the controls\nat index date was within a year of the matching case. Data generation and data sources for the case–control study of\nParkinson's disease. One case was excluded because they elected to not share data for\nresearch, resulting in 49 145 cases and 98 290 controls for cases\nrestricted to 1980–2014. The study was restricted to Finnish- or\nSwedish-speaking subjects (813 excluded) aged 45–84 in the index years\n(13 062 excluded). PD is uncommon before 45 years of age (18) and genetic susceptibility may\ndominate over occupational factors at younger age (19). Under-ascertainment of PD\nbecomes more prominent after 85 years of age (20, 21). We\nfurther excluded 21 896 subjects due to the following, in part\noverlapping reasons: (i) 19 847 with no active censuses in 1970–1990\n[thus no information on exposure and thereby limiting study to those\nknown to have been ever-employed, smoking or socioeconomic status\n(SES)]; (ii) 972 born abroad (a heterogeneous group of persons from\nmany countries and not captured by oldest national censuses, and their\nrisk to get PD may differ not only from Finnish residents but also\nfrom their own source populations (22); (iii) 839 PD cases with reimbursement for\nAlzheimer disease before PD index date; and (iv) 790 potential\ncontrols who were registered for reimbursement of PD-related costs\nprior to control selection. The resulting sample included 36 621 cases\nand 75 041 controls. Differential matching between census data on occupations and\nworking age by birth year motivated further restriction of cases and\ncontrols. Due to the wide range of birth years, working age overlapped\npoorly with the occupational data (detailed below). Only for 8% of the\nsubjects, occupation could be determined for the entire typical\nworking life. For most of the subjects, the pre-census occupational\nhistory (1950–1967) was more than half of the entire working life\n(supplementary material, www.sjweh.fi/article/4125,\ntable S1), and thus was afflicted with lower quality of information\navailable to estimate exposure than the younger birth cohorts.\nConsequently, in an approach identical to Nielsen et al (17), we restricted the final study\npopulation to those born in 1930–1950 (17 187 cases and 35 738\ncontrols). Occupational history came in the form of occupational codes in the\ncensus records that were linked to the Finnish job-exposure matrix\ncalled FINJEM. Occupational histories were coded to match FINJEM 2016c\n(23) or FISCO88-FINJEM 2019\n(24). Using 11-digit personal\nidentification code, we linked the case–control data at Statistics\nFinland to 12 population censuses carried out every five years in\n1970–2000 and annually in 2004–2008. Censuses include codes for\noccupation and SES. Correspondence between population censuses, three\nclassification systems for the occupation codes in theses census, and\nFINJEM periods are presented in supplementary table S2. Three\noccupational classifications were used in the available censuses:\nClassification of Occupations of Statistics Finland’s longitudinal\nfile (LCF) in 1970–1985; Classification of Occupations 1980 (VAL80) in\n1990; and Classification of Occupations 2001 (FISCO88) in 1995–2008.\nAll of the 448 VAL80 occupational codes convert directly to a single\nFINJEM occupational code. However, seven of the 373 LCF occupational\ncodes, representing about 8% of the LCF data, split to two or more\nFINJEM codes, and 196 of the 445 FISCO88 occupational codes, about 74%\nof the FISCO88 data, split to two or more FINJEM codes. We addressed\nsplits following the method of Sallmen & Uuksulainen (25). We resolved about 45% of the\nsplit LCF codes in 1970–1985 into a single FINJEM code by examining\npersonal occupational histories backwards from the 1990 FINJEM code: a\nsingle FINJEM code was accepted for a split LCF code when the 1990\nFINJEM code was one of the split candidates. To resolve the split\nFISCO88 codes into FINJEM codes, we used forward examination of\noccupational histories between the 1990 FINJEM code and later FISCO88\ncodes. These solutions and direct FISCO88-FINJEM conversions totaled\nabout 88% of occupational codes in census 1995, but <50% in 2008\ndue to occupational changes. The remaining split FISCO88 occupational\ngroups are more heterogenous than actual FINJEM occupational groups\n(hereafter “FINJEM occupation”) and have low prevalence of solvent\nexposure, meaning that they were assessed as unexposed by FINJEM. In\nall the classifications, occupational groups include from a few up to\n100–150 individual occupational titles. FINJEM occupation for each year was assumed to be that in the\nclosest census (supplementary table S2). We considered the study\nsubject occupationally inactive if they had no occupational code,\noccupation was unknown, or were either student, pensioner, or\nunemployed. Exposure assessment was blind to PD status. Exposure was assessed\nfor 63 FINJEM agents with exposure estimates in FINJEM period\n1945–2009. For each subject, we calculated cumulative exposure (CE)\nsuch that each subject’s exposure histories were complete and fell\nwithin the years 1950–2008, following imputation of annual exposure in\nthe pre-census years that accounted for a pronounced increase in\nindustrialization over time (supplementary table S3). CE for each\nFINJEM agent was based on the person’s FINJEM occupation in each\ncensus, activity at census year, and FINJEM estimates for 1945–2009\n(supplementary table S2) in job exposure matrix (FINJEM 2016c or\nFISCO88–FINJEM 2019). In each calendar year, annual mean exposure for\neach agent was the product of activity (0/1), the annual backward\nstability coefficient (supplementary table S3, range 0–1 for the\npre-census years 1950–1967 and value 1 for 1968–2008; based on the\njudgement of the authors), the probability (P) and the average level\n(L; for solvents as ppm in the air) of exposure in a given FINJEM\noccupation and year. To assess CE for solvents as ppm-years, we summed\nthe annual exposure estimates from years the subject was 20–65 years\nuntil index (diagnosis or selection) year minus six years (minimum\nfive-year lag). We applied a minimum lag of five years because motor\nsymptoms of PD are present throughout this period (1), in particular to such an extent\nthat it is possible that these symptoms, for example leading to\ninjurious falls (2, 4), could impact the ability to work\nor conduct some tasks during this time. Risk estimates were made per\n100 ppm-years in order to make them relevant to typical exposures in\nFinland in 1960–1984, such that this level of accumulated exposure to\nchlorinated solvents would be reached by (a) typical persons in 5.5\nyears due to median level of exposure of 18 ppm and (b) the most\nexposed persons in 2 years due to maximum level of exposure of 50\nppm. SES (five categories: self-employed farmers, other self-employed\nentrepreneurs, upper-level employees, lower-level employees, manual\nworkers) was defined from the last active census in 1970–1990. FINJEM\noccupation- and sex-specific regular smoking prevalence (hereafter,\nsmoking prevalence) was derived from the annual health surveys in\n1978–1991 (prevalence estimates years) (26). Smoking prevalence for each subject was assessed\nfrom the FINJEM occupations during survey period (census order 1985,\n1980, and 1990) and, if missing, based on FINJEM occupations in 1975\nand 1970. For rare FINJEM occupations without smoking data, prevalence\nwas assumed to be that of closely related larger occupations. Because of the wide range of birth years (1896–1969), we extended\nthe occupational history to the years 1950–1967 using the earliest\navailable census record. In Finland, there was a pronounced\nindustrialization after World War II. Consequently, the industrial\nFINJEM occupation workforce in FINJEM period 1945–1959 was about half\nof that in 1960–1984 (23). To\naddress this, we created annual FINJEM occupation-specific backward\nstability coefficients for the pre-census years 1950–1967 (see\nsupplementary table S3). In assessing annual exposure in pre-census\nyears 1950–1967, FINJEM prevalence of exposure was multiplied by\nannual occupation-specific backward stability coefficients (range\n0–1). In line with industrialization, a monotonic increase in\nprevalence of solvent exposure from 1950–1967 was assumed for most\nsolvent-exposed occupations. However, in about 40 FINJEM occupations\nthe number of workers declined (eg, agricultural occupations), and\nstability of 1 was used for all years 1950–1967. Conventional analyses. We used SAS version 9.4\n(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC, USA) to analyze associations between CE\nto organic solvents and PD. We used unconditional logistic regression\nto estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% confidence\nintervals (Cs) (27). To control\nfor matching (28), we adjusted\nfor sex and birth year, and forced continuous smoking prevalence and\ncategorical SES into the multivariable model. In categorical analyses, the reference category for solvents and\nother FINJEM agents included persons unexposed in all the calendar\nyears used to compute CE. Based on numbers of potentially exposed\nsubject, two to four categories of exposure were defined for all the\nFINJEM agents with 10–20% of the exposed allocated to the highest\ncategory. We had few a priori confounders among occupational\nfactors. However, there are reasons to suspect that welding (in part\ndue to manganese and other metals) is implicated in PD (9). Therefore, we forced welding and\nchromium (strong correlate of nickel; manganese not assessed in FINJEM\ndue to its rarity in Finland) into multivariable models. Likewise,\ncorrelated aliphatic/alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents and aromatic\nhydrocarbon solvents (Pearson coefficient 0.76) were individually\nevaluated in multivariable models to check for potential confounding.\nWe retained potential occupational confounders in final analyses if\nthey altered IRR by 10% or more, as recommended by Maldonado &\nGreenland (29), while noting\nthat this should not be confused with definitive identification of any\ncovariate as true confounder (30). We conducted analyses stratified by sex, birth\ncohort, and the continuity of the same occupation (as number of\nsuccessive economically active censuses). Following conventional analysis, we evaluated the extent of bias\nthat the use of FINJEM to estimate cumulative occupational exposures\nmay have induced in the conventional analysis. Specifically, we focus\non bias due to estimation of occupational exposures for an occupation\nas a product of probability (P) (modified by the backward stability\ncoefficient where appropriate) and arithmetic mean (L). In doing so,\nwe followed the approach of PBA (31, 32). We\nutilized the exposure model developed by Burstyn et al (33) and default prior on variance of\noccupational exposures given in Method II of Jones & Burstyn\n(34). Technical details and SAS\nimplementation are presented in supplementary appendix 1; heuristic\noverview follows. We replaced each annual exposure estimate (the P×L)\nderived from linkage of FINJEM and census occupational records for\neach participant with values that reflect the chance that either (i)\nthe subject was truly unexposed, in which case zero was imputed\n(namely, if P=0, we kept the original unexposed status, but if P>0,\nthen a proportion of subjects equal to (1-P) were imputed as\nunexposed) or (ii) the subject was truly exposed, in which case an\nexposure from a lognormal distribution with arithmetic mean L and\nsimulated variance was imputed for the P proportion of subjects in a\ngiven occupation. The associations of CE and PD were estimated as in\nthe conventional analysis for each set of imputed exposures, with the\nfollowing caveat. We randomly sampled IRR from the distribution\ndefined by its point estimate and standard error. We summarized the\ndistribution of these sampled values, which reflect adjustment for\nbias due to both systematic errors (including aggregation bias due to\nFINJEM) and random errors across imputations, as a simulation interval\n(SI), in terms of its observed median, 2.5th and\n97.5th percentiles. We achieved stability in the estimated\nmedians of the IRR after 400 sets of imputed exposures. We also considered in a separate PBA that individuals who held the\nsame occupation in consecutive two to five censuses 1970 through 1990\nmay have had the same chance of being exposed during the entire\nperiod, not varying from year-to-year, referred hereafter as “the\nstability constraint”. Specifically, we simulated probability of\nhaving been exposed during such years of occupational stability based\non FINJEM assigned value of P arising from linkage to the first census\nrecord. For example, for subjects with the same occupation in five\ncensuses between 1970 and 1990, if the subject was simulated as having\nbeen exposed in 1970, they were classified as exposed throughout 1968\nto 1992 and unexposed otherwise. Exposure intensity in the exposed\nyears was derived from year-specific values of L as above. The rest of\nPBA analysis proceeded as described above."

We\nutilized the exposure model developed by Burstyn et al (33) and default prior on variance of\noccupational exposures given in Method II of Jones & Burstyn\n(34). Technical details and SAS\nimplementation are presented in supplementary appendix 1; heuristic\noverview follows. We replaced each annual exposure estimate (the P×L)\nderived from linkage of FINJEM and census occupational records for\neach participant with values that reflect the chance that either (i)\nthe subject was truly unexposed, in which case zero was imputed\n(namely, if P=0, we kept the original unexposed status, but if P>0,\nthen a proportion of subjects equal to (1-P) were imputed as\nunexposed) or (ii) the subject was truly exposed, in which case an\nexposure from a lognormal distribution with arithmetic mean L and\nsimulated variance was imputed for the P proportion of subjects in a\ngiven occupation. The associations of CE and PD were estimated as in\nthe conventional analysis for each set of imputed exposures, with the\nfollowing caveat. We randomly sampled IRR from the distribution\ndefined by its point estimate and standard error. We summarized the\ndistribution of these sampled values, which reflect adjustment for\nbias due to both systematic errors (including aggregation bias due to\nFINJEM) and random errors across imputations, as a simulation interval\n(SI), in terms of its observed median, 2.5th and\n97.5th percentiles. We achieved stability in the estimated\nmedians of the IRR after 400 sets of imputed exposures. We also considered in a separate PBA that individuals who held the\nsame occupation in consecutive two to five censuses 1970 through 1990\nmay have had the same chance of being exposed during the entire\nperiod, not varying from year-to-year, referred hereafter as “the\nstability constraint”. Specifically, we simulated probability of\nhaving been exposed during such years of occupational stability based\non FINJEM assigned value of P arising from linkage to the first census\nrecord. For example, for subjects with the same occupation in five\ncensuses between 1970 and 1990, if the subject was simulated as having\nbeen exposed in 1970, they were classified as exposed throughout 1968\nto 1992 and unexposed otherwise. Exposure intensity in the exposed\nyears was derived from year-specific values of L as above. The rest of\nPBA analysis proceeded as described above."

      "text": "Characteristics of PD cases and controls are presented in table 1. The distributions of matching\nvariables, birth year and sex, were similar in cases and controls.\nProportion of women reduced from 49% (original population) to 42% (final\nstudy population) due to higher total occupational inactivity in\ncensuses 1970–1990 compared to men (23.3% versus 6.8%). There was an\ninverse association with SES and PD. More controls smoked than cases.\nMean age of cases at index date was 66.38 years, range 44.11–84.68 and\nin controls 66.50 years, range 44.01–84.69. a Prevalence (probability) was based on\noccupation-specific prevalence of regular smoking for each sex\nderived from annual health surveys (see text for details); these\nwere divided into 5 rubrics for presentation, with different ranges\nfor men and women. The associations of PD and categorical CE to organic solvents are\nshown in table 2. A majority of\ncases and controls had no exposure to each organic solvent (Table 2), with 16.0% of cases ever\npotentially exposed to chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) solvents. We\nobserved that exposure to any CHC solvent at a level of 20 to 300\nppm-years (5-year lag) was associated on average with an increased risk\n(adjusted IRR 1.09, 95% CI 0.98–1.21). Among individual solvents,\nincreased adjusted IRR were observed in the highest exposure categories\nof 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.31) and methylene chloride\n(1.20, 95% CI 1.03–1.39). There was no evidence of association of PD\nwith exposure to other solvents. a Number of Parkinson’s disease cases in the\nrespective exposure category, and percent of the subjects in the\nrespective exposure category who are cases, based on 17 187 cases\nand 35 738 controls. These associations by exposure categories were reduced once we\nconsidered measurement error in exposure via PBA without the stability\nconstraint. Specifically, the estimated medians of IRR with the highest\ncategories became 1.06 [95% simulation interval (SI) 0.95–1.21], 1.04\n(95% SI 0.87–1.24), and 1.03 (95% SI 0.86–1.26), for CHC,\n1,1,1-trichloroethane, and methylene chloride, respectively. Except in trichloroethane, we did not observe a change in IRR close\nto 10% upon adjustment for a priori selected potential\nconfounder. Details of these analyses are shown in supplementary table\nS4. Therefore, specific occupational confounders were not considered\nfurther in our work. Conventional CHC analyses are summarized in table 3 using continuous cumulative exposure variable\nfor chlorinated hydrocarbons. They indicated that CE to CHC (per 100\nppm-years, 5-year lag) was associated with increased risk (IRR 1.237;\n95% CI 0.987–1.550), after accounting for matching variables and SES\n(IRR 0.987 (95% CI 0.919–1.060), 0.904 (95% CI 0.830–0.985), 0.977 (95%\nCI 0.918–1.041), and 0.925 (95% CI 0.867–0.986) for SES 1, 2, 4, and 5\ncompared to 3, respectively), and smoking (0.546; 95% CI 0.420–0.709).\nEffect estimates were stronger among women than men, and among persons\nwho were economically active in a greater number of censuses, most\nnotably among those active in all five censuses 1970–1990: CHC-IRR\n1.526, 95% CI 1.139–2.045. PBA finding that accounted for exposure measurement error are\nsummarized in table 3, alongside\nwith the corresponding conventional analyses. They showed weaker\nassociation for CHC, suggesting that the conventional estimates may have\nover-estimated IRR. Specifically, association with CE of CHC (100\nppm-years, 5-year lag) reduced to median IRR of 1.097 (95% SI\n0.920–1.291). Accounting for stability of occupational histories further\nreduced the estimate, with median IRR of 1.040 (95% SI 0.904–1.187).\nThere was a noticeable impact effect of PBA among the most economically\nactive persons in 1970–1990, with median IRR reducing to 1.169, 95% SI\n0.927–1.500. In conventional analysis, cumulative CHC exposure by 1930–1939 birth\ncohort shows lower IRR relative to the younger birth cohort (1940–1950),\nwhich had adjusted IRR 2.007 (95%CI 1.214–3.319) (table 3). This estimate for the 1940–1950 birth cohort\nreduced in PBA to the median IRR of 1.226 (95% SI 0.868–1.811) (table 3). We tested heterogeneity of\nIRR between birth cohorts after PBA via a Wald-type test and obtained\nP=0.15, implying that evidence for effects truly differing by birth\ncohort is weak. Effect estimate become weaker when occupational\nstability was assumed: IRR 1.090 (95% SI 0.916–1.285)."

      "text": "This nation-wide case–control study from Finland found no clear\nassociation between occupational exposure to solvents and PD.\nConventional analyses, using FINJEM exposure estimates, suggested\npositive association for CHC solvents but these findings were in large\npart related to aggregation bias (33). We observed the well documented inverse\nassociation of PD risk and smoking (35) and reproduced the positive association of PD and\nupper SES (36). The current case–control study and the study based on probability of\nexposure (P) in a single-census by Nielsen et al (17) used identical birth cohorts 1930-1950, but not\nidentical participants. Our findings were less sensitive than earlier\nwork to adjustment for other FINJEM factors. Potential for\ncollider-related bias of unexpected direction was higher in\nsingle-census study of Nielsen et al (17), and current approach addressed this. The risk estimates from the study of twins (11) are higher than those we observed. They are subject\nto several sources of bias and should be interpreted with caution. The\nexposure assessment method was inferior to FINJEM in that it was not\nanchored in measurements and has unknown misclassification rates. Given\nthat the exposure assessment employs a permissive definition of exposed\nas “at least 2% of work time or 1 hour per week” of either hobbies or\njobs, and low statistical power, false positives are highly likely\n(37, 38). The control for genetic confounding may be\nincomplete because results for monozygotic twins are not presented,\npresumably because there are too few for informative analysis. Our\nresults are not compatible with a six-fold increase in risk for any\never-exposure to CHC. The strength of our work lies in its large nation-wide sample, with\nfew missing data, and in the quality of information on smoking that\nvaried by sex and occupation, as well as accounting quantitatively for\nimpact of imperfection in exposure assessment, and mitigation through\nstudy design of bias due to outcome misclassification (ie, by limiting\nthe source cohort to years with records of PD diagnosis). The importance\nof our findings must be framed within consideration of confounding,\nmeasurement error and selection biases that may have affected our\nestimates. It is difficult for us to undertake a detailed examination of\npotential selection bias (related to both exposures and the outcome)\nwith respect to both outcomes and exposures because in case–control\ndesign we did not access exposure for the entire parent cohort. Such\nselection bias is always a concern and therefore our conclusions,\nstrictly speaking, only apply to native-born residents of Finland from\nspecific era and age, who were economically active (had census record)\nand had unambiguous diagnosis. Bias is unlikely to have arisen from\nincidence density sampling of controls. We addressed potential confounding by other occupational exposures\nthrough adjustment for estimates exposures to metals and solvents.\nHowever, the effect estimates with CHC did not alter enough to impact\ninterpretation of the results, with changes of the IRR under 10%. These\nadjustments for confounding may not have been complete, because there\nare no well-established risk factors for PD. Nonetheless, we did control\nfor smoking, one of the few established risk factors that varied by\noccupation and sex. If observed and latent confounding are of similar\nmagnitude (as is often argued, eg (39), the residual confounding in our analysis would\ncause bias of at most 10%. Misclassification of outcome can distort exposure-response\nassociations. Censoring identification of cases to under the age of 85\nyears helped to address the concern about under-diagnosis (17). We were aware of\nunder-representation of people over 80 years of age among PD cases in\nthe FSII register before 2010 and therefore restricted the study to\nbirth cohorts 1930–1950, who were ≤80 years in 2010. In another study\nusing FSII reimbursement register to identify PD cases, it was concluded\nthat different sources of bias are expected to cause some upward bias in\nthe incidence and prevalence figures (40), but we have no reason to\nbelieve that such bias would be related to solvent exposure, thereby\nbiasing our evaluation of occupation etiology of PD. Moreover, PD data\nof the reimbursement register includes perhaps 5% non-PD cases in the\n1980s and gradually fewer towards the late 1990s when increasing number\nof cases had exact diagnosis, and none thereafter. Those born in 1945\nwere 55 years old in 2000, when diagnostic data were no longer lacking.\nHowever, misclassification is more likely for those born in 1930’s and\ngetting PD at a younger age. Misclassification and errors in exposure estimates may have biased\nour results in a difficult-to-predict manner, even though exposure\nassessment was blinded to outcome ascertainment. Errors in exposure can\narise in our work from both inaccuracies in occupational histories and\nexposure assigned on the basis of occupational histories. We will deal\nwith the issue of errors in exposure estimates first. We addressed concern of exposure measurement error within\noccupational groups and the resulting aggregation bias through PBA. Our\nresults indicates that, in line with theory in Burstyn et al (33), the conventional estimates using\ncontinuous measure of CE are expected to be positively biased. This bias\narises in conventional analysis because in a group assessed as exposed\n“on average” there are (a) many unexposed persons whose exposure is\nover-estimated, (b) a few exposed persons whose exposure is\nunder-estimated. This has the consequence of shrinking assessed range of\nexposure relative to the true one, creating a tendency to over-estimate\nexposure-response slope [see figure 2 in Burstyn et al (33)]. However, there are many other\nfactors at play, such as proportion of truly exposed in a study sample\n(33). We think that one of the\nmost critical issues here is the low prevalence of solvent exposure. For\nCHC, the mode and median assigned probability of exposure per occupation\nwas about 5%. For trichloroethylene, 85% of all the potentially exposed\nwere employed in occupations with such low prevalence. Moreover, our\ndecision to extend the exposure assessment into pre-census years\n1950–1967 and the use of backward stability coefficients lead to very\nlow prevalence towards 1950 in most of the industrial exposing\noccupations. We undertook PBA to quantify the impact of the aggregation\nbias simulating possible true exposure distributions from observed data.\nIf our models and assumptions are correct, one can be certain that the\nsimulations are closer to the true value of IRR than the conventional\nanalyses. To summarize, confidence intervals of conventional analyses do\nnot have 95% coverage of effect estimates consistent with data and\nassumed models, when error in exposure is ignored. However, it is\nimportant to note that uncertainty bounds between conventional and PBA\nanalyses overlap, such that an argument can be made that both analyses\nare congruent to some degree. In conventional analyses, we assumed that occupation and exposure was\nstable in census year plus or minus two years and were identical across\ncensus records within a FINJEM period and similar between FINJEM\nperiods. We used two approaches in PBA: standard and stable. In standard\nPBA approach, exposure level was imputed independently in each calendar\nyear even with identical occupations within person. In stable PBA, we\nassumed that probability of exposure was the same across consecutive\ncensus records 1970–1990 within the same occupation for a participant.\nIn the case of PBA analyses of 1940–1950 birth cohort, this proved to be\nan important source of uncertainty that can account fully for suggested\npositive findings with CE to CHC. We do not know where the truth lies\nbetween the extremes of stable work and work changing from census to\ncensus. The backward stability coefficients were used to extrapolate exposure\nprevalence to time periods not covered by censuses when a rapid\nindustrialization took place in Finland after World War II. The use of\nbackward occupational stability coefficients helped us to get more\nrealistic occupational histories by assuming that the likelihood of the\ncensus 1970 occupation is gradually decreased towards 1950. Because of\nsmall backwards stability coefficients in many industrial occupations,\nthe coefficient-weighted probabilities for CHC solvents became very\nsmall towards 1950s. Backward stability was applied as a group-level\nfactor and therefore cannot account for inter-individual variability,\nthereby only partially addressing the problem of missing information on\nexposure during pre-census period. These coefficients as based on expert\njudgement and as such they are one of the limitations of the work. We\ndid consider knowledge of the timing of the introduction of solvents\nsuch that we did not extrapolate use of solvent back to the time when it\nwas not available for industrial use. Though we restricted the final\nstudy population to subjects born in 1930–1950, the findings may still\nbe more biased negatively in the oldest birth cohorts due to greater\nuncertainty in exposure assessment than in the younger birth cohorts\n(this can be further aggravated, as discussed above, by greater outcome\nmisclassification in the older birth cohorts). The patterns evident in\nboth the conventional analysis and PBA is consistent with this idea, if\nCHC is associated with PD. A healthy worker survivor effect means tendency of healthier persons\nto remain employed resulting to higher exposure estimates. In the\n1930–1950 birth cohorts, very few subjects supposedly have passed away\nbefore the start of follow-up in 1980 but leaving highly exposed jobs is\nmore likely, implying a negative bias. However, in 1930-1940 birth\ncohort premature deaths may have caused negative bias because heavy\nsolvent exposure is known to cause eg, chronic solvent encephalopathy.\nLimiting cases to those aged less than 85 years and stratifying analyses\nby sex, birth cohorts and having been economically active helps\nalleviate these concerns. However, accessing having been economically\nactive can be confounded by birth cohort. We conclude that association of PD among persons born 1930–1950 in\nFinland is unlikely to be attributed to their occupational exposure to\nsolvents, but neither the residual bias, nor excess risk at the\nextremes of exposure distribution can be ruled out. The suggestion of\na stronger effect in a younger cohort with better data may serve as a\nmotivation for future research due to greater relevance of these\nexposure to current working conditions in Finland. While our results\ndo not exclude the existence of the causal link, current evidence does\nnot support identification of chlorinated solvents as a major\npreventable cause of PD in Finland."

  "full_text": "## Methods\nEthics approval was not required for this register-based study. PD\ncases (65 152 persons, first reimbursement) in 1965–2014 were obtained\nfrom the register of Reimbursement of Medical Costs for PD (code 110:\n“PD and comparable movement disorders”) maintained by the Social\nInsurance Institution of Finland (FSII) (figure 1). Reimbursement is\ngranted after submission of a medical certificate by the treating\nneurologist and review by medical experts of the FSII. Since 1990, the\nregister included the 9th and 10th revision of\nthe International Classification of Diseases [332 in ICD-9\n(1987–1995)], G20 in ICD-10 (since 1996) diagnosis code for some\npatients, and for all the patients since 2000. We selected as cases\npersons with reimbursement code 110 either with or without PD\ndiagnosis. In 95% of diagnosed cases, the diagnosis was “Parkinson\ndisease” in the 1990s. Using incidence density sampling, the\nPopulation Information System, maintained by the Digital and\nPopulation Data Services Agency, selected two potential controls per\ncase having the same sex and birth year, and living in Finland on the\ncase registration date (hereafter “index date”). Age of the controls\nat index date was within a year of the matching case. Data generation and data sources for the case–control study of\nParkinson's disease. One case was excluded because they elected to not share data for\nresearch, resulting in 49 145 cases and 98 290 controls for cases\nrestricted to 1980–2014. The study was restricted to Finnish- or\nSwedish-speaking subjects (813 excluded) aged 45–84 in the index years\n(13 062 excluded). PD is uncommon before 45 years of age (18) and genetic susceptibility may\ndominate over occupational factors at younger age (19). Under-ascertainment of PD\nbecomes more prominent after 85 years of age (20, 21). We\nfurther excluded 21 896 subjects due to the following, in part\noverlapping reasons: (i) 19 847 with no active censuses in 1970–1990\n[thus no information on exposure and thereby limiting study to those\nknown to have been ever-employed, smoking or socioeconomic status\n(SES)]; (ii) 972 born abroad (a heterogeneous group of persons from\nmany countries and not captured by oldest national censuses, and their\nrisk to get PD may differ not only from Finnish residents but also\nfrom their own source populations (22); (iii) 839 PD cases with reimbursement for\nAlzheimer disease before PD index date; and (iv) 790 potential\ncontrols who were registered for reimbursement of PD-related costs\nprior to control selection. The resulting sample included 36 621 cases\nand 75 041 controls. Differential matching between census data on occupations and\nworking age by birth year motivated further restriction of cases and\ncontrols. Due to the wide range of birth years, working age overlapped\npoorly with the occupational data (detailed below). Only for 8% of the\nsubjects, occupation could be determined for the entire typical\nworking life. For most of the subjects, the pre-census occupational\nhistory (1950–1967) was more than half of the entire working life\n(supplementary material, www.sjweh.fi/article/4125,\ntable S1), and thus was afflicted with lower quality of information\navailable to estimate exposure than the younger birth cohorts.\nConsequently, in an approach identical to Nielsen et al (17), we restricted the final study\npopulation to those born in 1930–1950 (17 187 cases and 35 738\ncontrols). Occupational history came in the form of occupational codes in the\ncensus records that were linked to the Finnish job-exposure matrix\ncalled FINJEM. Occupational histories were coded to match FINJEM 2016c\n(23) or FISCO88-FINJEM 2019\n(24). Using 11-digit personal\nidentification code, we linked the case–control data at Statistics\nFinland to 12 population censuses carried out every five years in\n1970–2000 and annually in 2004–2008. Censuses include codes for\noccupation and SES. Correspondence between population censuses, three\nclassification systems for the occupation codes in theses census, and\nFINJEM periods are presented in supplementary table S2. Three\noccupational classifications were used in the available censuses:\nClassification of Occupations of Statistics Finland’s longitudinal\nfile (LCF) in 1970–1985; Classification of Occupations 1980 (VAL80) in\n1990; and Classification of Occupations 2001 (FISCO88) in 1995–2008.\nAll of the 448 VAL80 occupational codes convert directly to a single\nFINJEM occupational code. However, seven of the 373 LCF occupational\ncodes, representing about 8% of the LCF data, split to two or more\nFINJEM codes, and 196 of the 445 FISCO88 occupational codes, about 74%\nof the FISCO88 data, split to two or more FINJEM codes. We addressed\nsplits following the method of Sallmen & Uuksulainen (25). We resolved about 45% of the\nsplit LCF codes in 1970–1985 into a single FINJEM code by examining\npersonal occupational histories backwards from the 1990 FINJEM code: a\nsingle FINJEM code was accepted for a split LCF code when the 1990\nFINJEM code was one of the split candidates. To resolve the split\nFISCO88 codes into FINJEM codes, we used forward examination of\noccupational histories between the 1990 FINJEM code and later FISCO88\ncodes. These solutions and direct FISCO88-FINJEM conversions totaled\nabout 88% of occupational codes in census 1995, but <50% in 2008\ndue to occupational changes. The remaining split FISCO88 occupational\ngroups are more heterogenous than actual FINJEM occupational groups\n(hereafter “FINJEM occupation”) and have low prevalence of solvent\nexposure, meaning that they were assessed as unexposed by FINJEM. In\nall the classifications, occupational groups include from a few up to\n100–150 individual occupational titles. FINJEM occupation for each year was assumed to be that in the\nclosest census (supplementary table S2). We considered the study\nsubject occupationally inactive if they had no occupational code,\noccupation was unknown, or were either student, pensioner, or\nunemployed. Exposure assessment was blind to PD status. Exposure was assessed\nfor 63 FINJEM agents with exposure estimates in FINJEM period\n1945–2009. For each subject, we calculated cumulative exposure (CE)\nsuch that each subject’s exposure histories were complete and fell\nwithin the years 1950–2008, following imputation of annual exposure in\nthe pre-census years that accounted for a pronounced increase in\nindustrialization over time (supplementary table S3). CE for each\nFINJEM agent was based on the person’s FINJEM occupation in each\ncensus, activity at census year, and FINJEM estimates for 1945–2009\n(supplementary table S2) in job exposure matrix (FINJEM 2016c or\nFISCO88–FINJEM 2019). In each calendar year, annual mean exposure for\neach agent was the product of activity (0/1), the annual backward\nstability coefficient (supplementary table S3, range 0–1 for the\npre-census years 1950–1967 and value 1 for 1968–2008; based on the\njudgement of the authors), the probability (P) and the average level\n(L; for solvents as ppm in the air) of exposure in a given FINJEM\noccupation and year. To assess CE for solvents as ppm-years, we summed\nthe annual exposure estimates from years the subject was 20–65 years\nuntil index (diagnosis or selection) year minus six years (minimum\nfive-year lag). We applied a minimum lag of five years because motor\nsymptoms of PD are present throughout this period (1), in particular to such an extent\nthat it is possible that these symptoms, for example leading to\ninjurious falls (2, 4), could impact the ability to work\nor conduct some tasks during this time. Risk estimates were made per\n100 ppm-years in order to make them relevant to typical exposures in\nFinland in 1960–1984, such that this level of accumulated exposure to\nchlorinated solvents would be reached by (a) typical persons in 5.5\nyears due to median level of exposure of 18 ppm and (b) the most\nexposed persons in 2 years due to maximum level of exposure of 50\nppm. SES (five categories: self-employed farmers, other self-employed\nentrepreneurs, upper-level employees, lower-level employees, manual\nworkers) was defined from the last active census in 1970–1990. FINJEM\noccupation- and sex-specific regular smoking prevalence (hereafter,\nsmoking prevalence) was derived from the annual health surveys in\n1978–1991 (prevalence estimates years) (26). Smoking prevalence for each subject was assessed\nfrom the FINJEM occupations during survey period (census order 1985,\n1980, and 1990) and, if missing, based on FINJEM occupations in 1975\nand 1970. For rare FINJEM occupations without smoking data, prevalence\nwas assumed to be that of closely related larger occupations. Because of the wide range of birth years (1896–1969), we extended\nthe occupational history to the years 1950–1967 using the earliest\navailable census record. In Finland, there was a pronounced\nindustrialization after World War II. Consequently, the industrial\nFINJEM occupation workforce in FINJEM period 1945–1959 was about half\nof that in 1960–1984 (23). To\naddress this, we created annual FINJEM occupation-specific backward\nstability coefficients for the pre-census years 1950–1967 (see\nsupplementary table S3). In assessing annual exposure in pre-census\nyears 1950–1967, FINJEM prevalence of exposure was multiplied by\nannual occupation-specific backward stability coefficients (range\n0–1). In line with industrialization, a monotonic increase in\nprevalence of solvent exposure from 1950–1967 was assumed for most\nsolvent-exposed occupations. However, in about 40 FINJEM occupations\nthe number of workers declined (eg, agricultural occupations), and\nstability of 1 was used for all years 1950–1967. Conventional analyses. We used SAS version 9.4\n(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC, USA) to analyze associations between CE\nto organic solvents and PD. We used unconditional logistic regression\nto estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% confidence\nintervals (Cs) (27). To control\nfor matching (28), we adjusted\nfor sex and birth year, and forced continuous smoking prevalence and\ncategorical SES into the multivariable model. In categorical analyses, the reference category for solvents and\nother FINJEM agents included persons unexposed in all the calendar\nyears used to compute CE. Based on numbers of potentially exposed\nsubject, two to four categories of exposure were defined for all the\nFINJEM agents with 10–20% of the exposed allocated to the highest\ncategory. We had few a priori confounders among occupational\nfactors. However, there are reasons to suspect that welding (in part\ndue to manganese and other metals) is implicated in PD (9). Therefore, we forced welding and\nchromium (strong correlate of nickel; manganese not assessed in FINJEM\ndue to its rarity in Finland) into multivariable models. Likewise,\ncorrelated aliphatic/alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents and aromatic\nhydrocarbon solvents (Pearson coefficient 0.76) were individually\nevaluated in multivariable models to check for potential confounding.\nWe retained potential occupational confounders in final analyses if\nthey altered IRR by 10% or more, as recommended by Maldonado &\nGreenland (29), while noting\nthat this should not be confused with definitive identification of any\ncovariate as true confounder (30). We conducted analyses stratified by sex, birth\ncohort, and the continuity of the same occupation (as number of\nsuccessive economically active censuses). Following conventional analysis, we evaluated the extent of bias\nthat the use of FINJEM to estimate cumulative occupational exposures\nmay have induced in the conventional analysis. Specifically, we focus\non bias due to estimation of occupational exposures for an occupation\nas a product of probability (P) (modified by the backward stability\ncoefficient where appropriate) and arithmetic mean (L). In doing so,\nwe followed the approach of PBA (31, 32). We\nutilized the exposure model developed by Burstyn et al (33) and default prior on variance of\noccupational exposures given in Method II of Jones & Burstyn\n(34). Technical details and SAS\nimplementation are presented in supplementary appendix 1; heuristic\noverview follows. We replaced each annual exposure estimate (the P×L)\nderived from linkage of FINJEM and census occupational records for\neach participant with values that reflect the chance that either (i)\nthe subject was truly unexposed, in which case zero was imputed\n(namely, if P=0, we kept the original unexposed status, but if P>0,\nthen a proportion of subjects equal to (1-P) were imputed as\nunexposed) or (ii) the subject was truly exposed, in which case an\nexposure from a lognormal distribution with arithmetic mean L and\nsimulated variance was imputed for the P proportion of subjects in a\ngiven occupation. The associations of CE and PD were estimated as in\nthe conventional analysis for each set of imputed exposures, with the\nfollowing caveat. We randomly sampled IRR from the distribution\ndefined by its point estimate and standard error. We summarized the\ndistribution of these sampled values, which reflect adjustment for\nbias due to both systematic errors (including aggregation bias due to\nFINJEM) and random errors across imputations, as a simulation interval\n(SI), in terms of its observed median, 2.5th and\n97.5th percentiles. We achieved stability in the estimated\nmedians of the IRR after 400 sets of imputed exposures. We also considered in a separate PBA that individuals who held the\nsame occupation in consecutive two to five censuses 1970 through 1990\nmay have had the same chance of being exposed during the entire\nperiod, not varying from year-to-year, referred hereafter as “the\nstability constraint”. Specifically, we simulated probability of\nhaving been exposed during such years of occupational stability based\non FINJEM assigned value of P arising from linkage to the first census\nrecord. For example, for subjects with the same occupation in five\ncensuses between 1970 and 1990, if the subject was simulated as having\nbeen exposed in 1970, they were classified as exposed throughout 1968\nto 1992 and unexposed otherwise. Exposure intensity in the exposed\nyears was derived from year-specific values of L as above. The rest of\nPBA analysis proceeded as described above.\n\n## Selection of cases and controls\nEthics approval was not required for this register-based study. PD\ncases (65 152 persons, first reimbursement) in 1965–2014 were obtained\nfrom the register of Reimbursement of Medical Costs for PD (code 110:\n“PD and comparable movement disorders”) maintained by the Social\nInsurance Institution of Finland (FSII) (figure 1). Reimbursement is\ngranted after submission of a medical certificate by the treating\nneurologist and review by medical experts of the FSII. Since 1990, the\nregister included the 9th and 10th revision of\nthe International Classification of Diseases [332 in ICD-9\n(1987–1995)], G20 in ICD-10 (since 1996) diagnosis code for some\npatients, and for all the patients since 2000. We selected as cases\npersons with reimbursement code 110 either with or without PD\ndiagnosis. In 95% of diagnosed cases, the diagnosis was “Parkinson\ndisease” in the 1990s. Using incidence density sampling, the\nPopulation Information System, maintained by the Digital and\nPopulation Data Services Agency, selected two potential controls per\ncase having the same sex and birth year, and living in Finland on the\ncase registration date (hereafter “index date”). Age of the controls\nat index date was within a year of the matching case. Data generation and data sources for the case–control study of\nParkinson's disease. One case was excluded because they elected to not share data for\nresearch, resulting in 49 145 cases and 98 290 controls for cases\nrestricted to 1980–2014. The study was restricted to Finnish- or\nSwedish-speaking subjects (813 excluded) aged 45–84 in the index years\n(13 062 excluded). PD is uncommon before 45 years of age (18) and genetic susceptibility may\ndominate over occupational factors at younger age (19). Under-ascertainment of PD\nbecomes more prominent after 85 years of age (20, 21). We\nfurther excluded 21 896 subjects due to the following, in part\noverlapping reasons: (i) 19 847 with no active censuses in 1970–1990\n[thus no information on exposure and thereby limiting study to those\nknown to have been ever-employed, smoking or socioeconomic status\n(SES)]; (ii) 972 born abroad (a heterogeneous group of persons from\nmany countries and not captured by oldest national censuses, and their\nrisk to get PD may differ not only from Finnish residents but also\nfrom their own source populations (22); (iii) 839 PD cases with reimbursement for\nAlzheimer disease before PD index date; and (iv) 790 potential\ncontrols who were registered for reimbursement of PD-related costs\nprior to control selection. The resulting sample included 36 621 cases\nand 75 041 controls. Differential matching between census data on occupations and\nworking age by birth year motivated further restriction of cases and\ncontrols. Due to the wide range of birth years, working age overlapped\npoorly with the occupational data (detailed below). Only for 8% of the\nsubjects, occupation could be determined for the entire typical\nworking life. For most of the subjects, the pre-census occupational\nhistory (1950–1967) was more than half of the entire working life\n(supplementary material, www.sjweh.fi/article/4125,\ntable S1), and thus was afflicted with lower quality of information\navailable to estimate exposure than the younger birth cohorts.\nConsequently, in an approach identical to Nielsen et al (17), we restricted the final study\npopulation to those born in 1930–1950 (17 187 cases and 35 738\ncontrols).\n\n## Occupational histories\nOccupational history came in the form of occupational codes in the\ncensus records that were linked to the Finnish job-exposure matrix\ncalled FINJEM. Occupational histories were coded to match FINJEM 2016c\n(23) or FISCO88-FINJEM 2019\n(24). Using 11-digit personal\nidentification code, we linked the case–control data at Statistics\nFinland to 12 population censuses carried out every five years in\n1970–2000 and annually in 2004–2008. Censuses include codes for\noccupation and SES. Correspondence between population censuses, three\nclassification systems for the occupation codes in theses census, and\nFINJEM periods are presented in supplementary table S2. Three\noccupational classifications were used in the available censuses:\nClassification of Occupations of Statistics Finland’s longitudinal\nfile (LCF) in 1970–1985; Classification of Occupations 1980 (VAL80) in\n1990; and Classification of Occupations 2001 (FISCO88) in 1995–2008.\nAll of the 448 VAL80 occupational codes convert directly to a single\nFINJEM occupational code. However, seven of the 373 LCF occupational\ncodes, representing about 8% of the LCF data, split to two or more\nFINJEM codes, and 196 of the 445 FISCO88 occupational codes, about 74%\nof the FISCO88 data, split to two or more FINJEM codes. We addressed\nsplits following the method of Sallmen & Uuksulainen (25). We resolved about 45% of the\nsplit LCF codes in 1970–1985 into a single FINJEM code by examining\npersonal occupational histories backwards from the 1990 FINJEM code: a\nsingle FINJEM code was accepted for a split LCF code when the 1990\nFINJEM code was one of the split candidates. To resolve the split\nFISCO88 codes into FINJEM codes, we used forward examination of\noccupational histories between the 1990 FINJEM code and later FISCO88\ncodes. These solutions and direct FISCO88-FINJEM conversions totaled\nabout 88% of occupational codes in census 1995, but <50% in 2008\ndue to occupational changes. The remaining split FISCO88 occupational\ngroups are more heterogenous than actual FINJEM occupational groups\n(hereafter “FINJEM occupation”) and have low prevalence of solvent\nexposure, meaning that they were assessed as unexposed by FINJEM. In\nall the classifications, occupational groups include from a few up to\n100–150 individual occupational titles. FINJEM occupation for each year was assumed to be that in the\nclosest census (supplementary table S2). We considered the study\nsubject occupationally inactive if they had no occupational code,\noccupation was unknown, or were either student, pensioner, or\nunemployed.\n\n## Occupational exposure assessment\nExposure assessment was blind to PD status. Exposure was assessed\nfor 63 FINJEM agents with exposure estimates in FINJEM period\n1945–2009. For each subject, we calculated cumulative exposure (CE)\nsuch that each subject’s exposure histories were complete and fell\nwithin the years 1950–2008, following imputation of annual exposure in\nthe pre-census years that accounted for a pronounced increase in\nindustrialization over time (supplementary table S3). CE for each\nFINJEM agent was based on the person’s FINJEM occupation in each\ncensus, activity at census year, and FINJEM estimates for 1945–2009\n(supplementary table S2) in job exposure matrix (FINJEM 2016c or\nFISCO88–FINJEM 2019). In each calendar year, annual mean exposure for\neach agent was the product of activity (0/1), the annual backward\nstability coefficient (supplementary table S3, range 0–1 for the\npre-census years 1950–1967 and value 1 for 1968–2008; based on the\njudgement of the authors), the probability (P) and the average level\n(L; for solvents as ppm in the air) of exposure in a given FINJEM\noccupation and year. To assess CE for solvents as ppm-years, we summed\nthe annual exposure estimates from years the subject was 20–65 years\nuntil index (diagnosis or selection) year minus six years (minimum\nfive-year lag). We applied a minimum lag of five years because motor\nsymptoms of PD are present throughout this period (1), in particular to such an extent\nthat it is possible that these symptoms, for example leading to\ninjurious falls (2, 4), could impact the ability to work\nor conduct some tasks during this time. Risk estimates were made per\n100 ppm-years in order to make them relevant to typical exposures in\nFinland in 1960–1984, such that this level of accumulated exposure to\nchlorinated solvents would be reached by (a) typical persons in 5.5\nyears due to median level of exposure of 18 ppm and (b) the most\nexposed persons in 2 years due to maximum level of exposure of 50\nppm.\n\n## Covariate assessment\nSES (five categories: self-employed farmers, other self-employed\nentrepreneurs, upper-level employees, lower-level employees, manual\nworkers) was defined from the last active census in 1970–1990. FINJEM\noccupation- and sex-specific regular smoking prevalence (hereafter,\nsmoking prevalence) was derived from the annual health surveys in\n1978–1991 (prevalence estimates years) (26). Smoking prevalence for each subject was assessed\nfrom the FINJEM occupations during survey period (census order 1985,\n1980, and 1990) and, if missing, based on FINJEM occupations in 1975\nand 1970. For rare FINJEM occupations without smoking data, prevalence\nwas assumed to be that of closely related larger occupations. Because of the wide range of birth years (1896–1969), we extended\nthe occupational history to the years 1950–1967 using the earliest\navailable census record. In Finland, there was a pronounced\nindustrialization after World War II. Consequently, the industrial\nFINJEM occupation workforce in FINJEM period 1945–1959 was about half\nof that in 1960–1984 (23). To\naddress this, we created annual FINJEM occupation-specific backward\nstability coefficients for the pre-census years 1950–1967 (see\nsupplementary table S3). In assessing annual exposure in pre-census\nyears 1950–1967, FINJEM prevalence of exposure was multiplied by\nannual occupation-specific backward stability coefficients (range\n0–1). In line with industrialization, a monotonic increase in\nprevalence of solvent exposure from 1950–1967 was assumed for most\nsolvent-exposed occupations. However, in about 40 FINJEM occupations\nthe number of workers declined (eg, agricultural occupations), and\nstability of 1 was used for all years 1950–1967.\n\n## Statistical analyses\nConventional analyses. We used SAS version 9.4\n(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC, USA) to analyze associations between CE\nto organic solvents and PD. We used unconditional logistic regression\nto estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and their 95% confidence\nintervals (Cs) (27). To control\nfor matching (28), we adjusted\nfor sex and birth year, and forced continuous smoking prevalence and\ncategorical SES into the multivariable model. In categorical analyses, the reference category for solvents and\nother FINJEM agents included persons unexposed in all the calendar\nyears used to compute CE. Based on numbers of potentially exposed\nsubject, two to four categories of exposure were defined for all the\nFINJEM agents with 10–20% of the exposed allocated to the highest\ncategory. We had few a priori confounders among occupational\nfactors. However, there are reasons to suspect that welding (in part\ndue to manganese and other metals) is implicated in PD (9). Therefore, we forced welding and\nchromium (strong correlate of nickel; manganese not assessed in FINJEM\ndue to its rarity in Finland) into multivariable models. Likewise,\ncorrelated aliphatic/alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents and aromatic\nhydrocarbon solvents (Pearson coefficient 0.76) were individually\nevaluated in multivariable models to check for potential confounding.\nWe retained potential occupational confounders in final analyses if\nthey altered IRR by 10% or more, as recommended by Maldonado &\nGreenland (29), while noting\nthat this should not be confused with definitive identification of any\ncovariate as true confounder (30). We conducted analyses stratified by sex, birth\ncohort, and the continuity of the same occupation (as number of\nsuccessive economically active censuses).\n\n## Probabilistic bias analysis (PBA) to account for elements of\nexposure measurement error\nFollowing conventional analysis, we evaluated the extent of bias\nthat the use of FINJEM to estimate cumulative occupational exposures\nmay have induced in the conventional analysis. Specifically, we focus\non bias due to estimation of occupational exposures for an occupation\nas a product of probability (P) (modified by the backward stability\ncoefficient where appropriate) and arithmetic mean (L). In doing so,\nwe followed the approach of PBA (31, 32). We\nutilized the exposure model developed by Burstyn et al (33) and default prior on variance of\noccupational exposures given in Method II of Jones & Burstyn\n(34). Technical details and SAS\nimplementation are presented in supplementary appendix 1; heuristic\noverview follows. We replaced each annual exposure estimate (the P×L)\nderived from linkage of FINJEM and census occupational records for\neach participant with values that reflect the chance that either (i)\nthe subject was truly unexposed, in which case zero was imputed\n(namely, if P=0, we kept the original unexposed status, but if P>0,\nthen a proportion of subjects equal to (1-P) were imputed as\nunexposed) or (ii) the subject was truly exposed, in which case an\nexposure from a lognormal distribution with arithmetic mean L and\nsimulated variance was imputed for the P proportion of subjects in a\ngiven occupation. The associations of CE and PD were estimated as in\nthe conventional analysis for each set of imputed exposures, with the\nfollowing caveat. We randomly sampled IRR from the distribution\ndefined by its point estimate and standard error. We summarized the\ndistribution of these sampled values, which reflect adjustment for\nbias due to both systematic errors (including aggregation bias due to\nFINJEM) and random errors across imputations, as a simulation interval\n(SI), in terms of its observed median, 2.5th and\n97.5th percentiles. We achieved stability in the estimated\nmedians of the IRR after 400 sets of imputed exposures. We also considered in a separate PBA that individuals who held the\nsame occupation in consecutive two to five censuses 1970 through 1990\nmay have had the same chance of being exposed during the entire\nperiod, not varying from year-to-year, referred hereafter as “the\nstability constraint”. Specifically, we simulated probability of\nhaving been exposed during such years of occupational stability based\non FINJEM assigned value of P arising from linkage to the first census\nrecord. For example, for subjects with the same occupation in five\ncensuses between 1970 and 1990, if the subject was simulated as having\nbeen exposed in 1970, they were classified as exposed throughout 1968\nto 1992 and unexposed otherwise. Exposure intensity in the exposed\nyears was derived from year-specific values of L as above. The rest of\nPBA analysis proceeded as described above.\n\n## Results\nCharacteristics of PD cases and controls are presented in table 1. The distributions of matching\nvariables, birth year and sex, were similar in cases and controls.\nProportion of women reduced from 49% (original population) to 42% (final\nstudy population) due to higher total occupational inactivity in\ncensuses 1970–1990 compared to men (23.3% versus 6.8%). There was an\ninverse association with SES and PD. More controls smoked than cases.\nMean age of cases at index date was 66.38 years, range 44.11–84.68 and\nin controls 66.50 years, range 44.01–84.69. a Prevalence (probability) was based on\noccupation-specific prevalence of regular smoking for each sex\nderived from annual health surveys (see text for details); these\nwere divided into 5 rubrics for presentation, with different ranges\nfor men and women. The associations of PD and categorical CE to organic solvents are\nshown in table 2. A majority of\ncases and controls had no exposure to each organic solvent (Table 2), with 16.0% of cases ever\npotentially exposed to chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) solvents. We\nobserved that exposure to any CHC solvent at a level of 20 to 300\nppm-years (5-year lag) was associated on average with an increased risk\n(adjusted IRR 1.09, 95% CI 0.98–1.21). Among individual solvents,\nincreased adjusted IRR were observed in the highest exposure categories\nof 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.31) and methylene chloride\n(1.20, 95% CI 1.03–1.39). There was no evidence of association of PD\nwith exposure to other solvents. a Number of Parkinson’s disease cases in the\nrespective exposure category, and percent of the subjects in the\nrespective exposure category who are cases, based on 17 187 cases\nand 35 738 controls. These associations by exposure categories were reduced once we\nconsidered measurement error in exposure via PBA without the stability\nconstraint. Specifically, the estimated medians of IRR with the highest\ncategories became 1.06 [95% simulation interval (SI) 0.95–1.21], 1.04\n(95% SI 0.87–1.24), and 1.03 (95% SI 0.86–1.26), for CHC,\n1,1,1-trichloroethane, and methylene chloride, respectively. Except in trichloroethane, we did not observe a change in IRR close\nto 10% upon adjustment for a priori selected potential\nconfounder. Details of these analyses are shown in supplementary table\nS4. Therefore, specific occupational confounders were not considered\nfurther in our work. Conventional CHC analyses are summarized in table 3 using continuous cumulative exposure variable\nfor chlorinated hydrocarbons. They indicated that CE to CHC (per 100\nppm-years, 5-year lag) was associated with increased risk (IRR 1.237;\n95% CI 0.987–1.550), after accounting for matching variables and SES\n(IRR 0.987 (95% CI 0.919–1.060), 0.904 (95% CI 0.830–0.985), 0.977 (95%\nCI 0.918–1.041), and 0.925 (95% CI 0.867–0.986) for SES 1, 2, 4, and 5\ncompared to 3, respectively), and smoking (0.546; 95% CI 0.420–0.709).\nEffect estimates were stronger among women than men, and among persons\nwho were economically active in a greater number of censuses, most\nnotably among those active in all five censuses 1970–1990: CHC-IRR\n1.526, 95% CI 1.139–2.045. PBA finding that accounted for exposure measurement error are\nsummarized in table 3, alongside\nwith the corresponding conventional analyses. They showed weaker\nassociation for CHC, suggesting that the conventional estimates may have\nover-estimated IRR. Specifically, association with CE of CHC (100\nppm-years, 5-year lag) reduced to median IRR of 1.097 (95% SI\n0.920–1.291). Accounting for stability of occupational histories further\nreduced the estimate, with median IRR of 1.040 (95% SI 0.904–1.187).\nThere was a noticeable impact effect of PBA among the most economically\nactive persons in 1970–1990, with median IRR reducing to 1.169, 95% SI\n0.927–1.500. In conventional analysis, cumulative CHC exposure by 1930–1939 birth\ncohort shows lower IRR relative to the younger birth cohort (1940–1950),\nwhich had adjusted IRR 2.007 (95%CI 1.214–3.319) (table 3). This estimate for the 1940–1950 birth cohort\nreduced in PBA to the median IRR of 1.226 (95% SI 0.868–1.811) (table 3). We tested heterogeneity of\nIRR between birth cohorts after PBA via a Wald-type test and obtained\nP=0.15, implying that evidence for effects truly differing by birth\ncohort is weak. Effect estimate become weaker when occupational\nstability was assumed: IRR 1.090 (95% SI 0.916–1.285).\n\n## Discussion\nThis nation-wide case–control study from Finland found no clear\nassociation between occupational exposure to solvents and PD.\nConventional analyses, using FINJEM exposure estimates, suggested\npositive association for CHC solvents but these findings were in large\npart related to aggregation bias (33). We observed the well documented inverse\nassociation of PD risk and smoking (35) and reproduced the positive association of PD and\nupper SES (36). The current case–control study and the study based on probability of\nexposure (P) in a single-census by Nielsen et al (17) used identical birth cohorts 1930-1950, but not\nidentical participants. Our findings were less sensitive than earlier\nwork to adjustment for other FINJEM factors. Potential for\ncollider-related bias of unexpected direction was higher in\nsingle-census study of Nielsen et al (17), and current approach addressed this. The risk estimates from the study of twins (11) are higher than those we observed. They are subject\nto several sources of bias and should be interpreted with caution. The\nexposure assessment method was inferior to FINJEM in that it was not\nanchored in measurements and has unknown misclassification rates. Given\nthat the exposure assessment employs a permissive definition of exposed\nas “at least 2% of work time or 1 hour per week” of either hobbies or\njobs, and low statistical power, false positives are highly likely\n(37, 38). The control for genetic confounding may be\nincomplete because results for monozygotic twins are not presented,\npresumably because there are too few for informative analysis. Our\nresults are not compatible with a six-fold increase in risk for any\never-exposure to CHC. The strength of our work lies in its large nation-wide sample, with\nfew missing data, and in the quality of information on smoking that\nvaried by sex and occupation, as well as accounting quantitatively for\nimpact of imperfection in exposure assessment, and mitigation through\nstudy design of bias due to outcome misclassification (ie, by limiting\nthe source cohort to years with records of PD diagnosis). The importance\nof our findings must be framed within consideration of confounding,\nmeasurement error and selection biases that may have affected our\nestimates. It is difficult for us to undertake a detailed examination of\npotential selection bias (related to both exposures and the outcome)\nwith respect to both outcomes and exposures because in case–control\ndesign we did not access exposure for the entire parent cohort. Such\nselection bias is always a concern and therefore our conclusions,\nstrictly speaking, only apply to native-born residents of Finland from\nspecific era and age, who were economically active (had census record)\nand had unambiguous diagnosis. Bias is unlikely to have arisen from\nincidence density sampling of controls. We addressed potential confounding by other occupational exposures\nthrough adjustment for estimates exposures to metals and solvents.\nHowever, the effect estimates with CHC did not alter enough to impact\ninterpretation of the results, with changes of the IRR under 10%. These\nadjustments for confounding may not have been complete, because there\nare no well-established risk factors for PD. Nonetheless, we did control\nfor smoking, one of the few established risk factors that varied by\noccupation and sex. If observed and latent confounding are of similar\nmagnitude (as is often argued, eg (39), the residual confounding in our analysis would\ncause bias of at most 10%. Misclassification of outcome can distort exposure-response\nassociations. Censoring identification of cases to under the age of 85\nyears helped to address the concern about under-diagnosis (17). We were aware of\nunder-representation of people over 80 years of age among PD cases in\nthe FSII register before 2010 and therefore restricted the study to\nbirth cohorts 1930–1950, who were ≤80 years in 2010. In another study\nusing FSII reimbursement register to identify PD cases, it was concluded\nthat different sources of bias are expected to cause some upward bias in\nthe incidence and prevalence figures (40), but we have no reason to\nbelieve that such bias would be related to solvent exposure, thereby\nbiasing our evaluation of occupation etiology of PD. Moreover, PD data\nof the reimbursement register includes perhaps 5% non-PD cases in the\n1980s and gradually fewer towards the late 1990s when increasing number\nof cases had exact diagnosis, and none thereafter. Those born in 1945\nwere 55 years old in 2000, when diagnostic data were no longer lacking.\nHowever, misclassification is more likely for those born in 1930’s and\ngetting PD at a younger age. Misclassification and errors in exposure estimates may have biased\nour results in a difficult-to-predict manner, even though exposure\nassessment was blinded to outcome ascertainment. Errors in exposure can\narise in our work from both inaccuracies in occupational histories and\nexposure assigned on the basis of occupational histories. We will deal\nwith the issue of errors in exposure estimates first. We addressed concern of exposure measurement error within\noccupational groups and the resulting aggregation bias through PBA. Our\nresults indicates that, in line with theory in Burstyn et al (33), the conventional estimates using\ncontinuous measure of CE are expected to be positively biased. This bias\narises in conventional analysis because in a group assessed as exposed\n“on average” there are (a) many unexposed persons whose exposure is\nover-estimated, (b) a few exposed persons whose exposure is\nunder-estimated. This has the consequence of shrinking assessed range of\nexposure relative to the true one, creating a tendency to over-estimate\nexposure-response slope [see figure 2 in Burstyn et al (33)]. However, there are many other\nfactors at play, such as proportion of truly exposed in a study sample\n(33). We think that one of the\nmost critical issues here is the low prevalence of solvent exposure. For\nCHC, the mode and median assigned probability of exposure per occupation\nwas about 5%. For trichloroethylene, 85% of all the potentially exposed\nwere employed in occupations with such low prevalence. Moreover, our\ndecision to extend the exposure assessment into pre-census years\n1950–1967 and the use of backward stability coefficients lead to very\nlow prevalence towards 1950 in most of the industrial exposing\noccupations. We undertook PBA to quantify the impact of the aggregation\nbias simulating possible true exposure distributions from observed data.\nIf our models and assumptions are correct, one can be certain that the\nsimulations are closer to the true value of IRR than the conventional\nanalyses. To summarize, confidence intervals of conventional analyses do\nnot have 95% coverage of effect estimates consistent with data and\nassumed models, when error in exposure is ignored. However, it is\nimportant to note that uncertainty bounds between conventional and PBA\nanalyses overlap, such that an argument can be made that both analyses\nare congruent to some degree. In conventional analyses, we assumed that occupation and exposure was\nstable in census year plus or minus two years and were identical across\ncensus records within a FINJEM period and similar between FINJEM\nperiods. We used two approaches in PBA: standard and stable. In standard\nPBA approach, exposure level was imputed independently in each calendar\nyear even with identical occupations within person. In stable PBA, we\nassumed that probability of exposure was the same across consecutive\ncensus records 1970–1990 within the same occupation for a participant.\nIn the case of PBA analyses of 1940–1950 birth cohort, this proved to be\nan important source of uncertainty that can account fully for suggested\npositive findings with CE to CHC. We do not know where the truth lies\nbetween the extremes of stable work and work changing from census to\ncensus. The backward stability coefficients were used to extrapolate exposure\nprevalence to time periods not covered by censuses when a rapid\nindustrialization took place in Finland after World War II. The use of\nbackward occupational stability coefficients helped us to get more\nrealistic occupational histories by assuming that the likelihood of the\ncensus 1970 occupation is gradually decreased towards 1950. Because of\nsmall backwards stability coefficients in many industrial occupations,\nthe coefficient-weighted probabilities for CHC solvents became very\nsmall towards 1950s. Backward stability was applied as a group-level\nfactor and therefore cannot account for inter-individual variability,\nthereby only partially addressing the problem of missing information on\nexposure during pre-census period. These coefficients as based on expert\njudgement and as such they are one of the limitations of the work. We\ndid consider knowledge of the timing of the introduction of solvents\nsuch that we did not extrapolate use of solvent back to the time when it\nwas not available for industrial use. Though we restricted the final\nstudy population to subjects born in 1930–1950, the findings may still\nbe more biased negatively in the oldest birth cohorts due to greater\nuncertainty in exposure assessment than in the younger birth cohorts\n(this can be further aggravated, as discussed above, by greater outcome\nmisclassification in the older birth cohorts). The patterns evident in\nboth the conventional analysis and PBA is consistent with this idea, if\nCHC is associated with PD. A healthy worker survivor effect means tendency of healthier persons\nto remain employed resulting to higher exposure estimates. In the\n1930–1950 birth cohorts, very few subjects supposedly have passed away\nbefore the start of follow-up in 1980 but leaving highly exposed jobs is\nmore likely, implying a negative bias. However, in 1930-1940 birth\ncohort premature deaths may have caused negative bias because heavy\nsolvent exposure is known to cause eg, chronic solvent encephalopathy.\nLimiting cases to those aged less than 85 years and stratifying analyses\nby sex, birth cohorts and having been economically active helps\nalleviate these concerns. However, accessing having been economically\nactive can be confounded by birth cohort. We conclude that association of PD among persons born 1930–1950 in\nFinland is unlikely to be attributed to their occupational exposure to\nsolvents, but neither the residual bias, nor excess risk at the\nextremes of exposure distribution can be ruled out. The suggestion of\na stronger effect in a younger cohort with better data may serve as a\nmotivation for future research due to greater relevance of these\nexposure to current working conditions in Finland. While our results\ndo not exclude the existence of the causal link, current evidence does\nnot support identification of chlorinated solvents as a major\npreventable cause of PD in Finland.\n\n## Concluding remarks\nWe conclude that association of PD among persons born 1930–1950 in\nFinland is unlikely to be attributed to their occupational exposure to\nsolvents, but neither the residual bias, nor excess risk at the\nextremes of exposure distribution can be ruled out.
