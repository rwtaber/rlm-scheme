This\nstudy sheds light on the role of carbonyl compounds in the formation\nof N-nitrosamines by nitrosation of five secondary\namines via different pathways. The results showed that compared to\na control system, the presence of formaldehyde enhances the formation\nof N-nitrosamines by a factor of 5–152 at\npH 7, depending on the structure of the secondary amines. Acetaldehyde\nshowed a slight enhancement effect on N-nitrosamine\nformation, while acetone and benzaldehyde did not promote nitrosation\nreactions.

      "text": "N-Nitrosamines\nare potential human carcinogens,\nwhich can be present in food and consumables, but are also formed\nas disinfection byproducts during oxidative water and wastewater treatment\nby reactions of chlorine, chloramines, and ozone with nitrogen-containing\ncompounds.1−3 The formation and mitigation of N-nitrosamines has been extensively investigated in the last decades\nin engineered aquatic systems.4−7 Six N-nitrosamines that potentially\noccur in aquatic systems are currently on the US EPA Contaminant Candidate\nList 5 (CCL5) in the group “disinfection byproducts”.8 For example, N-nitrosodimethylamine\n(NDMA), the most commonly detected N-nitrosamine\nin drinking water and wastewater, poses a 10–6 cancer\nrisk at a concentration of 0.7 ng/L.1 In\ncontrast, the concentration of chloroform for the same cancer risk\nis 6 μg/L, which corresponds to about a 1000-fold lower toxicity\nthan NDMA.9 Drinking water guidelines for\nNDMA were established to be 100 and 40 ng/L by the World Health Organization\n(WHO)10 and the Canadian health authorities,11 respectively. A notification level of 10 ng/L\nwas set for 3 N-nitrosamines by California’s\nDepartment of Public Health (CDPH).12 Even though in water treatment, oxidation processes and especially\nchloramination are the main drivers for N-nitrosamine\nformation,2,13 nitrosation processes may become an important\npathway when secondary amines, nitrite, and carbonyl compounds are\npresent simultaneously in engineered aquatic systems (e.g., in sewer\nsystems or wastewater treatment plants where municipal and industrial\nwastewaters are mixed).14,15 They are common wastewater\ncomponents and their concentrations can reach up to tens of mg/L.16−21 One case in point, which may be a consequence of the reactions of\nthese compounds, is a survey on N-nitrosamines in\nindustrial wastewaters in Switzerland, in which N-nitrosamine concentrations of almost 1 mg/L were detected.22 Nitrosation reactions can also occur in water\nsystems receiving effluents from industrial cooling or hydraulic fracturing\nprocesses,23,24 amine-based CO2 capture\nsystems,25 food processing26 and GAC-based methods for N-nitrosamine\nanalysis.27 Nitrite itself is a weak nitrosating\nagent, however, it enhances N-nitrosamine formation\nat low pH (<6) by production of strong nitrosating agents such\nas dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) and nitrosyl halides\n(XNO, X = Cl–/Br–) (eqs 1–3).28 The corresponding second-order rate\nconstants for the reactions with secondary amines are in the order\nof 106–109 M–1 s–1 (eqs 4, 5 and Scheme 1a).2912345 N-Nitrosamine\nformation in (a) the absence28 and (b)\nthe presence30 of carbonyl compounds. (c)\nEquilibria for the reactions between secondary amines and carbonyl\ncompounds,33 and (d) N-nitrosamine formation from simple tertiary amines.34 The nitrosation process is most\nfavorable under acidic conditions\n(Scheme 1a). Nevertheless,\nunder neutral and basic conditions, an alternative pathway for N-nitrosamine formation proceeds via formaldehyde and chloral\ncatalysts (Scheme 1b).30 The proposed N-nitrosamine\nformation mechanism in the presence of carbonyl compounds includes\nan initial reaction between secondary amines and carbonyl compounds\n(Scheme 1c).31 This reaction yields a carbinolamine, which\neasily releases a hydroxyl group to yield an iminium ion. Iminium\nions are known to have high reactivity with nucleophiles such as nitrite,\nwhich yields N-nitrosamines and the parent carbonyl\ncompounds (Scheme 1b).30 However, iminium ions are unstable\nand hydrolyze rapidly in aqueous solutions. One case in point is H2C = N+(CH3)CH2CF3, an aliphatic iminium ion which has a hydrolysis rate constant of\n(1.8 ± 0.1) × 107 s–1 and a\nlifetime of (5.5 ± 0.3) × 10–8 s.32 Therefore, the transient concentrations of iminium\nions in aqueous solutions are extremely low and may not be relevant\nto the formation of significant concentrations of N-nitrosamine in aquatic systems. Carbinolamines, the precursors\nof iminium ions, are always in equilibrium\nwith secondary amines and iminium ions in aqueous solution (Scheme 1c). They are tertiary\namine-type compounds and may also be involved in the nitrosation process\nwith formation of the corresponding N-nitrosamines.35,36 Previous studies suggest that tertiary amines may first undergo\na dealkylation process to yield a secondary amine, which can then\nbe nitrosated to N-nitrosamine (Scheme 1d).34 In their neutral form, tertiary amines also have a lone electron\npair on the amine nitrogen, which may attack N2O3, similar to the case of secondary amines. Meanwhile, the dissociation\nconstant (Ka) of carbinolamines was reported\nto be 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the parent\nsecondary amines.33 This means that a higher\nfraction of carbinolamine is in its neutral form at the same pH value,\nwhich can contribute to the formation of the corresponding N-nitrosamine. To assess the extent of nitrosation reactions\nin the presence of carbonyl compounds, kinetic and mechanistic information\nabout N-nitrosamine formation is needed. This\nstudy investigated the N-nitrosamine formation\nby nitrosation in nitrite- and carbonyl compound-containing solutions.\nThe objectives of this study were (1) to elucidate the formation kinetics\nof N-nitrosamines from secondary amines in the pH-range\n4–8 and (2) to investigate the mechanisms of N-nitrosamine formation including different potential precursors such\nas secondary amines, carbinolamines, and iminium ions. In addition,\nquantum chemical computations and kinetic simulations were performed\nto support the proposed mechanism, allowing a comprehensive understanding\nof the fate of different reactive species during nitrosation. Finally,\nnitrosation processes were assessed for different water qualities\nby kinetic modeling."

      "text": "Figures 1a–e depict the N-nitrosamine\nformation kinetics resulting from the nitrosation of five secondary\namines (10 mM) in the absence and presence of formaldehyde (10 mM)\nat pH 7 with a nitrite concentration of 50 mM. The observed rates\nof N-nitrosamine formation (rtotal) in the absence of formaldehyde are low for all secondary\namines, except for MOR (Figure 1e). The formation kinetics decreased in the following order:\nNMOR (0.17 μM min–1) ≫ NDMA (3.09 ×\n10–3 μM min–1) > NMEA\n(6.41\n× 10–4 μM min–1) >\nNPYR (3.69 × 10–4 μM min–1) > NDEA (1.62 × 10–4 μM min–1). In the presence of nitrite, nitrosation of secondary\namine occurs\nmainly through N2O3 (1.5 × 10–13 M in equilibrium with NO2–, eqs S4–S6 in Text S2) by a nucleophilic\nattack.34 Second-order rate constants for\nthe reactions of N2O3 with the selected secondary\namines were determined in this study (Text S6 and Figures S11 and 12) to be in the range of 2.3 × 107 to 2.1 × 108 M–1 s–1 (Table S4). This is comparable\nto previously reported values within a factor of 1.3 to 3.8 based\non the same method with N-nitrosamine formation measurements.28 The pKa of MOR (8.56)\nis much lower than those for the other four secondary amines (10.54–11.12).\nTherefore, at pH 7, the concentration of the neutral MOR is 2–3\norders of magnitude higher than those for the other four secondary\namines, which in turn accelerates the reaction between the secondary\namine and reactive nitrosating agents. The presence of formaldehyde\nfor the same experimental conditions significantly enhanced the formation\nkinetics by a factor of approximately 26, 29, 10, 152, and 5 for NDMA,\nNMEA, NDEA, NPYR, and NMOR, respectively (Figure 1f). To this end, the role of formaldehyde\nin enhancing the nitrosation of amines warrants further investigations,\nwhich are presented in the following sections. Nitrosation\nof selected secondary amines in the presence of nitrite.\n(a) N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), (b) N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA), (c) N-nitrosodiethylamine\n(NDEA), (d) N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), and (e) N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) formation kinetics in the absence\n(red) and presence (blue) of formaldehyde. (f) Summary of the observed N-nitrosamine formation rates in the absence and presence\nof formaldehyde. The error bars are standard deviations from triplicate\nexperiments. Experimental conditions: [secondary amine]0 = [formaldehyde]0 = 10 mM, [NO2–]0 = 50 mM, pH = 7, phosphate buffer = 0.1 M. To elucidate\nthe role of formaldehyde in the enhancement of a nitrosation\nprocess, the reactions between secondary amines and formaldehyde were\ninvestigated. First, quantum chemical computations were conducted\nto elucidate the role of formaldehyde and methanediol in the reactions\nwith secondary amines due to coexistence of these two species in aqueous\nsolution.42 As shown in Figure S16, the computed free energy profiles for the reactions\nof methanediol with secondary amines are extremely high (e.g., 48.6\nkcal mol–1 for DMA), while they are relatively low\nfor formaldehyde (e.g., 8.7 kcal mol–1 for DMA)\nand can be considered as thermodynamically favorable. This suggests\nthat the reactions of methanediol with secondary amines proceed via\na two-step pathway (methanediol dehydrates to formaldehyde first,\nwhich then reacts with secondary amines). Then, equilibrium constants\nfor the reactions of formaldehyde with the selected secondary amines\nwere determined by titration of amines with a formaldehyde solution\n(Figures S1–S5) and are provided\nin Table 1. The results\ncan be divided into two groups with different characteristics for K1 and K2 (Scheme 1c). For group I (MEA\nand DEA), only K1 can be determined because K2 was too low to be estimated, while for group\nII (DMA, PYR, MOR) both K1 and K2 can be obtained. K1 values were determined to be 195, 30, 757, 347, and 826 M–1, for MEA, DEA, DMA, PYR, and MOR, respectively. The K1 of DMA is much higher than for MEA and DEA, which can\nbe attributed to the stronger steric hindrance for the addition of\nformaldehyde to the latter secondary amines.33K2 in group II for the equilibrium between\nprotonated secondary amines and formaldehyde was between 1.0 and 1.2\nM–1, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower\nthan K1. Based on these equilibrium constants\nand predicted pKa values (Table 1),52 the distribution of each species in equilibrium for the reactions\nof secondary amines with formaldehyde at pH 4–8 can be estimated.\nThis is shown in Figure S7 and Table S2. The concentration of neutral carbinolamines is significantly higher\nthan the neutral secondary amines (by a factor of 2 to 10), which\nmay be important for N-nitrosamine formation by the\ncarbinolamine pathway. Equilibrium constants (K1 and K2) according to Scheme 1c. The K2 values\nfor methylethylamine and\ndiethylamine were too low to be\ndetermined. Predicted by\nChemicalize software.52 The K1 of\ndimethylamine and pyrrolidine is lower than previously reported\nvalues, deviation is in the range found among studies from different\nlaboratories. The difference may be due to the different ionic strengths\nused in this study (25 mM), compared to that in the previous study\n(25–75 mM).33 The pH significantly affects the speciation of\nreactive nitrosating species (N2O3/NO2–) and the equilibrium concentrations of secondary\namines and intermediates (carbinolamines and iminium ions). For instance,\nthe reactions of secondary amines and carbinolamines with N2O3 are unfavorable at high pH due to extremely low concentrations\nof N2O3 (1.5 × 10–15 M–1 at pH 8 compared to 1.5 × 10–9 M–1 at pH 4 for 50 mM nitrite, Table S3). These are ideal conditions for the elucidation\nof the iminium ion pathway. In contrast, at a low pH, the contributions\nof secondary amines and carbinolamines to N-nitrosamine\nformation will outcompete the iminium ion pathway. Therefore, the\nenhancement of N-nitrosamine formation kinetics and\nmechanisms can be assessed based on (1) the iminium ion pathway at\nhigh pH, (2) the carbinolamine pathway at low pH, (3) quantum chemical\ncomputations, and (4) kinetic simulations of NDMA formation as a function\nof pH. Figures 2a–e show a correlation between the\nobserved N-nitrosamine formation kinetics (rtotal) and the nitrite concentration ([NO2–]) at pH 8 in the presence of formaldehyde.\nGenerally, a linear increase of rtotal as a function of the [NO2–] was observed.\nThese results align well with a previously proposed mechanism that\niminium ions are dominant intermediates under basic conditions.30,37 Iminium ions undergo rapid hydrolysis in aqueous solution,32 and a direct experimental determination of the\nsecond-order rate constants for the reactions of iminium ions with\nnitrite (kiminium ion) is currently\nnot possible. However, iminium ions are in equilibrium with carbinolamines\n(K3 = [iminium]/[carbinolamine], eq S13 in Text S5). Therefore, kiminium ion × K3 values (see detailed information in Text S5) were used as alternatives to kiminium ion in kinetic evaluation and are provided in Table S4. Using this indirect approach, the contribution of the iminium\nion pathway to N-nitrosamine formation can be estimated\n(Text S8), as illustrated in Figures S8 and S9. The iminium ion pathway is\ndominant under neutral and alkaline conditions. However, for more\nacidic conditions, the enhancement in the formation kinetics of N-nitrosamine cannot be fully explained by the iminium ion\npathway (riminium ion), except for\nMOR, as shown in Figures S8 and S9. This\nindicates that other pathways (carbinolamine pathway; see next section)\nmay also be important in the nitrosation process. Nitrosation of (a–e)\nsecondary amines (pH 8) by nitrite\nand (f–i) carbinolamines (pH 4) by N2O3 in the presence of formaldehyde. Linear relationship between (a–e) rtotal and [NO2–]0 (iminium ion pathway), (f–i) rcarbinolamine and [NO2–]20 (carbinolamine pathway). Experimental conditions:\n[secondary amine]0 = [formaldehyde]0 = 10 mM,\n[NO2–]0 = 1–50 mM,\npH = 4 or 8, phosphate buffer = 0.1 M. Figures 2f−i\nshow the correlation between the observed N-nitrosamine\nformation kinetics from the carbinolamine pathway (rcarbinolamine) (by subtracting the riminium ion and rR2NH from rtotal, eq S19 in Text S7) and the square of nitrite concentrations ([NO2–]2) in the range of 1 to 5 mM at pH 4 (see detailed information\nin Text S7). The linear relationship between rcarbinolamine and [NO2–]2, which is proportional to N2O3 (Text S2, eqs S4–S6), suggests\nthat N2O3 may act as the nitrosating agent,\nsimilar to the secondary amine pathway (eq 4, Figures S11 and S12). The estimated second-order rate constants for the reactions of\ncarbinolamines with N2O3, shown in Table S4, were on the same order of magnitude\nas those for secondary amines. Meanwhile, due to the much lower pKa of carbinolamines, the estimated relative\nconcentrations of neutral carbinolamines are generally higher than\nfor neutral secondary amines (Table S2 and Figure S7), which may enhance the formation of N-nitrosamine\nunder acidic conditions. Based on the fact that N-nitrosamine formation is enhanced in the presence of formaldehyde,\ncarbinolamine seems to be a precursor at lower pH. This is supported\nby quantum chemical computations and kinetic simulations discussed\nin the next sections. Quantum chemical computations were performed to reveal embedded\npathways induced by secondary amines, iminium ions, and carbinolamines\nvia two nitrosating agents (NO2– and\nN2O3) for the formation of N-nitrosamines in the absence and presence of formaldehyde. As shown in Figure 3a, the aqueous-phase free energy\nprofiles for the reactions of neutral secondary amines with N2O3 were computed. Although a previous study showed\na one-step reaction for the formation of NDMA from the reaction of\nDMA with N2O3,48 our\ntheoretical results suggest that this pathway proceeds via two steps:\n(1) electrophilic attack of the amine nitrogen by the NO group of\nN2O3 for the formation of intermediates, R2N+H-NO + NO2–, with\nfree energies of activation between 8.5–9.4 kcal mol–1 and (2) a H-atom transfer reaction from the amine-nitrogen to the\nO-atom of NO2– with free energies of\nactivation between 3.3–10.3 kcal mol–1. When\nsecondary amines are in their protonated forms, the free energies\nof activation of the first step are significantly higher in the range\nof 39.1–42.1 kcal mol–1 (Figure S13), making this species practically unreactive, in\nagreement with a previous report.28 Calculated\nminimum energy pathway of nitrosation process from reactions\nof (a) secondary amine, (b) iminium ion, and (c) carbinolamine with\nthe corresponding nitrosating agents and (d) carbinolamine formation\nfrom the reaction of dimethylamine (DMA) with formaldehyde (R represents\nalkyl groups attached to nitrogen). The reactions of iminium ions with\nnitrite were found to proceed via a three-step pathway, as shown in Figure 3b: (1) electrophilic\nattack at the unsaturated carbon of iminium ions by the O-atom of\nNO2– for the formation of an intermediate,\nR2NCH2–ONO, with free energies of activation\nbetween 11.6–17.8 kcal mol–1; (2) O-atom\ntransfer from the ONO to the C-atom for the formation of R2N(NO)–CH2O with lower free energies of activation\nbetween −2.0–6.3 kcal mol–1; and (3)\nleaving of formaldehyde from the intermediate and formation of the\ncorresponding N-nitrosamine with negative free energies\nof activation. Iminium ions can undergo fast hydrolysis to generate\ncarbinolamines and are in equilibrium with them in water (Scheme 1c).32 Although this process is reversible and exergonic, significantly\nhigher free energies of activation (e.g., up to 37.9 kcal mol–1 for DMA, Figure S14) resulted\nin a slow conversion rate from carbinolamine back to the corresponding\niminium ion. This is in good agreement with the low concentrations\nof iminium ions in aqueous solution.32 The reactions between carbinolamines\nand N2O3 also proceed through a two-step process.\nThe free energies of activation for the first step of an electrophilic\nattack at the amine-N by NO of N2O3 generating\nintermediates R2N+(CH2OH)–NO\nare in the range of 3.4–10.5 kcal mol–1 (Figure 3c), comparable to\nthose of secondary amines. These results are also in accordance with\nthe similar second-order rate constants determined for the reactions\nof secondary amines and carbinolamines with N2O3. Significantly larger free energies of activation for the reaction\nof carbinolamines with NO2– (approximately\n55 kcal mol–1, Figure S15) further support that NO2– does not\ncontribute to the enhanced formation of N-nitrosamines\nunder acidic conditions. The intermediates undergo simultaneous cleavage\nof a C–H bond and structural arrangement to form N-nitrosamines, formaldehyde, and HNO2 (Figure 3c) with free energies of activation\nranging from 10 to 13.5 kcal mol–1. For the formation\nof carbinolamines from the reaction of neutral secondary amines with\nformaldehyde, computed free energies of activation range from 8.7\nto 11.2 kcal mol–1 (Figure S16), indicating little enhancement of carbinolamines formation. However,\nby addition of 1–3 explicit water molecules to account for\nexplicit hydrogen bonds representing the hydration of formaldehyde,\nthe free energies of activation for the reaction with DMA are reduced\nto 6.3 kcal mol–1 (one H2O molecule)\nand 1.5 kcal mol–1 (three H2O molecules)\ncompared to 8.7 kcal mol–1 without H2O molecules, supporting the significant enhancement of NDMA formation\nby including explicit hydrogen bond(s) in a hydration process (Figure 3d). Based on the\nrate constants for the reactions of secondary amines and carbinolamines\nwith N2O3 (at pH 4) and iminium ions with nitrite\n(at pH 8) obtained in this study (Table S4), a kinetic simulation of NDMA formation in the presence of formaldehyde\nwas performed in a wider range of pH (from 4 to 8) and nitrite concentrations\n(from 1 to 50 mM) with the Kintecus software (Table S1).43 In addition, the reaction\nof DMA with formaldehyde for the production of carbinolamine was considered\nin the simulation procedure to obtain a better prediction.44Figure S17 shows\nthat the predicted rtotal fitted well\nwith the experimental results at all of the nitrite concentrations\nand pH values tested. The carbinolamine pathway was found to dominate\nNDMA formation under acidic conditions, while the iminium ion pathway\nwas the key contributor under neutral and alkaline conditions in kinetic\nsimulation, which also agrees with the experimental observations in\nthe previous sections. At pH 4, we also observed a slower increase\nof rcarbinolamine as a function of [NO2–]2 at higher\nnitrite concentrations (5–50 mM), both in the simulated and\nexperimental results (Figure S18a), which\nis contrary to the linear tendency at lower nitrite concentrations\n(<5 mM, Figure 2). To address this issue, the evolution of carbinolamine during nitrosation\nat pH 4–8 was simulated with high nitrite concentrations (50\nmM) to elucidate the possible mechanism. As shown in Figure S19a, the simulated carbinolamine concentrations at\npH 4 in the absence of nitrite are 4.9-fold higher than those in the\npresence of nitrite. The reaction of DMA with formaldehyde was reported\nto be relatively fast (k = 5.6 × 103 M–1 s–1) and usually complete\nwithin seconds.44 Therefore, the lower\nsimulated carbinolamine concentrations at the lower pH indicate a\nfaster depletion by reaction with N2O3 under\nacidic conditions. This effect is enhanced by an increased N2O3 concentration (carbinolamine consumer) by a factor\nof ∼108, from 1.5 × 10–15 to 1.2 × 10–7 M when the pH decreased from\n8 to 4 (Table S3). In addition to formaldehyde, other\ncarbonyl compounds are also detected in engineered aquatic systems.17,53−58 For instance, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone account for\nabout 90% of the total carbonyl compounds detected in water reuse\nsystems employing ozonation, with formaldehyde being the dominant\nspecies.17 Their concentrations range from\n<20 μg/L in drinking water17 to\nhundreds of mg/L in industrial effluent.16 As shown in Figure 4, compared to formaldehyde, only acetaldehyde showed a slight enhancement\neffect on N-nitrosamine formation. Benzaldehyde and\nacetone did not have an effect on the nitrosation reaction of the\nselected secondary amines, consistent with previous results.30 As discussed in the previous sections, iminium\nions are the key intermediates that promote N-nitrosamine\nformation under neutral pH conditions. Two reasons may explain the\ndifferent catalytic activities among the different carbonyl compounds.\nFirst, among the tested carbonyls, formaldehyde is the strongest electrophile\nwith small steric hindrances, which may result in higher concentrations\nof carbinolamines and iminium ions. This, in turn, may enhance the N-nitrosamine formation. Second, the reactivity of iminium\nions with nitrite is determined by their electrophilicities.59 An empirical structure–reactivity relationship\n(Text S5 and Table S5) suggests that the\nsecond-order rate constant for the reaction of the formaldehyde-derived\niminium ion with nitrite is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan that for benzaldehyde. Although such a semiquantitative method\nis typically applied in organic solvents and has some uncertainties\n(1–2 orders of magnitude), this assessment can still partially\nexplain the difference in the enhancement effects of different carbonyl\ncompounds.60 For the reactions of DMA with\nother carbonyl compounds such as acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and acetone\nfor the formation of NDMA, the computed free energies of activation\nare 16.7, 19.7, and 47 kcal mol–1, respectively\n(Figure S20). These activation energies\nare significantly higher compared with the reaction with formaldehyde\n(8.7 kcal mol–1), which is consistent with the experimental\nobservations presented in Figure 4. Future efforts to further elucidate the effects of\nfunctional groups on carbonyl compounds (steric hindrance and electronic\nproperties) on N-nitrosamine formation will help\nto better understand the underlying mechanisms. Effect of various carbonyl\ncompounds on the rates of N-nitrosamine formation\nfrom nitrosation of secondary amines in ultrapurified\nwater. Experimental conditions: [secondary amine]0 = [carbonyl\ncompounds]0 = 10 mM, [NO2–]0 = 50 mM, pH = 7, and phosphate buffer = 0.1 M. The results\nfrom this study\ndemonstrate the catalytic roles of carbonyl compounds in the conversion\nof amine precursors to N-nitrosamines via the iminium\nion and carbinolamine pathways. Carbonyl compounds may be present\nin aquatic systems from incomplete removal in water treatment processes\n(at low levels),34,61 industrial discharges (at medium\nlevels),62 and industrial production processes\n(e.g., Petasis reaction, using amines and carbonyl compounds at high\nlevels as substrates for the production of amino acids).63 Kinetic modeling was performed to evaluate the\nspecific potential for NDMA formation in these scenarios (Text S10). In typical water treatment processes\n(Scenario 1), the presence of trace amounts of formaldehyde (5 μM)\nmay lead to a 104-fold higher NDMA formation (Table S8), in which iminium ion acts as the key\nactive intermediate for enhancement (Figure S21). However, the potential for NDMA formation (<0.1 ng/L) will\nstill be far below any regulatory threshold (e.g., 100 ng/L in WHO\nguidelines) for NDMA due to insufficient precursor concentrations\nfor nitrosation reaction.10 When the concentrations\nof these precursors increase to medium levels in industrial discharges\n(Scenario 2), the presence of formaldehyde results in NDMA formation\npotentials in the μg/L level range (Table S9) exceeding the WHO guidelines for all simulated conditions.\nIn this scenario, the iminium ion is the key promoter at high pH and\ncarbinolamine also participates in the NDMA formation at low pH (Figure S22). The worst scenario can be assumed\nfor industrial production processes (Scenario 3). High DMA concentrations\n(0.1 M) may be used in synthetic processes, and traces of nitrite\nwere modeled to produce negligible quantities of NDMA (<0.01 ng/L, Table S10). However, when formaldehyde is copresent\nas a reagent (Scenario 3-2 in Table S10), the potential for NDMA formation may exceed thousands of nanograms\nper liter, where the iminium ion is supposed to be the main driver\nfor the enhanced nitrosation reaction (Figure S24). Meanwhile, when nitrite is used as a reagent (Scenario\n3-3 in Table S10), trace quantities of\nDMA and formaldehyde may also lead to high concentrations of NDMA\n(>1.2 × 105 ng/L), catalyzed by both the carbinolamine\nand iminium ion pathways (Figure S25).\nA recent survey on industrial discharges in Switzerland also detected\nlarger concentrations of N-nitrosamines from chemical/pharmaceutical\nsynthesis processes, which is in agreement with the modeled results\nin the current study.22 Overall, the highest\nrisk of N-nitrosamine formation can be attributed\nto industrial wastewaters, and mitigation strategies should be implemented\nat this source. Aldehydes/nitrite are common components in some\nengineered systems impacted by industrial activities. For instance,\nbronopol, an antifouling agent in industrial cooling or hydraulic\nfracturing processes, may degrade into formaldehyde and nitrite and\ncontribute to N-nitrosamine formation when mixed\nwith water containing secondary amines.23,24 In amine-based\nCO2 capture systems, flue gas containing high concentrations\nof nitrite and aldehydes can also pose a risk for unintended formation\nof N-nitrosamines.25 Considering\nthe coexistence of numerous other amines and carbonyl compounds in\naqueous solutions, the total N-nitrosamine formation\nmight exceed the predicted levels reported in this study."

The observed rates\nof N-nitrosamine formation (rtotal) in the absence of formaldehyde are low for all secondary\namines, except for MOR (Figure 1e). The formation kinetics decreased in the following order:\nNMOR (0.17 μM min–1) ≫ NDMA (3.09 ×\n10–3 μM min–1) > NMEA\n(6.41\n× 10–4 μM min–1) >\nNPYR (3.69 × 10–4 μM min–1) > NDEA (1.62 × 10–4 μM min–1). In the presence of nitrite, nitrosation of secondary\namine occurs\nmainly through N2O3 (1.5 × 10–13 M in equilibrium with NO2–, eqs S4–S6 in Text S2) by a nucleophilic\nattack.34 Second-order rate constants for\nthe reactions of N2O3 with the selected secondary\namines were determined in this study (Text S6 and Figures S11 and 12) to be in the range of 2.3 × 107 to 2.1 × 108 M–1 s–1 (Table S4). This is comparable\nto previously reported values within a factor of 1.3 to 3.8 based\non the same method with N-nitrosamine formation measurements.28 The pKa of MOR (8.56)\nis much lower than those for the other four secondary amines (10.54–11.12).\nTherefore, at pH 7, the concentration of the neutral MOR is 2–3\norders of magnitude higher than those for the other four secondary\namines, which in turn accelerates the reaction between the secondary\namine and reactive nitrosating agents.

      "text": "To elucidate\nthe role of formaldehyde in the enhancement of a nitrosation\nprocess, the reactions between secondary amines and formaldehyde were\ninvestigated. First, quantum chemical computations were conducted\nto elucidate the role of formaldehyde and methanediol in the reactions\nwith secondary amines due to coexistence of these two species in aqueous\nsolution.42 As shown in Figure S16, the computed free energy profiles for the reactions\nof methanediol with secondary amines are extremely high (e.g., 48.6\nkcal mol–1 for DMA), while they are relatively low\nfor formaldehyde (e.g., 8.7 kcal mol–1 for DMA)\nand can be considered as thermodynamically favorable. This suggests\nthat the reactions of methanediol with secondary amines proceed via\na two-step pathway (methanediol dehydrates to formaldehyde first,\nwhich then reacts with secondary amines). Then, equilibrium constants\nfor the reactions of formaldehyde with the selected secondary amines\nwere determined by titration of amines with a formaldehyde solution\n(Figures S1–S5) and are provided\nin Table 1. The results\ncan be divided into two groups with different characteristics for K1 and K2 (Scheme 1c). For group I (MEA\nand DEA), only K1 can be determined because K2 was too low to be estimated, while for group\nII (DMA, PYR, MOR) both K1 and K2 can be obtained. K1 values were determined to be 195, 30, 757, 347, and 826 M–1, for MEA, DEA, DMA, PYR, and MOR, respectively. The K1 of DMA is much higher than for MEA and DEA, which can\nbe attributed to the stronger steric hindrance for the addition of\nformaldehyde to the latter secondary amines.33K2 in group II for the equilibrium between\nprotonated secondary amines and formaldehyde was between 1.0 and 1.2\nM–1, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower\nthan K1. Based on these equilibrium constants\nand predicted pKa values (Table 1),52 the distribution of each species in equilibrium for the reactions\nof secondary amines with formaldehyde at pH 4–8 can be estimated.\nThis is shown in Figure S7 and Table S2.

For instance,\nthe reactions of secondary amines and carbinolamines with N2O3 are unfavorable at high pH due to extremely low concentrations\nof N2O3 (1.5 × 10–15 M–1 at pH 8 compared to 1.5 × 10–9 M–1 at pH 4 for 50 mM nitrite, Table S3). These are ideal conditions for the elucidation\nof the iminium ion pathway.

As shown in Figure 3a, the aqueous-phase free energy\nprofiles for the reactions of neutral secondary amines with N2O3 were computed. Although a previous study showed\na one-step reaction for the formation of NDMA from the reaction of\nDMA with N2O3,48 our\ntheoretical results suggest that this pathway proceeds via two steps:\n(1) electrophilic attack of the amine nitrogen by the NO group of\nN2O3 for the formation of intermediates, R2N+H-NO + NO2–, with\nfree energies of activation between 8.5–9.4 kcal mol–1 and (2) a H-atom transfer reaction from the amine-nitrogen to the\nO-atom of NO2– with free energies of\nactivation between 3.3–10.3 kcal mol–1. When\nsecondary amines are in their protonated forms, the free energies\nof activation of the first step are significantly higher in the range\nof 39.1–42.1 kcal mol–1 (Figure S13), making this species practically unreactive, in\nagreement with a previous report.28 Calculated\nminimum energy pathway of nitrosation process from reactions\nof (a) secondary amine, (b) iminium ion, and (c) carbinolamine with\nthe corresponding nitrosating agents and (d) carbinolamine formation\nfrom the reaction of dimethylamine (DMA) with formaldehyde (R represents\nalkyl groups attached to nitrogen). The reactions of iminium ions with\nnitrite were found to proceed via a three-step pathway, as shown in Figure 3b: (1) electrophilic\nattack at the unsaturated carbon of iminium ions by the O-atom of\nNO2– for the formation of an intermediate,\nR2NCH2–ONO, with free energies of activation\nbetween 11.6–17.8 kcal mol–1; (2) O-atom\ntransfer from the ONO to the C-atom for the formation of R2N(NO)–CH2O with lower free energies of activation\nbetween −2.0–6.3 kcal mol–1; and (3)\nleaving of formaldehyde from the intermediate and formation of the\ncorresponding N-nitrosamine with negative free energies\nof activation.

Benzaldehyde and\nacetone did not have an effect on the nitrosation reaction of the\nselected secondary amines, consistent with previous results.30 As discussed in the previous sections, iminium\nions are the key intermediates that promote N-nitrosamine\nformation under neutral pH conditions. Two reasons may explain the\ndifferent catalytic activities among the different carbonyl compounds.\nFirst, among the tested carbonyls, formaldehyde is the strongest electrophile\nwith small steric hindrances, which may result in higher concentrations\nof carbinolamines and iminium ions. This, in turn, may enhance the N-nitrosamine formation. Second, the reactivity of iminium\nions with nitrite is determined by their electrophilicities.59 An empirical structure–reactivity relationship\n(Text S5 and Table S5) suggests that the\nsecond-order rate constant for the reaction of the formaldehyde-derived\niminium ion with nitrite is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan that for benzaldehyde.

      "text": "The results\nfrom this study\ndemonstrate the catalytic roles of carbonyl compounds in the conversion\nof amine precursors to N-nitrosamines via the iminium\nion and carbinolamine pathways. Carbonyl compounds may be present\nin aquatic systems from incomplete removal in water treatment processes\n(at low levels),34,61 industrial discharges (at medium\nlevels),62 and industrial production processes\n(e.g., Petasis reaction, using amines and carbonyl compounds at high\nlevels as substrates for the production of amino acids).63 Kinetic modeling was performed to evaluate the\nspecific potential for NDMA formation in these scenarios (Text S10). In typical water treatment processes\n(Scenario 1), the presence of trace amounts of formaldehyde (5 μM)\nmay lead to a 104-fold higher NDMA formation (Table S8), in which iminium ion acts as the key\nactive intermediate for enhancement (Figure S21). However, the potential for NDMA formation (<0.1 ng/L) will\nstill be far below any regulatory threshold (e.g., 100 ng/L in WHO\nguidelines) for NDMA due to insufficient precursor concentrations\nfor nitrosation reaction.10 When the concentrations\nof these precursors increase to medium levels in industrial discharges\n(Scenario 2), the presence of formaldehyde results in NDMA formation\npotentials in the μg/L level range (Table S9) exceeding the WHO guidelines for all simulated conditions.\nIn this scenario, the iminium ion is the key promoter at high pH and\ncarbinolamine also participates in the NDMA formation at low pH (Figure S22). The worst scenario can be assumed\nfor industrial production processes (Scenario 3). High DMA concentrations\n(0.1 M) may be used in synthetic processes, and traces of nitrite\nwere modeled to produce negligible quantities of NDMA (<0.01 ng/L, Table S10). However, when formaldehyde is copresent\nas a reagent (Scenario 3-2 in Table S10), the potential for NDMA formation may exceed thousands of nanograms\nper liter, where the iminium ion is supposed to be the main driver\nfor the enhanced nitrosation reaction (Figure S24). Meanwhile, when nitrite is used as a reagent (Scenario\n3-3 in Table S10), trace quantities of\nDMA and formaldehyde may also lead to high concentrations of NDMA\n(>1.2 × 105 ng/L), catalyzed by both the carbinolamine\nand iminium ion pathways (Figure S25).\nA recent survey on industrial discharges in Switzerland also detected\nlarger concentrations of N-nitrosamines from chemical/pharmaceutical\nsynthesis processes, which is in agreement with the modeled results\nin the current study.22 Overall, the highest\nrisk of N-nitrosamine formation can be attributed\nto industrial wastewaters, and mitigation strategies should be implemented\nat this source. Aldehydes/nitrite are common components in some\nengineered systems impacted by industrial activities. For instance,\nbronopol, an antifouling agent in industrial cooling or hydraulic\nfracturing processes, may degrade into formaldehyde and nitrite and\ncontribute to N-nitrosamine formation when mixed\nwith water containing secondary amines.23,24 In amine-based\nCO2 capture systems, flue gas containing high concentrations\nof nitrite and aldehydes can also pose a risk for unintended formation\nof N-nitrosamines.25 Considering\nthe coexistence of numerous other amines and carbonyl compounds in\naqueous solutions, the total N-nitrosamine formation\nmight exceed the predicted levels reported in this study."

A notification level of 10 ng/L\nwas set for 3 N-nitrosamines by California’s\nDepartment of Public Health (CDPH).12 Even though in water treatment, oxidation processes and especially\nchloramination are the main drivers for N-nitrosamine\nformation,2,13 nitrosation processes may become an important\npathway when secondary amines, nitrite, and carbonyl compounds are\npresent simultaneously in engineered aquatic systems (e.g., in sewer\nsystems or wastewater treatment plants where municipal and industrial\nwastewaters are mixed).14,15 They are common wastewater\ncomponents and their concentrations can reach up to tens of mg/L.16−21 One case in point, which may be a consequence of the reactions of\nthese compounds, is a survey on N-nitrosamines in\nindustrial wastewaters in Switzerland, in which N-nitrosamine concentrations of almost 1 mg/L were detected.22 Nitrosation reactions can also occur in water\nsystems receiving effluents from industrial cooling or hydraulic fracturing\nprocesses,23,24 amine-based CO2 capture\nsystems,25 food processing26 and GAC-based methods for N-nitrosamine\nanalysis.27 Nitrite itself is a weak nitrosating\nagent, however, it enhances N-nitrosamine formation\nat low pH (<6) by production of strong nitrosating agents such\nas dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) and nitrosyl halides\n(XNO, X = Cl–/Br–) (eqs 1–3).28 The corresponding second-order rate\nconstants for the reactions with secondary amines are in the order\nof 106–109 M–1 s–1 (eqs 4, 5 and Scheme 1a).2912345 N-Nitrosamine\nformation in (a) the absence28 and (b)\nthe presence30 of carbonyl compounds. (c)\nEquilibria for the reactions between secondary amines and carbonyl\ncompounds,33 and (d) N-nitrosamine formation from simple tertiary amines.34 The nitrosation process is most\nfavorable under acidic conditions\n(Scheme 1a). Nevertheless,\nunder neutral and basic conditions, an alternative pathway for N-nitrosamine formation proceeds via formaldehyde and chloral\ncatalysts (Scheme 1b).30 The proposed N-nitrosamine\nformation mechanism in the presence of carbonyl compounds includes\nan initial reaction between secondary amines and carbonyl compounds\n(Scheme 1c).31 This reaction yields a carbinolamine, which\neasily releases a hydroxyl group to yield an iminium ion. Iminium\nions are known to have high reactivity with nucleophiles such as nitrite,\nwhich yields N-nitrosamines and the parent carbonyl\ncompounds (Scheme 1b).30 However, iminium ions are unstable\nand hydrolyze rapidly in aqueous solutions. One case in point is H2C = N+(CH3)CH2CF3, an aliphatic iminium ion which has a hydrolysis rate constant of\n(1.8 ± 0.1) × 107 s–1 and a\nlifetime of (5.5 ± 0.3) × 10–8 s.32 Therefore, the transient concentrations of iminium\nions in aqueous solutions are extremely low and may not be relevant\nto the formation of significant concentrations of N-nitrosamine in aquatic systems. Carbinolamines, the precursors\nof iminium ions, are always in equilibrium\nwith secondary amines and iminium ions in aqueous solution (Scheme 1c). They are tertiary\namine-type compounds and may also be involved in the nitrosation process\nwith formation of the corresponding N-nitrosamines.35,36 Previous studies suggest that tertiary amines may first undergo\na dealkylation process to yield a secondary amine, which can then\nbe nitrosated to N-nitrosamine (Scheme 1d).34 In their neutral form, tertiary amines also have a lone electron\npair on the amine nitrogen, which may attack N2O3, similar to the case of secondary amines. Meanwhile, the dissociation\nconstant (Ka) of carbinolamines was reported\nto be 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the parent\nsecondary amines.33 This means that a higher\nfraction of carbinolamine is in its neutral form at the same pH value,\nwhich can contribute to the formation of the corresponding N-nitrosamine. To assess the extent of nitrosation reactions\nin the presence of carbonyl compounds, kinetic and mechanistic information\nabout N-nitrosamine formation is needed. This\nstudy investigated the N-nitrosamine formation\nby nitrosation in nitrite- and carbonyl compound-containing solutions.\nThe objectives of this study were (1) to elucidate the formation kinetics\nof N-nitrosamines from secondary amines in the pH-range\n4–8 and (2) to investigate the mechanisms of N-nitrosamine formation including different potential precursors such\nas secondary amines, carbinolamines, and iminium ions. In addition,\nquantum chemical computations and kinetic simulations were performed\nto support the proposed mechanism, allowing a comprehensive understanding\nof the fate of different reactive species during nitrosation. Finally,\nnitrosation processes were assessed for different water qualities\nby kinetic modeling.\n\n## Materials and Methods\nDimethylamine (DMA), diethylamine\n(DEA), sulfamic acid, formaldehyde (HCHO, 37 wt % in H2O containing 10–15% methanol as a stabilizer), acetone, and\nbenzaldehyde were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, pyrrolidine (PYR),\nmorpholine (MOR), sodium nitrite, and acetaldehyde from Merck, and N-methylethylamine (MEA) from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI)\nCo., Ltd.

All experiments\nwere conducted at least in duplicates. A\ntitration method was used to fit the K values for\nthe reactions of secondary amines with formaldehyde (Text S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)).33,41,42 Briefly, 10 μL aliquots\nof a formaldehyde solution (13.4 M) were added to 10 mL of a secondary\namine solution (5 mM) with a micropipette, and pH changes were recorded.\nBased on this, the K value can be determined by plotting\nΔpH as a function of [HCHO]total (Figures S1–S5, Supporting Information). It should be\nnoted that the determined K values are apparent equilibrium\nconstants that take both formaldehyde and its hydrated form (methanediol)\ninto account.

The observed rates\nof N-nitrosamine formation (rtotal) in the absence of formaldehyde are low for all secondary\namines, except for MOR (Figure 1e). The formation kinetics decreased in the following order:\nNMOR (0.17 μM min–1) ≫ NDMA (3.09 ×\n10–3 μM min–1) > NMEA\n(6.41\n× 10–4 μM min–1) >\nNPYR (3.69 × 10–4 μM min–1) > NDEA (1.62 × 10–4 μM min–1). In the presence of nitrite, nitrosation of secondary\namine occurs\nmainly through N2O3 (1.5 × 10–13 M in equilibrium with NO2–, eqs S4–S6 in Text S2) by a nucleophilic\nattack.34 Second-order rate constants for\nthe reactions of N2O3 with the selected secondary\namines were determined in this study (Text S6 and Figures S11 and 12) to be in the range of 2.3 × 107 to 2.1 × 108 M–1 s–1 (Table S4). This is comparable\nto previously reported values within a factor of 1.3 to 3.8 based\non the same method with N-nitrosamine formation measurements.28 The pKa of MOR (8.56)\nis much lower than those for the other four secondary amines (10.54–11.12).\nTherefore, at pH 7, the concentration of the neutral MOR is 2–3\norders of magnitude higher than those for the other four secondary\namines, which in turn accelerates the reaction between the secondary\namine and reactive nitrosating agents. The presence of formaldehyde\nfor the same experimental conditions significantly enhanced the formation\nkinetics by a factor of approximately 26, 29, 10, 152, and 5 for NDMA,\nNMEA, NDEA, NPYR, and NMOR, respectively (Figure 1f). To this end, the role of formaldehyde\nin enhancing the nitrosation of amines warrants further investigations,\nwhich are presented in the following sections.

Experimental conditions: [secondary amine]0 = [formaldehyde]0 = 10 mM, [NO2–]0 = 50 mM, pH = 7, phosphate buffer = 0.1 M. To elucidate\nthe role of formaldehyde in the enhancement of a nitrosation\nprocess, the reactions between secondary amines and formaldehyde were\ninvestigated. First, quantum chemical computations were conducted\nto elucidate the role of formaldehyde and methanediol in the reactions\nwith secondary amines due to coexistence of these two species in aqueous\nsolution.42 As shown in Figure S16, the computed free energy profiles for the reactions\nof methanediol with secondary amines are extremely high (e.g., 48.6\nkcal mol–1 for DMA), while they are relatively low\nfor formaldehyde (e.g., 8.7 kcal mol–1 for DMA)\nand can be considered as thermodynamically favorable. This suggests\nthat the reactions of methanediol with secondary amines proceed via\na two-step pathway (methanediol dehydrates to formaldehyde first,\nwhich then reacts with secondary amines). Then, equilibrium constants\nfor the reactions of formaldehyde with the selected secondary amines\nwere determined by titration of amines with a formaldehyde solution\n(Figures S1–S5) and are provided\nin Table 1. The results\ncan be divided into two groups with different characteristics for K1 and K2 (Scheme 1c). For group I (MEA\nand DEA), only K1 can be determined because K2 was too low to be estimated, while for group\nII (DMA, PYR, MOR) both K1 and K2 can be obtained. K1 values were determined to be 195, 30, 757, 347, and 826 M–1, for MEA, DEA, DMA, PYR, and MOR, respectively. The K1 of DMA is much higher than for MEA and DEA, which can\nbe attributed to the stronger steric hindrance for the addition of\nformaldehyde to the latter secondary amines.33K2 in group II for the equilibrium between\nprotonated secondary amines and formaldehyde was between 1.0 and 1.2\nM–1, which is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower\nthan K1. Based on these equilibrium constants\nand predicted pKa values (Table 1),52 the distribution of each species in equilibrium for the reactions\nof secondary amines with formaldehyde at pH 4–8 can be estimated.\nThis is shown in Figure S7 and Table S2. The concentration of neutral carbinolamines is significantly higher\nthan the neutral secondary amines (by a factor of 2 to 10), which\nmay be important for N-nitrosamine formation by the\ncarbinolamine pathway. Equilibrium constants (K1 and K2) according to Scheme 1c. The K2 values\nfor methylethylamine and\ndiethylamine were too low to be\ndetermined. Predicted by\nChemicalize software.52 The K1 of\ndimethylamine and pyrrolidine is lower than previously reported\nvalues, deviation is in the range found among studies from different\nlaboratories. The difference may be due to the different ionic strengths\nused in this study (25 mM), compared to that in the previous study\n(25–75 mM).33 The pH significantly affects the speciation of\nreactive nitrosating species (N2O3/NO2–) and the equilibrium concentrations of secondary\namines and intermediates (carbinolamines and iminium ions). For instance,\nthe reactions of secondary amines and carbinolamines with N2O3 are unfavorable at high pH due to extremely low concentrations\nof N2O3 (1.5 × 10–15 M–1 at pH 8 compared to 1.5 × 10–9 M–1 at pH 4 for 50 mM nitrite, Table S3). These are ideal conditions for the elucidation\nof the iminium ion pathway. In contrast, at a low pH, the contributions\nof secondary amines and carbinolamines to N-nitrosamine\nformation will outcompete the iminium ion pathway. Therefore, the\nenhancement of N-nitrosamine formation kinetics and\nmechanisms can be assessed based on (1) the iminium ion pathway at\nhigh pH, (2) the carbinolamine pathway at low pH, (3) quantum chemical\ncomputations, and (4) kinetic simulations of NDMA formation as a function\nof pH. Figures 2a–e show a correlation between the\nobserved N-nitrosamine formation kinetics (rtotal) and the nitrite concentration ([NO2–]) at pH 8 in the presence of formaldehyde.\nGenerally, a linear increase of rtotal as a function of the [NO2–] was observed.\nThese results align well with a previously proposed mechanism that\niminium ions are dominant intermediates under basic conditions.30,37 Iminium ions undergo rapid hydrolysis in aqueous solution,32 and a direct experimental determination of the\nsecond-order rate constants for the reactions of iminium ions with\nnitrite (kiminium ion) is currently\nnot possible. However, iminium ions are in equilibrium with carbinolamines\n(K3 = [iminium]/[carbinolamine], eq S13 in Text S5). Therefore, kiminium ion × K3 values (see detailed information in Text S5) were used as alternatives to kiminium ion in kinetic evaluation and are provided in Table S4. Using this indirect approach, the contribution of the iminium\nion pathway to N-nitrosamine formation can be estimated\n(Text S8), as illustrated in Figures S8 and S9. The iminium ion pathway is\ndominant under neutral and alkaline conditions. However, for more\nacidic conditions, the enhancement in the formation kinetics of N-nitrosamine cannot be fully explained by the iminium ion\npathway (riminium ion), except for\nMOR, as shown in Figures S8 and S9. This\nindicates that other pathways (carbinolamine pathway; see next section)\nmay also be important in the nitrosation process. Nitrosation of (a–e)\nsecondary amines (pH 8) by nitrite\nand (f–i) carbinolamines (pH 4) by N2O3 in the presence of formaldehyde. Linear relationship between (a–e) rtotal and [NO2–]0 (iminium ion pathway), (f–i) rcarbinolamine and [NO2–]20 (carbinolamine pathway). Experimental conditions:\n[secondary amine]0 = [formaldehyde]0 = 10 mM,\n[NO2–]0 = 1–50 mM,\npH = 4 or 8, phosphate buffer = 0.1 M. Figures 2f−i\nshow the correlation between the observed N-nitrosamine\nformation kinetics from the carbinolamine pathway (rcarbinolamine) (by subtracting the riminium ion and rR2NH from rtotal, eq S19 in Text S7) and the square of nitrite concentrations ([NO2–]2) in the range of 1 to 5 mM at pH 4 (see detailed information\nin Text S7). The linear relationship between rcarbinolamine and [NO2–]2, which is proportional to N2O3 (Text S2, eqs S4–S6), suggests\nthat N2O3 may act as the nitrosating agent,\nsimilar to the secondary amine pathway (eq 4, Figures S11 and S12). The estimated second-order rate constants for the reactions of\ncarbinolamines with N2O3, shown in Table S4, were on the same order of magnitude\nas those for secondary amines. Meanwhile, due to the much lower pKa of carbinolamines, the estimated relative\nconcentrations of neutral carbinolamines are generally higher than\nfor neutral secondary amines (Table S2 and Figure S7), which may enhance the formation of N-nitrosamine\nunder acidic conditions. Based on the fact that N-nitrosamine formation is enhanced in the presence of formaldehyde,\ncarbinolamine seems to be a precursor at lower pH. This is supported\nby quantum chemical computations and kinetic simulations discussed\nin the next sections. Quantum chemical computations were performed to reveal embedded\npathways induced by secondary amines, iminium ions, and carbinolamines\nvia two nitrosating agents (NO2– and\nN2O3) for the formation of N-nitrosamines in the absence and presence of formaldehyde. As shown in Figure 3a, the aqueous-phase free energy\nprofiles for the reactions of neutral secondary amines with N2O3 were computed. Although a previous study showed\na one-step reaction for the formation of NDMA from the reaction of\nDMA with N2O3,48 our\ntheoretical results suggest that this pathway proceeds via two steps:\n(1) electrophilic attack of the amine nitrogen by the NO group of\nN2O3 for the formation of intermediates, R2N+H-NO + NO2–, with\nfree energies of activation between 8.5–9.4 kcal mol–1 and (2) a H-atom transfer reaction from the amine-nitrogen to the\nO-atom of NO2– with free energies of\nactivation between 3.3–10.3 kcal mol–1. When\nsecondary amines are in their protonated forms, the free energies\nof activation of the first step are significantly higher in the range\nof 39.1–42.1 kcal mol–1 (Figure S13), making this species practically unreactive, in\nagreement with a previous report.28 Calculated\nminimum energy pathway of nitrosation process from reactions\nof (a) secondary amine, (b) iminium ion, and (c) carbinolamine with\nthe corresponding nitrosating agents and (d) carbinolamine formation\nfrom the reaction of dimethylamine (DMA) with formaldehyde (R represents\nalkyl groups attached to nitrogen). The reactions of iminium ions with\nnitrite were found to proceed via a three-step pathway, as shown in Figure 3b: (1) electrophilic\nattack at the unsaturated carbon of iminium ions by the O-atom of\nNO2– for the formation of an intermediate,\nR2NCH2–ONO, with free energies of activation\nbetween 11.6–17.8 kcal mol–1; (2) O-atom\ntransfer from the ONO to the C-atom for the formation of R2N(NO)–CH2O with lower free energies of activation\nbetween −2.0–6.3 kcal mol–1; and (3)\nleaving of formaldehyde from the intermediate and formation of the\ncorresponding N-nitrosamine with negative free energies\nof activation. Iminium ions can undergo fast hydrolysis to generate\ncarbinolamines and are in equilibrium with them in water (Scheme 1c).32 Although this process is reversible and exergonic, significantly\nhigher free energies of activation (e.g., up to 37.9 kcal mol–1 for DMA, Figure S14) resulted\nin a slow conversion rate from carbinolamine back to the corresponding\niminium ion. This is in good agreement with the low concentrations\nof iminium ions in aqueous solution.32 The reactions between carbinolamines\nand N2O3 also proceed through a two-step process.\nThe free energies of activation for the first step of an electrophilic\nattack at the amine-N by NO of N2O3 generating\nintermediates R2N+(CH2OH)–NO\nare in the range of 3.4–10.5 kcal mol–1 (Figure 3c), comparable to\nthose of secondary amines. These results are also in accordance with\nthe similar second-order rate constants determined for the reactions\nof secondary amines and carbinolamines with N2O3. Significantly larger free energies of activation for the reaction\nof carbinolamines with NO2– (approximately\n55 kcal mol–1, Figure S15) further support that NO2– does not\ncontribute to the enhanced formation of N-nitrosamines\nunder acidic conditions. The intermediates undergo simultaneous cleavage\nof a C–H bond and structural arrangement to form N-nitrosamines, formaldehyde, and HNO2 (Figure 3c) with free energies of activation\nranging from 10 to 13.5 kcal mol–1. For the formation\nof carbinolamines from the reaction of neutral secondary amines with\nformaldehyde, computed free energies of activation range from 8.7\nto 11.2 kcal mol–1 (Figure S16), indicating little enhancement of carbinolamines formation. However,\nby addition of 1–3 explicit water molecules to account for\nexplicit hydrogen bonds representing the hydration of formaldehyde,\nthe free energies of activation for the reaction with DMA are reduced\nto 6.3 kcal mol–1 (one H2O molecule)\nand 1.5 kcal mol–1 (three H2O molecules)\ncompared to 8.7 kcal mol–1 without H2O molecules, supporting the significant enhancement of NDMA formation\nby including explicit hydrogen bond(s) in a hydration process (Figure 3d). Based on the\nrate constants for the reactions of secondary amines and carbinolamines\nwith N2O3 (at pH 4) and iminium ions with nitrite\n(at pH 8) obtained in this study (Table S4), a kinetic simulation of NDMA formation in the presence of formaldehyde\nwas performed in a wider range of pH (from 4 to 8) and nitrite concentrations\n(from 1 to 50 mM) with the Kintecus software (Table S1).43 In addition, the reaction\nof DMA with formaldehyde for the production of carbinolamine was considered\nin the simulation procedure to obtain a better prediction.44Figure S17 shows\nthat the predicted rtotal fitted well\nwith the experimental results at all of the nitrite concentrations\nand pH values tested. The carbinolamine pathway was found to dominate\nNDMA formation under acidic conditions, while the iminium ion pathway\nwas the key contributor under neutral and alkaline conditions in kinetic\nsimulation, which also agrees with the experimental observations in\nthe previous sections. At pH 4, we also observed a slower increase\nof rcarbinolamine as a function of [NO2–]2 at higher\nnitrite concentrations (5–50 mM), both in the simulated and\nexperimental results (Figure S18a), which\nis contrary to the linear tendency at lower nitrite concentrations\n(<5 mM, Figure 2). To address this issue, the evolution of carbinolamine during nitrosation\nat pH 4–8 was simulated with high nitrite concentrations (50\nmM) to elucidate the possible mechanism. As shown in Figure S19a, the simulated carbinolamine concentrations at\npH 4 in the absence of nitrite are 4.9-fold higher than those in the\npresence of nitrite. The reaction of DMA with formaldehyde was reported\nto be relatively fast (k = 5.6 × 103 M–1 s–1) and usually complete\nwithin seconds.44 Therefore, the lower\nsimulated carbinolamine concentrations at the lower pH indicate a\nfaster depletion by reaction with N2O3 under\nacidic conditions. This effect is enhanced by an increased N2O3 concentration (carbinolamine consumer) by a factor\nof ∼108, from 1.5 × 10–15 to 1.2 × 10–7 M when the pH decreased from\n8 to 4 (Table S3). In addition to formaldehyde, other\ncarbonyl compounds are also detected in engineered aquatic systems.17,53−58 For instance, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone account for\nabout 90% of the total carbonyl compounds detected in water reuse\nsystems employing ozonation, with formaldehyde being the dominant\nspecies.17 Their concentrations range from\n<20 μg/L in drinking water17 to\nhundreds of mg/L in industrial effluent.16 As shown in Figure 4, compared to formaldehyde, only acetaldehyde showed a slight enhancement\neffect on N-nitrosamine formation. Benzaldehyde and\nacetone did not have an effect on the nitrosation reaction of the\nselected secondary amines, consistent with previous results.30 As discussed in the previous sections, iminium\nions are the key intermediates that promote N-nitrosamine\nformation under neutral pH conditions. Two reasons may explain the\ndifferent catalytic activities among the different carbonyl compounds.\nFirst, among the tested carbonyls, formaldehyde is the strongest electrophile\nwith small steric hindrances, which may result in higher concentrations\nof carbinolamines and iminium ions. This, in turn, may enhance the N-nitrosamine formation. Second, the reactivity of iminium\nions with nitrite is determined by their electrophilicities.59 An empirical structure–reactivity relationship\n(Text S5 and Table S5) suggests that the\nsecond-order rate constant for the reaction of the formaldehyde-derived\niminium ion with nitrite is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan that for benzaldehyde. Although such a semiquantitative method\nis typically applied in organic solvents and has some uncertainties\n(1–2 orders of magnitude), this assessment can still partially\nexplain the difference in the enhancement effects of different carbonyl\ncompounds.60 For the reactions of DMA with\nother carbonyl compounds such as acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and acetone\nfor the formation of NDMA, the computed free energies of activation\nare 16.7, 19.7, and 47 kcal mol–1, respectively\n(Figure S20). These activation energies\nare significantly higher compared with the reaction with formaldehyde\n(8.7 kcal mol–1), which is consistent with the experimental\nobservations presented in Figure 4. Future efforts to further elucidate the effects of\nfunctional groups on carbonyl compounds (steric hindrance and electronic\nproperties) on N-nitrosamine formation will help\nto better understand the underlying mechanisms. Effect of various carbonyl\ncompounds on the rates of N-nitrosamine formation\nfrom nitrosation of secondary amines in ultrapurified\nwater. Experimental conditions: [secondary amine]0 = [carbonyl\ncompounds]0 = 10 mM, [NO2–]0 = 50 mM, pH = 7, and phosphate buffer = 0.1 M. The results\nfrom this study\ndemonstrate the catalytic roles of carbonyl compounds in the conversion\nof amine precursors to N-nitrosamines via the iminium\nion and carbinolamine pathways. Carbonyl compounds may be present\nin aquatic systems from incomplete removal in water treatment processes\n(at low levels),34,61 industrial discharges (at medium\nlevels),62 and industrial production processes\n(e.g., Petasis reaction, using amines and carbonyl compounds at high\nlevels as substrates for the production of amino acids).63 Kinetic modeling was performed to evaluate the\nspecific potential for NDMA formation in these scenarios (Text S10). In typical water treatment processes\n(Scenario 1), the presence of trace amounts of formaldehyde (5 μM)\nmay lead to a 104-fold higher NDMA formation (Table S8), in which iminium ion acts as the key\nactive intermediate for enhancement (Figure S21). However, the potential for NDMA formation (<0.1 ng/L) will\nstill be far below any regulatory threshold (e.g., 100 ng/L in WHO\nguidelines) for NDMA due to insufficient precursor concentrations\nfor nitrosation reaction.10 When the concentrations\nof these precursors increase to medium levels in industrial discharges\n(Scenario 2), the presence of formaldehyde results in NDMA formation\npotentials in the μg/L level range (Table S9) exceeding the WHO guidelines for all simulated conditions.\nIn this scenario, the iminium ion is the key promoter at high pH and\ncarbinolamine also participates in the NDMA formation at low pH (Figure S22). The worst scenario can be assumed\nfor industrial production processes (Scenario 3). High DMA concentrations\n(0.1 M) may be used in synthetic processes, and traces of nitrite\nwere modeled to produce negligible quantities of NDMA (<0.01 ng/L, Table S10). However, when formaldehyde is copresent\nas a reagent (Scenario 3-2 in Table S10), the potential for NDMA formation may exceed thousands of nanograms\nper liter, where the iminium ion is supposed to be the main driver\nfor the enhanced nitrosation reaction (Figure S24). Meanwhile, when nitrite is used as a reagent (Scenario\n3-3 in Table S10), trace quantities of\nDMA and formaldehyde may also lead to high concentrations of NDMA\n(>1.2 × 105 ng/L), catalyzed by both the carbinolamine\nand iminium ion pathways (Figure S25).\nA recent survey on industrial discharges in Switzerland also detected\nlarger concentrations of N-nitrosamines from chemical/pharmaceutical\nsynthesis processes, which is in agreement with the modeled results\nin the current study.22 Overall, the highest\nrisk of N-nitrosamine formation can be attributed\nto industrial wastewaters, and mitigation strategies should be implemented\nat this source. Aldehydes/nitrite are common components in some\nengineered systems impacted by industrial activities. For instance,\nbronopol, an antifouling agent in industrial cooling or hydraulic\nfracturing processes, may degrade into formaldehyde and nitrite and\ncontribute to N-nitrosamine formation when mixed\nwith water containing secondary amines.23,24 In amine-based\nCO2 capture systems, flue gas containing high concentrations\nof nitrite and aldehydes can also pose a risk for unintended formation\nof N-nitrosamines.25 Considering\nthe coexistence of numerous other amines and carbonyl compounds in\naqueous solutions, the total N-nitrosamine formation\nmight exceed the predicted levels reported in this study.\n\n## None\nFigures 1a–e depict the N-nitrosamine\nformation kinetics resulting from the nitrosation of five secondary\namines (10 mM) in the absence and presence of formaldehyde (10 mM)\nat pH 7 with a nitrite concentration of 50 mM. The observed rates\nof N-nitrosamine formation (rtotal) in the absence of formaldehyde are low for all secondary\namines, except for MOR (Figure 1e). The formation kinetics decreased in the following order:\nNMOR (0.17 μM min–1) ≫ NDMA (3.09 ×\n10–3 μM min–1) > NMEA\n(6.41\n× 10–4 μM min–1) >\nNPYR (3.69 × 10–4 μM min–1) > NDEA (1.62 × 10–4 μM min–1). In the presence of nitrite, nitrosation of secondary\namine occurs\nmainly through N2O3 (1.5 × 10–13 M in equilibrium with NO2–, eqs S4–S6 in Text S2) by a nucleophilic\nattack.34 Second-order rate constants for\nthe reactions of N2O3 with the selected secondary\namines were determined in this study (Text S6 and Figures S11 and 12) to be in the range of 2.3 × 107 to 2.1 × 108 M–1 s–1 (Table S4). This is comparable\nto previously reported values within a factor of 1.3 to 3.8 based\non the same method with N-nitrosamine formation measurements.28 The pKa of MOR (8.56)\nis much lower than those for the other four secondary amines (10.54–11.12).\nTherefore, at pH 7, the concentration of the neutral MOR is 2–3\norders of magnitude higher than those for the other four secondary\namines, which in turn accelerates the reaction between the secondary\namine and reactive nitrosating agents. The presence of formaldehyde\nfor the same experimental conditions significantly enhanced the formation\nkinetics by a factor of approximately 26, 29, 10, 152, and 5 for NDMA,\nNMEA, NDEA, NPYR, and NMOR, respectively (Figure 1f).

However, iminium ions are in equilibrium with carbinolamines\n(K3 = [iminium]/[carbinolamine], eq S13 in Text S5). Therefore, kiminium ion × K3 values (see detailed information in Text S5) were used as alternatives to kiminium ion in kinetic evaluation and are provided in Table S4. Using this indirect approach, the contribution of the iminium\nion pathway to N-nitrosamine formation can be estimated\n(Text S8), as illustrated in Figures S8 and S9. The iminium ion pathway is\ndominant under neutral and alkaline conditions. However, for more\nacidic conditions, the enhancement in the formation kinetics of N-nitrosamine cannot be fully explained by the iminium ion\npathway (riminium ion), except for\nMOR, as shown in Figures S8 and S9. This\nindicates that other pathways (carbinolamine pathway; see next section)\nmay also be important in the nitrosation process. Nitrosation of (a–e)\nsecondary amines (pH 8) by nitrite\nand (f–i) carbinolamines (pH 4) by N2O3 in the presence of formaldehyde. Linear relationship between (a–e) rtotal and [NO2–]0 (iminium ion pathway), (f–i) rcarbinolamine and [NO2–]20 (carbinolamine pathway). Experimental conditions:\n[secondary amine]0 = [formaldehyde]0 = 10 mM,\n[NO2–]0 = 1–50 mM,\npH = 4 or 8, phosphate buffer = 0.1 M.\n\n## Carbinolamine Pathway −N-Nitrosamine Formation from the\nReaction of Carbinolamine with N\nFigures 2f−i\nshow the correlation between the observed N-nitrosamine\nformation kinetics from the carbinolamine pathway (rcarbinolamine) (by subtracting the riminium ion and rR2NH from rtotal, eq S19 in Text S7) and the square of nitrite concentrations ([NO2–]2) in the range of 1 to 5 mM at pH 4 (see detailed information\nin Text S7). The linear relationship between rcarbinolamine and [NO2–]2, which is proportional to N2O3 (Text S2, eqs S4–S6), suggests\nthat N2O3 may act as the nitrosating agent,\nsimilar to the secondary amine pathway (eq 4, Figures S11 and S12). The estimated second-order rate constants for the reactions of\ncarbinolamines with N2O3, shown in Table S4, were on the same order of magnitude\nas those for secondary amines. Meanwhile, due to the much lower pKa of carbinolamines, the estimated relative\nconcentrations of neutral carbinolamines are generally higher than\nfor neutral secondary amines (Table S2 and Figure S7), which may enhance the formation of N-nitrosamine\nunder acidic conditions. Based on the fact that N-nitrosamine formation is enhanced in the presence of formaldehyde,\ncarbinolamine seems to be a precursor at lower pH. This is supported\nby quantum chemical computations and kinetic simulations discussed\nin the next sections.\n\n## Quantum Chemical Computations and Proposed \nQuantum chemical computations were performed to reveal embedded\npathways induced by secondary amines, iminium ions, and carbinolamines\nvia two nitrosating agents (NO2– and\nN2O3) for the formation of N-nitrosamines in the absence and presence of formaldehyde. As shown in Figure 3a, the aqueous-phase free energy\nprofiles for the reactions of neutral secondary amines with N2O3 were computed. Although a previous study showed\na one-step reaction for the formation of NDMA from the reaction of\nDMA with N2O3,48 our\ntheoretical results suggest that this pathway proceeds via two steps:\n(1) electrophilic attack of the amine nitrogen by the NO group of\nN2O3 for the formation of intermediates, R2N+H-NO + NO2–, with\nfree energies of activation between 8.5–9.4 kcal mol–1 and (2) a H-atom transfer reaction from the amine-nitrogen to the\nO-atom of NO2– with free energies of\nactivation between 3.3–10.3 kcal mol–1. When\nsecondary amines are in their protonated forms, the free energies\nof activation of the first step are significantly higher in the range\nof 39.1–42.1 kcal mol–1 (Figure S13), making this species practically unreactive, in\nagreement with a previous report.28 Calculated\nminimum energy pathway of nitrosation process from reactions\nof (a) secondary amine, (b) iminium ion, and (c) carbinolamine with\nthe corresponding nitrosating agents and (d) carbinolamine formation\nfrom the reaction of dimethylamine (DMA) with formaldehyde (R represents\nalkyl groups attached to nitrogen). The reactions of iminium ions with\nnitrite were found to proceed via a three-step pathway, as shown in Figure 3b: (1) electrophilic\nattack at the unsaturated carbon of iminium ions by the O-atom of\nNO2– for the formation of an intermediate,\nR2NCH2–ONO, with free energies of activation\nbetween 11.6–17.8 kcal mol–1; (2) O-atom\ntransfer from the ONO to the C-atom for the formation of R2N(NO)–CH2O with lower free energies of activation\nbetween −2.0–6.3 kcal mol–1; and (3)\nleaving of formaldehyde from the intermediate and formation of the\ncorresponding N-nitrosamine with negative free energies\nof activation. Iminium ions can undergo fast hydrolysis to generate\ncarbinolamines and are in equilibrium with them in water (Scheme 1c).32 Although this process is reversible and exergonic, significantly\nhigher free energies of activation (e.g., up to 37.9 kcal mol–1 for DMA, Figure S14) resulted\nin a slow conversion rate from carbinolamine back to the corresponding\niminium ion. This is in good agreement with the low concentrations\nof iminium ions in aqueous solution.32 The reactions between carbinolamines\nand N2O3 also proceed through a two-step process.\nThe free energies of activation for the first step of an electrophilic\nattack at the amine-N by NO of N2O3 generating\nintermediates R2N+(CH2OH)–NO\nare in the range of 3.4–10.5 kcal mol–1 (Figure 3c), comparable to\nthose of secondary amines. These results are also in accordance with\nthe similar second-order rate constants determined for the reactions\nof secondary amines and carbinolamines with N2O3. Significantly larger free energies of activation for the reaction\nof carbinolamines with NO2– (approximately\n55 kcal mol–1, Figure S15) further support that NO2– does not\ncontribute to the enhanced formation of N-nitrosamines\nunder acidic conditions. The intermediates undergo simultaneous cleavage\nof a C–H bond and structural arrangement to form N-nitrosamines, formaldehyde, and HNO2 (Figure 3c) with free energies of activation\nranging from 10 to 13.5 kcal mol–1. For the formation\nof carbinolamines from the reaction of neutral secondary amines with\nformaldehyde, computed free energies of activation range from 8.7\nto 11.2 kcal mol–1 (Figure S16), indicating little enhancement of carbinolamines formation. However,\nby addition of 1–3 explicit water molecules to account for\nexplicit hydrogen bonds representing the hydration of formaldehyde,\nthe free energies of activation for the reaction with DMA are reduced\nto 6.3 kcal mol–1 (one H2O molecule)\nand 1.5 kcal mol–1 (three H2O molecules)\ncompared to 8.7 kcal mol–1 without H2O molecules, supporting the significant enhancement of NDMA formation\nby including explicit hydrogen bond(s) in a hydration process (Figure 3d).\n\n## Secondary\nAmine Pathway\nAs shown in Figure 3a, the aqueous-phase free energy\nprofiles for the reactions of neutral secondary amines with N2O3 were computed. Although a previous study showed\na one-step reaction for the formation of NDMA from the reaction of\nDMA with N2O3,48 our\ntheoretical results suggest that this pathway proceeds via two steps:\n(1) electrophilic attack of the amine nitrogen by the NO group of\nN2O3 for the formation of intermediates, R2N+H-NO + NO2–, with\nfree energies of activation between 8.5–9.4 kcal mol–1 and (2) a H-atom transfer reaction from the amine-nitrogen to the\nO-atom of NO2– with free energies of\nactivation between 3.3–10.3 kcal mol–1. When\nsecondary amines are in their protonated forms, the free energies\nof activation of the first step are significantly higher in the range\nof 39.1–42.1 kcal mol–1 (Figure S13), making this species practically unreactive, in\nagreement with a previous report.28 Calculated\nminimum energy pathway of nitrosation process from reactions\nof (a) secondary amine, (b) iminium ion, and (c) carbinolamine with\nthe corresponding nitrosating agents and (d) carbinolamine formation\nfrom the reaction of dimethylamine (DMA) with formaldehyde (R represents\nalkyl groups attached to nitrogen).\n\n## Iminium Ion Pathway\nThe reactions of iminium ions with\nnitrite were found to proceed via a three-step pathway, as shown in Figure 3b: (1) electrophilic\nattack at the unsaturated carbon of iminium ions by the O-atom of\nNO2– for the formation of an intermediate,\nR2NCH2–ONO, with free energies of activation\nbetween 11.6–17.8 kcal mol–1; (2) O-atom\ntransfer from the ONO to the C-atom for the formation of R2N(NO)–CH2O with lower free energies of activation\nbetween −2.0–6.3 kcal mol–1; and (3)\nleaving of formaldehyde from the intermediate and formation of the\ncorresponding N-nitrosamine with negative free energies\nof activation. Iminium ions can undergo fast hydrolysis to generate\ncarbinolamines and are in equilibrium with them in water (Scheme 1c).32 Although this process is reversible and exergonic, significantly\nhigher free energies of activation (e.g., up to 37.9 kcal mol–1 for DMA, Figure S14) resulted\nin a slow conversion rate from carbinolamine back to the corresponding\niminium ion. This is in good agreement with the low concentrations\nof iminium ions in aqueous solution.32\n\n## Carbinolamine Pathway\nThe reactions between carbinolamines\nand N2O3 also proceed through a two-step process.\nThe free energies of activation for the first step of an electrophilic\nattack at the amine-N by NO of N2O3 generating\nintermediates R2N+(CH2OH)–NO\nare in the range of 3.4–10.5 kcal mol–1 (Figure 3c), comparable to\nthose of secondary amines. These results are also in accordance with\nthe similar second-order rate constants determined for the reactions\nof secondary amines and carbinolamines with N2O3. Significantly larger free energies of activation for the reaction\nof carbinolamines with NO2– (approximately\n55 kcal mol–1, Figure S15) further support that NO2– does not\ncontribute to the enhanced formation of N-nitrosamines\nunder acidic conditions. The intermediates undergo simultaneous cleavage\nof a C–H bond and structural arrangement to form N-nitrosamines, formaldehyde, and HNO2 (Figure 3c) with free energies of activation\nranging from 10 to 13.5 kcal mol–1. For the formation\nof carbinolamines from the reaction of neutral secondary amines with\nformaldehyde, computed free energies of activation range from 8.7\nto 11.2 kcal mol–1 (Figure S16), indicating little enhancement of carbinolamines formation. However,\nby addition of 1–3 explicit water molecules to account for\nexplicit hydrogen bonds representing the hydration of formaldehyde,\nthe free energies of activation for the reaction with DMA are reduced\nto 6.3 kcal mol–1 (one H2O molecule)\nand 1.5 kcal mol–1 (three H2O molecules)\ncompared to 8.7 kcal mol–1 without H2O molecules, supporting the significant enhancement of NDMA formation\nby including explicit hydrogen bond(s) in a hydration process (Figure 3d).\n\n## Kinetic\nSimulations of NDMA Formation\nBased on the\nrate constants for the reactions of secondary amines and carbinolamines\nwith N2O3 (at pH 4) and iminium ions with nitrite\n(at pH 8) obtained in this study (Table S4), a kinetic simulation of NDMA formation in the presence of formaldehyde\nwas performed in a wider range of pH (from 4 to 8) and nitrite concentrations\n(from 1 to 50 mM) with the Kintecus software (Table S1).43 In addition, the reaction\nof DMA with formaldehyde for the production of carbinolamine was considered\nin the simulation procedure to obtain a better prediction.44Figure S17 shows\nthat the predicted rtotal fitted well\nwith the experimental results at all of the nitrite concentrations\nand pH values tested. The carbinolamine pathway was found to dominate\nNDMA formation under acidic conditions, while the iminium ion pathway\nwas the key contributor under neutral and alkaline conditions in kinetic\nsimulation, which also agrees with the experimental observations in\nthe previous sections. At pH 4, we also observed a slower increase\nof rcarbinolamine as a function of [NO2–]2 at higher\nnitrite concentrations (5–50 mM), both in the simulated and\nexperimental results (Figure S18a), which\nis contrary to the linear tendency at lower nitrite concentrations\n(<5 mM, Figure 2). To address this issue, the evolution of carbinolamine during nitrosation\nat pH 4–8 was simulated with high nitrite concentrations (50\nmM) to elucidate the possible mechanism. As shown in Figure S19a, the simulated carbinolamine concentrations at\npH 4 in the absence of nitrite are 4.9-fold higher than those in the\npresence of nitrite. The reaction of DMA with formaldehyde was reported\nto be relatively fast (k = 5.6 × 103 M–1 s–1) and usually complete\nwithin seconds.44 Therefore, the lower\nsimulated carbinolamine concentrations at the lower pH indicate a\nfaster depletion by reaction with N2O3 under\nacidic conditions. This effect is enhanced by an increased N2O3 concentration (carbinolamine consumer) by a factor\nof ∼108, from 1.5 × 10–15 to 1.2 × 10–7 M when the pH decreased from\n8 to 4 (Table S3).\n\n## None\nIn addition to formaldehyde, other\ncarbonyl compounds are also detected in engineered aquatic systems.17,53−58 For instance, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone account for\nabout 90% of the total carbonyl compounds detected in water reuse\nsystems employing ozonation, with formaldehyde being the dominant\nspecies.17 Their concentrations range from\n<20 μg/L in drinking water17 to\nhundreds of mg/L in industrial effluent.16 As shown in Figure 4, compared to formaldehyde, only acetaldehyde showed a slight enhancement\neffect on N-nitrosamine formation. Benzaldehyde and\nacetone did not have an effect on the nitrosation reaction of the\nselected secondary amines, consistent with previous results.30 As discussed in the previous sections, iminium\nions are the key intermediates that promote N-nitrosamine\nformation under neutral pH conditions. Two reasons may explain the\ndifferent catalytic activities among the different carbonyl compounds.\nFirst, among the tested carbonyls, formaldehyde is the strongest electrophile\nwith small steric hindrances, which may result in higher concentrations\nof carbinolamines and iminium ions. This, in turn, may enhance the N-nitrosamine formation. Second, the reactivity of iminium\nions with nitrite is determined by their electrophilicities.59 An empirical structure–reactivity relationship\n(Text S5 and Table S5) suggests that the\nsecond-order rate constant for the reaction of the formaldehyde-derived\niminium ion with nitrite is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan that for benzaldehyde. Although such a semiquantitative method\nis typically applied in organic solvents and has some uncertainties\n(1–2 orders of magnitude), this assessment can still partially\nexplain the difference in the enhancement effects of different carbonyl\ncompounds.60 For the reactions of DMA with\nother carbonyl compounds such as acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and acetone\nfor the formation of NDMA, the computed free energies of activation\nare 16.7, 19.7, and 47 kcal mol–1, respectively\n(Figure S20). These activation energies\nare significantly higher compared with the reaction with formaldehyde\n(8.7 kcal mol–1), which is consistent with the experimental\nobservations presented in Figure 4. Future efforts to further elucidate the effects of\nfunctional groups on carbonyl compounds (steric hindrance and electronic\nproperties) on N-nitrosamine formation will help\nto better understand the underlying mechanisms. Effect of various carbonyl\ncompounds on the rates of N-nitrosamine formation\nfrom nitrosation of secondary amines in ultrapurified\nwater. Experimental conditions: [secondary amine]0 = [carbonyl\ncompounds]0 = 10 mM, [NO2–]0 = 50 mM, pH = 7, and phosphate buffer = 0.1 M.\n\n## Practical Implications\nThe results\nfrom this study\ndemonstrate the catalytic roles of carbonyl compounds in the conversion\nof amine precursors to N-nitrosamines via the iminium\nion and carbinolamine pathways. Carbonyl compounds may be present\nin aquatic systems from incomplete removal in water treatment processes\n(at low levels),34,61 industrial discharges (at medium\nlevels),62 and industrial production processes\n(e.g., Petasis reaction, using amines and carbonyl compounds at high\nlevels as substrates for the production of amino acids).63 Kinetic modeling was performed to evaluate the\nspecific potential for NDMA formation in these scenarios (Text S10). In typical water treatment processes\n(Scenario 1), the presence of trace amounts of formaldehyde (5 μM)\nmay lead to a 104-fold higher NDMA formation (Table S8), in which iminium ion acts as the key\nactive intermediate for enhancement (Figure S21). However, the potential for NDMA formation (<0.1 ng/L) will\nstill be far below any regulatory threshold (e.g., 100 ng/L in WHO\nguidelines) for NDMA due to insufficient precursor concentrations\nfor nitrosation reaction.10 When the concentrations\nof these precursors increase to medium levels in industrial discharges\n(Scenario 2), the presence of formaldehyde results in NDMA formation\npotentials in the μg/L level range (Table S9) exceeding the WHO guidelines for all simulated conditions.\nIn this scenario, the iminium ion is the key promoter at high pH and\ncarbinolamine also participates in the NDMA formation at low pH (Figure S22). The worst scenario can be assumed\nfor industrial production processes (Scenario 3). High DMA concentrations\n(0.1 M) may be used in synthetic processes, and traces of nitrite\nwere modeled to produce negligible quantities of NDMA (<0.01 ng/L, Table S10). However, when formaldehyde is copresent\nas a reagent (Scenario 3-2 in Table S10), the potential for NDMA formation may exceed thousands of nanograms\nper liter, where the iminium ion is supposed to be the main driver\nfor the enhanced nitrosation reaction (Figure S24). Meanwhile, when nitrite is used as a reagent (Scenario\n3-3 in Table S10), trace quantities of\nDMA and formaldehyde may also lead to high concentrations of NDMA\n(>1.2 × 105 ng/L), catalyzed by both the carbinolamine\nand iminium ion pathways (Figure S25).\nA recent survey on industrial discharges in Switzerland also detected\nlarger concentrations of N-nitrosamines from chemical/pharmaceutical\nsynthesis processes, which is in agreement with the modeled results\nin the current study.22 Overall, the highest\nrisk of N-nitrosamine formation can be attributed\nto industrial wastewaters, and mitigation strategies should be implemented\nat this source. Aldehydes/nitrite are common components in some\nengineered systems impacted by industrial activities. For instance,\nbronopol, an antifouling agent in industrial cooling or hydraulic\nfracturing processes, may degrade into formaldehyde and nitrite and\ncontribute to N-nitrosamine formation when mixed\nwith water containing secondary amines.23,24 In amine-based\nCO2 capture systems, flue gas containing high concentrations\nof nitrite and aldehydes can also pose a risk for unintended formation\nof N-nitrosamines.25 Considering\nthe coexistence of numerous other amines and carbonyl compounds in\naqueous solutions, the total N-nitrosamine formation\nmight exceed the predicted levels reported in this study.",
