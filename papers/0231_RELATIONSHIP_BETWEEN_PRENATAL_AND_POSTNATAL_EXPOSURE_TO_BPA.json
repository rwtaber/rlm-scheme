      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "The increasing incidence of allergic diseases is a serious public health problem. Exposure to environmental pollutants during prenatal and early life can increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases and allergies in later life [ 1 – 5 ]. Bisphenols, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are widely used in the production of plastics, thermal paper and epoxy resins and exposure of the general population can be through oral, dermal or inhalation routes [ 6 ]. Bisphenol A (BPA) is the most common representative of the bisphenol family. It can cross the blood-placental barrier and its presence has been detected in amniotic fluid or breast milk, suggesting that exposure may extend to both pregnancy and early childhood [ 7 ]. Continued exposure during key developmental periods of life (pregnancy, infancy and early childhood) may contribute to adverse health outcomes such as decreased lung function [ 8 , 9 ], wheezing and/or asthma [ 10 , 11 ], the occurrence of allergies [ 12 ] or changes in immune system responses [ 13 , 14 ]. Bisphenol A has been listed by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in the Candidate List of “substances of very high concern” which has led to a reduction in its production and the consequent emergence of substitutes including bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) [ 15 ]. As indicated by research findings, both BPS and BPF are hormonally active and can disrupt endocrine balance [ 16 , 17 ].\n\nThe available evidence on the effect of prenatal or postnatal exposure to BPA on the occurrence of allergic diseases in childhood has been summarized in several systematic reviews [ 18 – 21 ]. Robinson et al. [ 18 ], based on data from studies published up to 2015, note the lack of consistent conclusions regarding the role of BPA in the occurrence of allergy and asthma in children. Also, the results collected in a systematic review of the literature covering papers published up to 2016 are contradictory and inconclusive because 3 studies found prenatal exposure to BPA to be associated with an increased risk of wheezing/asthmain childhood, while 1 found a reduced risk of wheezing [ 19 ]. Wu et al. [ 20 ], based on a systematic review and meta-analysis, found that the risk of childhood asthma is increased by prenatal or postnatal exposure to BPA. Tang et al. [ 21 ], based on the results of a meta-analysis, pointed out that there was a positive association between exposure to BPA during pregnancy and the occurrence of allergic diseases in childhood.\n\nMethodological issues including the design of the study, the different period and level of exposure, not sufficient control for confounding variables, the age of the child and the methods used to assess allergic symptoms may be the reason for the differences observed in the results of previous studies.\n\nOn the other hand, none of the reviews presented here included studies evaluating the association between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to BPS and/or BPF and the occurrence of allergic diseases in childhood.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to present the current state of knowledge on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to BPA and its 2 main analogs BPS and BPF on the development of allergic diseases in childhood."

Initially, after reviewing the abstract and title, 805 irrelevant studies, 462 duplicates and 28 reviews were excluded. The main reasons for exclusion were: animal studies, concentrations of test bisphenols determined in biological material other than urine, lack of data on exposure to BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF. Fortyeight full-text articles remained, of which 8 epidemiological studies were found to be appropriate for inclusion in this publication. The detailed description selection process for studies included in the review is shown in  Figure 1 .\n\nThe detailed description of selection process for studies on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) on the development of allergic diseases in childhood, published in 2015–2021\n\nSeven of the included studies were cohort studies, 1 study was a cross-sectional survey and all of them analyzed the association between prenatal/postnatal exposure to BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF and the incidence of allergic diseases in children ( Table 1 ). All studies included in the review were published between 2015 and 2021. The studies were carried out in 4 countries, 1 in Spain, 1 in France, 3 in China and 3 in the United States. According to the established criteria, collected urine samples were used to assess exposure to selected bisphenols.\n\nCharacteristics of studies (published in 2015–2021) included in the systematic review on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) on the development of allergic diseases in childhood\n\nISAAC – International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children.\n\nTh1 – T helper 1; Th2 – T helper 2, wk gest – gestational weeks.\n\nIn 6 out of 8 studies, included in the review the concentration of bisphenols was measured in maternal urine collected during pregnancy (in 4 studies the urine was collected during the third trimester of pregnancy and in 2 it was collected twice during the first and the second trimester of pregnancy). In 2 studies it was measured in urine collected from children aged ≥3–12 years.\n\nOnly in 2 studies, concentrations of BPA and its main analogs (BPS, BPF) were determined, in the remaining studies, only BPA concentrations were determined. The size of the study population ranged 111–3538 participants.  Table 2  shows concentrations of BPA, BPS and BPF in maternal/child urine collected during pregnancy/childhood. In most studies (N = 7), allergic diseases in children were diagnosed on the basis of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) recommendations [ 23 ]. In the study by Mendy et al. the other questionnaire completed by parents was used [ 24 ]. In all of the above studies the adjustment for potential confounders was performed. The following covariates were among the most frequently evaluated: maternal age, maternal education, maternal active or passive smoking during pregnancy, parental positive history of allergy. Maternal education level was included in all studies while maternal smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy was included in most studies ( Table 3 ).\n\nConcentrations of the bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) in maternal urine in studies published in 2015–2021\n\nn.a. – not available.\n\nBPAG – BPA glucuronide; SG-BPA* – urinary specific gravity adjusted BPA (ng/ml).\n\nGM – geometric mean; GSD – geometric standard deviation; wk gest – gestational weeks.\n\nAverage of 2 measurements.\n\nConfounders adjusted for model's study in studies on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) on the development of allergic diseases in childhood published in 2015–2021\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of wheezing and asthma in children. Three studies evaluated the association between prenatal exposure to BPA and childhood wheezing [ 11 , 25 , 26 ]. Only in an analysis by Gascon et al. [ 11 ] it was observed that prenatal exposure to BPA may increase the risk of wheezing in offspring (relative risk (RR) 1.20 [1.03, 1.40; p = 0.02]). The impact of prenatal BPA exposure on the occurrence of asthma symptoms in childhood was analyzed in 4 studies [ 11 , 12 , 25 , 26 ]. However, only Buckley et al. [ 26 ] indicated that prenatal exposure to BPA may increase the risk of asthma symptoms in 6–7 year old boys (odds ratio (OR) 1.66 [1.04, 2.66; p = 0.03]). Wang et al [ 27 ], and Mendy et al. [ 24 ] evaluated the association between postnatal urinary BPA concentrations and measures of asthma morbidity. Evidence from a study by Wang et al. [ 27 ] suggests that childhood exposure to BPA may increase the risk of asthma in 3– and 6–year-olds (OR 1.29 [1.08, 1.55; p ≤ 0.05], OR 1.27 [1.04, 1.55; p ≤ 0.05] asthma at 3 and 6 years of age and BPAG level at 3 years of age, respectively), (OR 1.50 [1.06, 2.11; p ≤ 0.05] asthma at 6 years of age and BPAG level at 6 years of age) [ 27 ]. Only Mendy et al. [ 24 ] additionally examined the relationship between BPF and BPS concentrations in children's urine samples and the occurrence of asthma. Results suggested that exposure to BPF was positively associated with current asthma (OR 1.54 [1.16, 2.04; p = 0.003]).\n\nAssociations between prenatal/postnatal bisphenols levels and wheezing or/and asthma, eczema/atopic dermatitis, and aeroallergies, allergic rhinitis in children in studies published in 2015–2021\n\nBPA – bisphenol A; BPF – bisphenol F; BPS – bisphenol S; Cr–BPA – creatinine adjusted BPA; SG–BPA – urinary specific gravity adjusted BPA.\n\nHR – hazard rate; OR – odds ratio; RR – relative risk.\n\nAssociation of allergic diseases at age\n\n3 and 6 years and urine BPAG levels (ng/ml) at 3 years,\n\n6 years and urine BPAG levels (ng/ml) at 6 years.\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal orpostnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of eczema and atopic dermatitis. A total of 5 studies evaluated the association between BPA exposure and the risk of eczema/atopic dermatitis in children (in 4 studies prenatal exposure and in 1 study postnatal exposure were considered) [ 11 , 12 ,  26 – 28 ]. Only Li et al. [ 28 ] noted that higher levels of BPA exposure during pregnancy increased the risk of developing infantile eczema (OR 2.73 [1.06, 7.01; p = 0.04]). In analyses focusing on BPS and BPF exposure, the result was not statistically significant.\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of aeroallergies/allergic rhinitis in children [ 12 ,  24 ,  27 ]. Only 1 study focused on the association between prenatal exposure to BPA and the incidence of aeroallergies – the result was not statistically significant [ 12 ]. According to Mendy et al. [ 24 ] higher concentration of postnatal exposure to BPF was positively associated with allergic rhinitis, (OR 1.66 [1.12, 2.46; p = 0.01]) [ 24 ].\n\nBased on the results, Zhou et al. [ 29 ] highlighted that prenatal exposure to BPA may contribute to the increased risk of allergic diseases in early childhood in girls. The study focused on 2 types of allergic diseases in childhood: eczema and wheezing ( Table 4 ) [ 29 ].\n\nThe data collected in this review suggest that there is an association between maternal exposure during pregnancy or childhood to BPA and the development of allergic diseases. Most studies reported positive relationships between BPA exposure and at least 1 of the types of allergic diseases, the exception being the study by Vernet et al. [ 25 ]. However, the authors highlight an observedtrend towards an increased risk of asthma in 5–year-old boys as a result of prenatal BPA exposure [ 25 ]. Only 2 studies have evaluated the effects of BPS and BPF on the development of allergies in children (1 study prenatal exposure, the other postnatal) including various types of allergic diseases [ 24 , 28 ]. Li et al. [ 28 ] suggested no association between maternal exposure during pregnancy to BPS or BPF and the occurrence of infantile eczema. On the other hand, the results of a study by Mendy et al. [ 24 ] indicated that exposure of children aged 12 years and older to BPS and BPF may be associated with a higher risk of asthma and/or hay fever. Conclusions based on such a small amount of data are very conservative.\n\nThe authors' results on BPA exposure are consistent with those published in earlier reviews and included in metaanalyses [ 19 – 21 ,  30 ]. Tang et al. [ 21 ] concluded on the basis of their metaanalysis that prenatal exposure to BPA may be responsible for the development of allergic diseases in childhood. Wu et al. [ 20 ] emphasized that both prenatal and postnatal exposure to BPA can increase the risk of asthma symptoms. At the same time, the results of a metaanalysis suggest that BPA exposure in early pregnancy (up to 16 weeks) and postnatally may contribute to wheezing [ 20 ]. Data from a random-effects meta-analysis on individual participant data from 8 European birth cohorts suggest a positive association between maternal exposure during pregnancy to BPA and the occurrence of asthma and wheezing among school-aged girls [ 30 ].\n\nThe potential mechanisms linking the occurrence of allergic diseases to BPA exposure are not fully understood. It has been established that maternal exposure to environmental contaminants can impair the development of the immune system through disruption of epigenetics [ 31 ]. The ability of BPA to cross the placental barrier may explain the formation of genetic and epigenetic changes such as disruption of cellular functions and trophoblast invasiveness [ 32 , 33 ]. Bisphenol A may have a modulatory effect on the immune system. These effects have been observed in rodent and human studies and may include: increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and serum IgE immuno-globulins, increased eosinophilic airway inflammation, Th1/Th2 shift and also changes in Th17 abundance [ 34 – 36 ]. Studies are available indicating an association between BPA exposure and the occurrence of oxidative stress, which is suspected to be related to the development of asthma [ 37 – 39 ]. It is worth noting that BPA, as an allergen, may directly contribute to the development of allergies [ 18 ]. In addition, BPA is estrogenic and has an affinity for estrogen receptors, which may explain the suggested links between estrogen activity and asthma [ 40 – 43 ].\n\nThis review is based on the most recent available studies on the association between prenatal/postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of allergic diseases in children. To minimize subjective assessment, full-text reviews were carried out by 2 independent reviewers. The majority of the studies included in the review were cohort studies, which may provide evidence of causality between exposure and outcomes.\n\nA limitation of the study may be the small number of studies that met the review's inclusion criteria. In addition, most studies based their exposure assessment on a single urine collection, which may not be sufficient to fully assess exposure given the short half-life. In addition, urine samples were collected from women of different gestational ages (2 studies – first trimester, 2 studies – second trimester, 4 studies – third trimester) and from children of different ages. The assessment of the association between prenatal/postnatal exposure to BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF and the occurrence of allergic diseases in children also included an age-differentiated group. Moreover, the outcomes assessments may constitute the limitation of the studies. The small number of studies analyzing the association between prenatal/postnatal exposure to BPS and/or BPF did not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn."

Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2023;36(5):575–86\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe increasing incidence of allergic diseases is a serious public health problem. Exposure to environmental pollutants during prenatal and early life can increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases and allergies in later life [ 1 – 5 ]. Bisphenols, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are widely used in the production of plastics, thermal paper and epoxy resins and exposure of the general population can be through oral, dermal or inhalation routes [ 6 ]. Bisphenol A (BPA) is the most common representative of the bisphenol family. It can cross the blood-placental barrier and its presence has been detected in amniotic fluid or breast milk, suggesting that exposure may extend to both pregnancy and early childhood [ 7 ]. Continued exposure during key developmental periods of life (pregnancy, infancy and early childhood) may contribute to adverse health outcomes such as decreased lung function [ 8 , 9 ], wheezing and/or asthma [ 10 , 11 ], the occurrence of allergies [ 12 ] or changes in immune system responses [ 13 , 14 ]. Bisphenol A has been listed by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in the Candidate List of “substances of very high concern” which has led to a reduction in its production and the consequent emergence of substitutes including bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS) [ 15 ]. As indicated by research findings, both BPS and BPF are hormonally active and can disrupt endocrine balance [ 16 , 17 ].\n\nThe available evidence on the effect of prenatal or postnatal exposure to BPA on the occurrence of allergic diseases in childhood has been summarized in several systematic reviews [ 18 – 21 ]. Robinson et al. [ 18 ], based on data from studies published up to 2015, note the lack of consistent conclusions regarding the role of BPA in the occurrence of allergy and asthma in children. Also, the results collected in a systematic review of the literature covering papers published up to 2016 are contradictory and inconclusive because 3 studies found prenatal exposure to BPA to be associated with an increased risk of wheezing/asthmain childhood, while 1 found a reduced risk of wheezing [ 19 ]. Wu et al. [ 20 ], based on a systematic review and meta-analysis, found that the risk of childhood asthma is increased by prenatal or postnatal exposure to BPA. Tang et al. [ 21 ], based on the results of a meta-analysis, pointed out that there was a positive association between exposure to BPA during pregnancy and the occurrence of allergic diseases in childhood.\n\nMethodological issues including the design of the study, the different period and level of exposure, not sufficient control for confounding variables, the age of the child and the methods used to assess allergic symptoms may be the reason for the differences observed in the results of previous studies.\n\nOn the other hand, none of the reviews presented here included studies evaluating the association between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to BPS and/or BPF and the occurrence of allergic diseases in childhood.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to present the current state of knowledge on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to BPA and its 2 main analogs BPS and BPF on the development of allergic diseases in childhood.\n\n## METHODS\n\nThis summary was prepared in accordance with the components of The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 (PRISMA 2020) [ 22 ].\n\nInclusion criteria for the review were defined as follows:\n study performed in humans; published since 2015, in English in peer-reviewed journals; the concentration of bisphenols (BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF) was determined in urine samples collected from the mother at least once during pregnancy or from children; the relationship between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols (BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF) and the occurrence of allergic diseases in children was assessed; the occurrence of the following health effects in children was assessed: asthma, wheezing, eczema/atopic dermatitis, aeroallergies, allergic rhinitis; results were given as odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).\n\nstudy performed in humans;\n\npublished since 2015, in English in peer-reviewed journals;\n\nthe concentration of bisphenols (BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF) was determined in urine samples collected from the mother at least once during pregnancy or from children;\n\nthe relationship between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols (BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF) and the occurrence of allergic diseases in children was assessed;\n\nthe occurrence of the following health effects in children was assessed:\n\neczema/atopic dermatitis,\n\nresults were given as odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).\n\nArticles without full text, meta-analyses, or reviews were not eligible for review.\n\nA comprehensive and systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify studies that analyzed the association between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to BPA and/or 2 of its analogs BPS and BPF and the incidence of allergic diseases in children. The search was conducted in October–December 2022 based on keywords used in various combinations: bisphenols exposure, bisphenol A or BPA child exposure, bisphenol S or BPS child exposure, bisphenol F or BPF child exposure, allergic diseases, childhood wheezing/asthma, lung function, childhood eczema/atopic dermatitis.\n\nTwo independent reviewers conducted a literature search and review, taking into account the inclusion criteria. In the first step, non-relevant references were removed on the basis of the title and abstract due to ineligibility. The second stage was to review the full text, and the resulting doubts and inconsistencies were dispelled and eliminated through discussion.\n\nIn the selection process, reviewers from all publications identified the following key information: first author name, publication year, study design and population characteristics (study name, country, study period, sample size, children's age), maternal or children exposure period, urinary BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF concentrations, respiratory outcome, the methods used to diagnose allergic disease, confounding factors and the results of analysis.\n\n## Eligibility criteria\n\nInclusion criteria for the review were defined as follows:\n study performed in humans; published since 2015, in English in peer-reviewed journals; the concentration of bisphenols (BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF) was determined in urine samples collected from the mother at least once during pregnancy or from children; the relationship between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols (BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF) and the occurrence of allergic diseases in children was assessed; the occurrence of the following health effects in children was assessed: asthma, wheezing, eczema/atopic dermatitis, aeroallergies, allergic rhinitis; results were given as odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).\n\nstudy performed in humans;\n\npublished since 2015, in English in peer-reviewed journals;\n\nthe concentration of bisphenols (BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF) was determined in urine samples collected from the mother at least once during pregnancy or from children;\n\nthe relationship between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols (BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF) and the occurrence of allergic diseases in children was assessed;\n\nthe occurrence of the following health effects in children was assessed:\n\neczema/atopic dermatitis,\n\nresults were given as odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).\n\nArticles without full text, meta-analyses, or reviews were not eligible for review.\n\n## Information sources search strategy\n\nA comprehensive and systematic search of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify studies that analyzed the association between prenatal and/or postnatal exposure to BPA and/or 2 of its analogs BPS and BPF and the incidence of allergic diseases in children.

Initially, after reviewing the abstract and title, 805 irrelevant studies, 462 duplicates and 28 reviews were excluded. The main reasons for exclusion were: animal studies, concentrations of test bisphenols determined in biological material other than urine, lack of data on exposure to BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF. Fortyeight full-text articles remained, of which 8 epidemiological studies were found to be appropriate for inclusion in this publication. The detailed description selection process for studies included in the review is shown in  Figure 1 .\n\nThe detailed description of selection process for studies on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) on the development of allergic diseases in childhood, published in 2015–2021\n\nSeven of the included studies were cohort studies, 1 study was a cross-sectional survey and all of them analyzed the association between prenatal/postnatal exposure to BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF and the incidence of allergic diseases in children ( Table 1 ). All studies included in the review were published between 2015 and 2021. The studies were carried out in 4 countries, 1 in Spain, 1 in France, 3 in China and 3 in the United States. According to the established criteria, collected urine samples were used to assess exposure to selected bisphenols.\n\nCharacteristics of studies (published in 2015–2021) included in the systematic review on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) on the development of allergic diseases in childhood\n\nISAAC – International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children.\n\nTh1 – T helper 1; Th2 – T helper 2, wk gest – gestational weeks.\n\nIn 6 out of 8 studies, included in the review the concentration of bisphenols was measured in maternal urine collected during pregnancy (in 4 studies the urine was collected during the third trimester of pregnancy and in 2 it was collected twice during the first and the second trimester of pregnancy). In 2 studies it was measured in urine collected from children aged ≥3–12 years.\n\nOnly in 2 studies, concentrations of BPA and its main analogs (BPS, BPF) were determined, in the remaining studies, only BPA concentrations were determined. The size of the study population ranged 111–3538 participants.  Table 2  shows concentrations of BPA, BPS and BPF in maternal/child urine collected during pregnancy/childhood. In most studies (N = 7), allergic diseases in children were diagnosed on the basis of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) recommendations [ 23 ]. In the study by Mendy et al. the other questionnaire completed by parents was used [ 24 ]. In all of the above studies the adjustment for potential confounders was performed. The following covariates were among the most frequently evaluated: maternal age, maternal education, maternal active or passive smoking during pregnancy, parental positive history of allergy. Maternal education level was included in all studies while maternal smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy was included in most studies ( Table 3 ).\n\nConcentrations of the bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) in maternal urine in studies published in 2015–2021\n\nn.a. – not available.\n\nBPAG – BPA glucuronide; SG-BPA* – urinary specific gravity adjusted BPA (ng/ml).\n\nGM – geometric mean; GSD – geometric standard deviation; wk gest – gestational weeks.\n\nAverage of 2 measurements.\n\nConfounders adjusted for model's study in studies on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) on the development of allergic diseases in childhood published in 2015–2021\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of wheezing and asthma in children. Three studies evaluated the association between prenatal exposure to BPA and childhood wheezing [ 11 , 25 , 26 ]. Only in an analysis by Gascon et al. [ 11 ] it was observed that prenatal exposure to BPA may increase the risk of wheezing in offspring (relative risk (RR) 1.20 [1.03, 1.40; p = 0.02]). The impact of prenatal BPA exposure on the occurrence of asthma symptoms in childhood was analyzed in 4 studies [ 11 , 12 , 25 , 26 ]. However, only Buckley et al. [ 26 ] indicated that prenatal exposure to BPA may increase the risk of asthma symptoms in 6–7 year old boys (odds ratio (OR) 1.66 [1.04, 2.66; p = 0.03]). Wang et al [ 27 ], and Mendy et al. [ 24 ] evaluated the association between postnatal urinary BPA concentrations and measures of asthma morbidity. Evidence from a study by Wang et al. [ 27 ] suggests that childhood exposure to BPA may increase the risk of asthma in 3– and 6–year-olds (OR 1.29 [1.08, 1.55; p ≤ 0.05], OR 1.27 [1.04, 1.55; p ≤ 0.05] asthma at 3 and 6 years of age and BPAG level at 3 years of age, respectively), (OR 1.50 [1.06, 2.11; p ≤ 0.05] asthma at 6 years of age and BPAG level at 6 years of age) [ 27 ]. Only Mendy et al. [ 24 ] additionally examined the relationship between BPF and BPS concentrations in children's urine samples and the occurrence of asthma. Results suggested that exposure to BPF was positively associated with current asthma (OR 1.54 [1.16, 2.04; p = 0.003]).\n\nAssociations between prenatal/postnatal bisphenols levels and wheezing or/and asthma, eczema/atopic dermatitis, and aeroallergies, allergic rhinitis in children in studies published in 2015–2021\n\nBPA – bisphenol A; BPF – bisphenol F; BPS – bisphenol S; Cr–BPA – creatinine adjusted BPA; SG–BPA – urinary specific gravity adjusted BPA.\n\nHR – hazard rate; OR – odds ratio; RR – relative risk.\n\nAssociation of allergic diseases at age\n\n3 and 6 years and urine BPAG levels (ng/ml) at 3 years,\n\n6 years and urine BPAG levels (ng/ml) at 6 years.\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal orpostnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of eczema and atopic dermatitis. A total of 5 studies evaluated the association between BPA exposure and the risk of eczema/atopic dermatitis in children (in 4 studies prenatal exposure and in 1 study postnatal exposure were considered) [ 11 , 12 ,  26 – 28 ]. Only Li et al. [ 28 ] noted that higher levels of BPA exposure during pregnancy increased the risk of developing infantile eczema (OR 2.73 [1.06, 7.01; p = 0.04]). In analyses focusing on BPS and BPF exposure, the result was not statistically significant.\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of aeroallergies/allergic rhinitis in children [ 12 ,  24 ,  27 ]. Only 1 study focused on the association between prenatal exposure to BPA and the incidence of aeroallergies – the result was not statistically significant [ 12 ]. According to Mendy et al. [ 24 ] higher concentration of postnatal exposure to BPF was positively associated with allergic rhinitis, (OR 1.66 [1.12, 2.46; p = 0.01]) [ 24 ].\n\nBased on the results, Zhou et al. [ 29 ] highlighted that prenatal exposure to BPA may contribute to the increased risk of allergic diseases in early childhood in girls. The study focused on 2 types of allergic diseases in childhood: eczema and wheezing ( Table 4 ) [ 29 ].\n\nThe data collected in this review suggest that there is an association between maternal exposure during pregnancy or childhood to BPA and the development of allergic diseases. Most studies reported positive relationships between BPA exposure and at least 1 of the types of allergic diseases, the exception being the study by Vernet et al. [ 25 ].

In most studies (N = 7), allergic diseases in children were diagnosed on the basis of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) recommendations [ 23 ]. In the study by Mendy et al. the other questionnaire completed by parents was used [ 24 ]. In all of the above studies the adjustment for potential confounders was performed. The following covariates were among the most frequently evaluated: maternal age, maternal education, maternal active or passive smoking during pregnancy, parental positive history of allergy. Maternal education level was included in all studies while maternal smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy was included in most studies ( Table 3 ).\n\nConcentrations of the bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) in maternal urine in studies published in 2015–2021\n\nn.a. – not available.\n\nBPAG – BPA glucuronide; SG-BPA* – urinary specific gravity adjusted BPA (ng/ml).\n\nGM – geometric mean; GSD – geometric standard deviation; wk gest – gestational weeks.\n\nAverage of 2 measurements.\n\nConfounders adjusted for model's study in studies on the effects of prenatal or postnatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) on the development of allergic diseases in childhood published in 2015–2021\n\n## Bisphenols\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of wheezing and asthma in children. Three studies evaluated the association between prenatal exposure to BPA and childhood wheezing [ 11 , 25 , 26 ]. Only in an analysis by Gascon et al. [ 11 ] it was observed that prenatal exposure to BPA may increase the risk of wheezing in offspring (relative risk (RR) 1.20 [1.03, 1.40; p = 0.02]). The impact of prenatal BPA exposure on the occurrence of asthma symptoms in childhood was analyzed in 4 studies [ 11 , 12 , 25 , 26 ]. However, only Buckley et al. [ 26 ] indicated that prenatal exposure to BPA may increase the risk of asthma symptoms in 6–7 year old boys (odds ratio (OR) 1.66 [1.04, 2.66; p = 0.03]). Wang et al [ 27 ], and Mendy et al. [ 24 ] evaluated the association between postnatal urinary BPA concentrations and measures of asthma morbidity. Evidence from a study by Wang et al. [ 27 ] suggests that childhood exposure to BPA may increase the risk of asthma in 3– and 6–year-olds (OR 1.29 [1.08, 1.55; p ≤ 0.05], OR 1.27 [1.04, 1.55; p ≤ 0.05] asthma at 3 and 6 years of age and BPAG level at 3 years of age, respectively), (OR 1.50 [1.06, 2.11; p ≤ 0.05] asthma at 6 years of age and BPAG level at 6 years of age) [ 27 ]. Only Mendy et al. [ 24 ] additionally examined the relationship between BPF and BPS concentrations in children's urine samples and the occurrence of asthma. Results suggested that exposure to BPF was positively associated with current asthma (OR 1.54 [1.16, 2.04; p = 0.003]).\n\nAssociations between prenatal/postnatal bisphenols levels and wheezing or/and asthma, eczema/atopic dermatitis, and aeroallergies, allergic rhinitis in children in studies published in 2015–2021\n\nBPA – bisphenol A; BPF – bisphenol F; BPS – bisphenol S; Cr–BPA – creatinine adjusted BPA; SG–BPA – urinary specific gravity adjusted BPA.\n\nHR – hazard rate; OR – odds ratio; RR – relative risk.\n\nAssociation of allergic diseases at age\n\n3 and 6 years and urine BPAG levels (ng/ml) at 3 years,\n\n6 years and urine BPAG levels (ng/ml) at 6 years.\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal orpostnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of eczema and atopic dermatitis. A total of 5 studies evaluated the association between BPA exposure and the risk of eczema/atopic dermatitis in children (in 4 studies prenatal exposure and in 1 study postnatal exposure were considered) [ 11 , 12 ,  26 – 28 ]. Only Li et al. [ 28 ] noted that higher levels of BPA exposure during pregnancy increased the risk of developing infantile eczema (OR 2.73 [1.06, 7.01; p = 0.04]). In analyses focusing on BPS and BPF exposure, the result was not statistically significant.\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of aeroallergies/allergic rhinitis in children [ 12 ,  24 ,  27 ]. Only 1 study focused on the association between prenatal exposure to BPA and the incidence of aeroallergies – the result was not statistically significant [ 12 ]. According to Mendy et al. [ 24 ] higher concentration of postnatal exposure to BPF was positively associated with allergic rhinitis, (OR 1.66 [1.12, 2.46; p = 0.01]) [ 24 ].\n\nBased on the results, Zhou et al. [ 29 ] highlighted that prenatal exposure to BPA may contribute to the increased risk of allergic diseases in early childhood in girls. The study focused on 2 types of allergic diseases in childhood: eczema and wheezing ( Table 4 ) [ 29 ].\n\n## Childhood wheezing and asthma\n\nTable 4  shows the results of studies analyzing the association between prenatal or postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of wheezing and asthma in children. Three studies evaluated the association between prenatal exposure to BPA and childhood wheezing [ 11 , 25 , 26 ]. Only in an analysis by Gascon et al.

Only Mendy et al. [ 24 ] additionally examined the relationship between BPF and BPS concentrations in children's urine samples and the occurrence of asthma.

Only 1 study focused on the association between prenatal exposure to BPA and the incidence of aeroallergies – the result was not statistically significant [ 12 ]. According to Mendy et al. [ 24 ] higher concentration of postnatal exposure to BPF was positively associated with allergic rhinitis, (OR 1.66 [1.12, 2.46; p = 0.01]) [ 24 ].\n\n## Allergic diseases (including eczema and wheezing)\n\nBased on the results, Zhou et al. [ 29 ] highlighted that prenatal exposure to BPA may contribute to the increased risk of allergic diseases in early childhood in girls. The study focused on 2 types of allergic diseases in childhood: eczema and wheezing ( Table 4 ) [ 29 ].\n\n## Interpretation of the results\n\nThe data collected in this review suggest that there is an association between maternal exposure during pregnancy or childhood to BPA and the development of allergic diseases. Most studies reported positive relationships between BPA exposure and at least 1 of the types of allergic diseases, the exception being the study by Vernet et al. [ 25 ]. However, the authors highlight an observedtrend towards an increased risk of asthma in 5–year-old boys as a result of prenatal BPA exposure [ 25 ]. Only 2 studies have evaluated the effects of BPS and BPF on the development of allergies in children (1 study prenatal exposure, the other postnatal) including various types of allergic diseases [ 24 , 28 ]. Li et al. [ 28 ] suggested no association between maternal exposure during pregnancy to BPS or BPF and the occurrence of infantile eczema. On the other hand, the results of a study by Mendy et al. [ 24 ] indicated that exposure of children aged 12 years and older to BPS and BPF may be associated with a higher risk of asthma and/or hay fever. Conclusions based on such a small amount of data are very conservative.\n\nThe authors' results on BPA exposure are consistent with those published in earlier reviews and included in metaanalyses [ 19 – 21 ,  30 ]. Tang et al. [ 21 ] concluded on the basis of their metaanalysis that prenatal exposure to BPA may be responsible for the development of allergic diseases in childhood. Wu et al. [ 20 ] emphasized that both prenatal and postnatal exposure to BPA can increase the risk of asthma symptoms. At the same time, the results of a metaanalysis suggest that BPA exposure in early pregnancy (up to 16 weeks) and postnatally may contribute to wheezing [ 20 ]. Data from a random-effects meta-analysis on individual participant data from 8 European birth cohorts suggest a positive association between maternal exposure during pregnancy to BPA and the occurrence of asthma and wheezing among school-aged girls [ 30 ].\n\nThe potential mechanisms linking the occurrence of allergic diseases to BPA exposure are not fully understood. It has been established that maternal exposure to environmental contaminants can impair the development of the immune system through disruption of epigenetics [ 31 ]. The ability of BPA to cross the placental barrier may explain the formation of genetic and epigenetic changes such as disruption of cellular functions and trophoblast invasiveness [ 32 , 33 ]. Bisphenol A may have a modulatory effect on the immune system. These effects have been observed in rodent and human studies and may include: increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and serum IgE immuno-globulins, increased eosinophilic airway inflammation, Th1/Th2 shift and also changes in Th17 abundance [ 34 – 36 ]. Studies are available indicating an association between BPA exposure and the occurrence of oxidative stress, which is suspected to be related to the development of asthma [ 37 – 39 ]. It is worth noting that BPA, as an allergen, may directly contribute to the development of allergies [ 18 ]. In addition, BPA is estrogenic and has an affinity for estrogen receptors, which may explain the suggested links between estrogen activity and asthma [ 40 – 43 ].\n\n## Strengths and limitations\n\nThis review is based on the most recent available studies on the association between prenatal/postnatal exposure to selected bisphenols and the occurrence of allergic diseases in children. To minimize subjective assessment, full-text reviews were carried out by 2 independent reviewers. The majority of the studies included in the review were cohort studies, which may provide evidence of causality between exposure and outcomes.\n\nA limitation of the study may be the small number of studies that met the review's inclusion criteria. In addition, most studies based their exposure assessment on a single urine collection, which may not be sufficient to fully assess exposure given the short half-life. In addition, urine samples were collected from women of different gestational ages (2 studies – first trimester, 2 studies – second trimester, 4 studies – third trimester) and from children of different ages. The assessment of the association between prenatal/postnatal exposure to BPA and/or BPS and/or BPF and the occurrence of allergic diseases in children also included an age-differentiated group. Moreover, the outcomes assessments may constitute the limitation of the studies. The small number of studies analyzing the association between prenatal/postnatal exposure to BPS and/or BPF did not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nExposure to environmental factors, individual genetic susceptibility, and their interactions contribute to the increased incidence of allergic diseases. Further research is needed to identify the vulnerable population and the mechanisms responsible for the development of undesirable health consequences.",
