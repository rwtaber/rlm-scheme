  "abstract": "The chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols is frequently\ninvestigated offline via mass spectrometry techniques. The established\noffline aerosol mass spectrometry (Off-AMS) uses water for extracting\nairborne particulate filter samples, efficiently detecting water-soluble\nconstituents of organic aerosols (OA), which are prevalent in secondary\nOA (SOA), oxygenated primary OA (POA), and aged POA. Consequently,\nsources with substantial water-insoluble fraction may be undetectable\nvia Off-AMS or be subject to increased uncertainties due to the absence\nof useful markers (e.g., polycyclic aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons).\nThis potentially compromises the investigation of primary and less-aged\nOA from diverse anthropogenic sources (e.g., traffic, coal combustion,\nwaste burning, tire wear, among others). Here, we present a new analytical\nmethod that combines Off-AMS with organic solvent-based sample extraction\n(termed: SOff-AMS) to extract and quantify both aged and fresh aerosols\nsimultaneously. Ultrahigh-purity methanol and high-purity acetone\nwere used, alongside water as a reference, and the extracts were reaerosolized\nto be analyzed via a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer\n(ToF-AMS). Multiseason airborne particulate matter (PM) filter samples\ncollected in urban and rural environments were used in these tests.\nThe organic solvents extracted substantially higher fractions of organic\ncarbon, which for winter samples ranged from 45 to 85% of the total\norganic carbon in comparison to 12–40% in water alone. The\nAMS spectra of samples extracted in organic solvents showed significantly\nincreased contributions from OA fragments that are known tracers of\nfresh and aged emissions. These included small and polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons and oxygenated and reduced nitrogen-containing fragments\nthat were enhanced over a broad range of factors (1.2–50).\nA comparison with an online quadrupole aerosol chemical speciation\nmass spectrometer (Q-ACSM) in Krakow showed highly similar spectra,\ndemonstrating that SOff-AMS-based offline measurements can provide\nvery similar information as the online data. Future SOff-AMS-based\nsource apportionment could identify air pollution sources more comprehensively\nregardless of sampling locations, particle sizes, and seasonal conditions,\nespecially in complex urban areas with both primary and secondary\nsource contributors.",

      "text": "Organic aerosols (OA)\nconstitute a large fraction of airborne particulate\nmatter and impact both the climate and human health.\n,\n OA is either directly emitted (primary; POA) or is formed via atmospheric\noxidation of gas-phase precursors (secondary; SOA) emitted from diverse\nanthropogenic (e.g., motor vehicles, solid-fuel combustion, asphalt)\nand biogenic (e.g., forests) sources. It is essential to characterize\nthe chemical composition of OA in order to identify its contributing\nsources and constrain their impact. In recent decades, advances\nin mass spectrometry have significantly\nenhanced our understanding of the OA composition and formation processes.\n−\n\n Online techniques, e.g., time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry\n(ToF-AMS) and extractive electrospray ionization (EESI)-ToF MS, provide\nOA composition with very high time-resolution at both bulk and molecular\nlevels for nontrace ambient concentrations.\n−\n\n Other online\nmass spectrometers can also characterize low ambient OA concentrations\nat longer time intervals (e.g., FIGAERO–CIMS). Despite these benefits, the application of online mass\nspectrometers for long-term air quality studies is severely restricted\nby high logistical and maintenance costs in many resource-limited\nurban and rural locations around the world. Offline techniques\n(e.g., liquid chromatography (LC)-ToF, LC-Orbitrap,\nlaser desorption ionization-ToF, two-dimensional gas chromatography-ToF,\nFIGAERO-EESI-MS, among others) overcome these issues by measuring\nthe composition of ambient OA sampled on quartz or Teflon filters\nin a laboratory.\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The samples can be collected using high or low volume samplers that\ncan be easily transported and installed in different locations. Offline\nmethods considerably expand the regions where OA composition can be\ninvestigated cost-effectively via state-of-the-art mass spectrometry.\nFilter sample extracts in organic solvents (e.g., methanol, acetone,\nacetonitrile) are mostly analyzed via soft-ionization-based analytical\ntechniques. However, the detailed chemical information obtained from\nsoft-ionization-based, nontargeted offline analyses is often difficult\nto quantify due to measurement uncertainties originating from sample\npreparation, relative differences in analyte sensitivity to ionization\nschemes, and the unavailability of calibration standards. The\nmore recently developed offline-AMS (Off-AMS) technique has\npermitted quantifiable measurements of ambient OA in laboratory conditions.\n−\n\n\n These measurements can be applied to source apportionment algorithms\n(e.g., positive matrix factorization) to quantify the contributions\nof OA sources. However, Off-AMS typically uses Milli-Q water for sample\nextraction, and filters extracted in organic solvents have been rarely\nmeasured via AMS.\n,\n This limits the analysis to the\nwater-soluble fraction of OA (WSOA) that is largely constituted by\nSOA. Depending on the environment, sources, and seasons, WSOA can\nrange from 15 to 80% of ambient OA.\n−\n\n\n It is often low during winter\nin regions with complex emission portfolios dominated by combustion-based\nsources, e.g., motor vehicles and solid-fuel burning, where WSOA may\nconstitute less than 50% of the total OA mass. Consequently, source\napportionment analyses based on Off-AMS measurements can mainly identify\nsources that are fully or at least somewhat water-soluble. The sources\nof POA and non-WSOA must be estimated either via empirical methods\nor corrected for with substantial uncertainties. Such corrections\ncan introduce additional uncertainties in analyses and source apportionment\noutcomes.\n,, Here,\nwe present a new analytical approach to overcome these challenges\nby coupling Off-AMS with filter samples extracted in organic solvents\n(hereon SOff-AMS). Via analyzing ambient samples collected from different\nenvironments, we demonstrate that (i) SOff-AMS substantially increases\nthe extractable fraction of organic carbon that is quantitatively\nanalyzed constraining both primary (e.g., fossil-fuel combustion)\nand secondary (e.g., oxygenated organic aerosol) sources; (ii) the\nSOff-AMS-based OA spectra compare well with online measurements suggesting\nthat online-level characterization can be achieved offline with this\ntechnique, and; (iii) water-insoluble coarse OA fraction of ambient\nPM can also be quantitatively characterized via this technique, which\nhas traditionally been challenging to study via both online and offline\nmethods. Overall, SOff-AMS is a powerful offline technique to comprehensively\ncharacterize ambient OA. It can considerably expand the reach of atmospheric\nchemistry studies to diverse urban and rural locations worldwide,\nwhere online measurements with advanced mass spectrometers are usually\nnot feasible."

      "text": "A total of 8 multiseason\nfilter samples were collected for these tests in Magadino (Switzerland)\nand Krakow (Poland). In Magadino, PM2.5 and PM10 samples were collected on 1 January 2019 and 27 June 2018 at the\nMagadino-Cadenazzo site (part of the Swiss National Air Pollution\nMonitoring Network – NABEL), while in Krakow, PM1 and PM10 samples were collected on 26 January 2018 and\n27 June 2018 on the roof of the Physics and Applied Computer Science\nFaculty of the AGH University building (20 m.a.g.). Some additional\n24 h fine PM filters were also collected on other days for different\npurposes; here, only the water-soluble organic carbon and total organic\ncarbon analyses are used (performed with the same protocols as for\nsamples in this study, details below). The sampling occurred on quartz\nfilters using high volume samplers at a nominal flow rate of 0.5 m3 min–1 for 24 h each (00–23.59 h). SOff-AMS builds\non prior Off-AMS work by replacing Milli-Q water with organic solvents\nfor sample extraction.\n,\n High-purity acetone (Sigma-Aldrich,\nCAS:67–64–1; ≥99.8% purity) and ultrahigh-purity\nmethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS:67–56–1; ≥99.92%\npurity) were used for this purpose. These solvents were selected since\ntheir use for preparing filter sample extracts is well-documented\nin previous studies.\n,,−\n\n\n\n\n Filter samples extracted in ultrapure Milli-Q water were also measured\nfor reference. In total, 24 sample extracts were prepared including\nboth sites -8 in acetone, 8 in methanol, and 8 in water. The Krakow\nwinter samples were extracted using 4 punches of 16 mm diameter per\nextract, while the remaining samples were extracted using 5 punches\nper extract. The punches were dissolved in 20 mL of organic solvent\nor Milli-Q water in a glass vial by sonicating for 20 min at 30 °C,\nfollowed by vortex treatment for 1 min. Subsequently, the vortexed\nextracts in organic solvents were filtered using PTFE syringe filters\n(Infochroma; product # 8813Y-P4̅; pore size:\n0.45 μm) attached to a glass syringe (SOCOREX Dosys # 155.0310).\nThe glass syringes and PTFE filters were replaced with PTFE syringes\nand nylon filters (Infochroma; product # 8813Y–N-4; pore size:\n0.45 μm) for water extracts to be consistent with the prior\nwater-based extraction procedure. All\nfilter extracts were spiked with 250 μL of 200 ppm of isotopically\nlabeled ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate solution (15NH4\n15NO3, (15NH4)2\n34SO4) used as internal standard.\nThe glass vials and glass syringes were extensively rinsed prior to\nuse with Milli-Q water, followed by HPLC-grade acetone and methanol,\nand heated at 100 °C in a furnace for 14 h to eliminate background\ncontamination. The PTFE syringes were rinsed with 120 mL of Milli-Q\nwater prior to use but were not heat-treated. The PTFE filters were\nrinsed with ∼100 mL of sample extraction solvent. Filter blanks\nand pure solvents spiked with the internal standard were also measured\nfollowing the same protocols. The extracts were nebulized using\nsynthetic air via a microflow nebulizer (Apex 2.0; Elemental Scientific\nInc.) at a flow rate of 0.7 slpm into a cyclonic spray chamber. The\nchamber was maintained at 60 °C for water extracts and at 25\n°C for methanol and acetone extracts to achieve a stable AMS\nsignal during measurements. The excess solvent was condensed out by\na Peltier-cooled condenser maintained at 2 °C and evacuated using\nan inbuilt peristaltic pump in the nebulizer. For water extracts,\na Nafion dryer (Perma Pure LLC) was additionally installed downstream\nof the nebulizer. The sample spray was diluted with 2.1 slpm, 2.8\nslpm, and 5 slpm of clean airflow for water, methanol, and acetone\nextracts, respectively. The dilution ratios were established following\nseveral trials to optimize the stability of the AMS signal during\nsample measurements. The resulting aerosols were measured via a high-resolution\nlong-time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (LToF-AMS) (Aerodyne\nResearch Inc.). The operating principles of the AMS instrument are\ndescribed in detail by DeCarlo et al., and the offline protocols are thoroughly discussed elsewhere.\n,, Two sets of stainless-steel\ntransfer lines were used between the\nnebulizer and the AMS, one set reserved for organic solvents and the\nother for water extracts. These steps were taken to avoid cross-contamination\nbetween solvents- and water-based measurements and to maintain a clean\nbackground. Samples extracted in different solvents were analyzed\nin separate batches. The transfer lines were flushed thoroughly for\nseveral hours before switching between the batches. The analysis sequence\nbegan by measuring spiked solvent, followed by extracts (Figure \n, filter blanks were\nmeasured following the same sequence). During analysis, a 6-to-8 min\nsolvent flush was performed between samples to eliminate potential\nmemory effects and ensure a low background signal between sample runs.\nDepending on the solvent, OA of the least polluted sample measured\nby the AMS in this study (i.e., summertime Magadino PM2.5) exceeded spiked solvent blank by a factor of 5–12 and by\n21–25 for the more polluted winter samples (Figure \n). The AMS data were analyzed\nusing Squirrel (v1.64) and Pika (v1.24) modules on the IGOR Pro software\nplatform (Wavemetrics, Inc., Portland, OR). The high-resolution ion\nfragments were fitted to peaks between m/z 12 and 150 in each mass spectrum. The signals beyond m/z 150 were analyzed at unit mass resolution\n(UMR). Finally, the two sections of the mass spectra were combined\nto obtain a complete organic mass spectrum. For the samples from Krakow,\nthe OA spectra from SOff-AMS were also compared with data collected\nfrom a colocated online Q-ACSM (PM1 inlet, standard vaporizer,\nAerodyne Research Inc.), averaged over a 24 h period corresponding\nto the filter collection date. This allowed\nus to assess the effectiveness of SOff-AMS in replicating real-time\ncharacterization of ambient OA. In addition, the least and most polluted\nsamples used in this study (i.e., summertime Magadino PM2.5 and wintertime Krakow PM10, respectively) were stored\nin the dark at 4 °C and remeasured after 36 h to check for stability\nin aerosol spectra. Example timeseries of HROrg, HRNO3, and HRSO4 of filter samples extracted in (a) methanol, (b) acetone,\nand (c)\nwater during SOff-AMS measurements. The labels 1–4 indicate\nsummer ambient samples including Magadino: (1) PM2.5 and\n(3) PM10, and Krakow: (2) PM1 and (4) PM10. Winter samples included Magadino: (5) PM2.5 and\n(6) PM10, and Krakow: (7) PM1 and (8) PM10. The sampling order (1–8) in (a) methanol tests is\nreplicated in (b) acetone and (c) water measurements. The combined organic\nAMS spectrum (HR m/z 12–150\nand UMR m/z 151–467) extracted\nfrom samples was directly quantified from AMS measurements using eq \n, which is discussed in\ndetail by Casotto et al.\n1OAAMS,i,m/z(μgm−3)=IAMS,i,m/zRIEorg*c.1Ii,15NO3·MIS·AAp·1VaHere, OAams,i,m/z\n is the organic aerosol concentration in μg\nm–3 of an ion in question (m/z) for a sample or blank “i”.

A is the total filter area used in sample collection, A\np is the filter area punched for sample extraction,\nand V\na is the total volume of air sampled\nduring filter collection. For all filter samples, ion concentrations\ncalculated via eq \n were\nfilter background-corrected prior to further analysis using a pure\nsolvent measurement that was spiked with an internal standard. Returning to eq \n, RIEorg is the default literature relative ionization efficiency\nof organics in the AMS taken 1.4. However, the AMS used in the present\nstudy operated with an usually high RIE for organics, represented\nhere as the product of RIEorg and the correction factor\n“c” (this formulation is chosen to\nemphasize that the organic RIE estimated herein represents the unusual\nperformance of the specific instrument used and should not be held\ngenerally true for all AMS instruments). To estimate c, we assumed that the RIE of organics is equal to the RIE of levoglucosan.\nPrevious studies have shown the RIE of levoglucosan to be 1.4–1.8\nfor AMS and 1.27–1.4 for ACSM, which is consistent with the\ntypical organics RIE of 1.4.\n,\n This allowed us to\ncalibrate for deviations in our AMS instrument relative to others.\nWe determined c to be 1.86 ± 0.1, as shown later in Figure \na. (a) Calibration curves\nfor levoglucosan prepared in acetone, methanol,\nand water. (b–d) AMS spectra of levoglucosan OA aerosolized\nin (b) methanol, (c) acetone, and (d) water. Note: Panel (a) shows\nslope-adjusted linearity in instrument response to levoglucosan with\na calculated average correction factor of 1.86. The measurement errors after background correction\nwere propagated\nbased on eq \n using the\nstandard deviation in spectra recorded over the measurement period\nof a filter sample (σOA,i,m/z\n) and spiked solvent blank (σOA,B,m/z\n), processed with eq \n\n3σOAAMS,i,m/z(μgm−3)=(σOAAMS,i,m/z)2+(σOAAMS,B,m/z)2 The OA concentration was calculated\nas the sum of all organic aerosol\nfragments4OAAMS,i(μgm−3)=∑m/zOAAMS,i,m/z To compare to reference measurements,\nwe further calculated the\nOC concentration as the sum of all organic aerosol ions divided by\nthe bulk organic matter-to-organic carbon ratio (OM/OC). OM/OC was\ncalculated using the improved-ambient method based on Canagaratna\net al. implemented in the analytic procedure for elemental separation (APES) v1.09 module built on the IGOR Pro software platform.\n5OCAMS,i(μgm−3)=∑m/zOAAMS,i,m/z(OM/OC)i We proceeded analogously for inorganic\nconstituents. Nitrate was\nquantified using the total AMS signal of 14NO+ and 14NO2\n+ ions instead of I\nAMS,m/z\n, and\nsimilarly 32SO+ and 32SO2\n+ and their isotopically labeled counterparts (34SO+ and 34SO2\n+) were\nused for sulfate. Since the RIE for the pairs 14NO3 – 15NO3 and 32SO4 – 34SO4 can be assumed to be\nthe same, the RIE term was omitted from the equation. The WSOC content in the filter samples was\nmeasured with a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer (TOC-LCPH; Shimadzu), extracted analogously to those for AMS analyses. The\norganic carbon constituents were oxidized to CO2 using\nhydrochloric acid and measured using a “680 °C combustion\ncatalytic oxidation with nondispersive infrared (NDIR) detection”\ntechnique. Given the nature of the solvent, no analogous analyses\ncould be performed for methanol and acetone extracts. In addition,\nthe total organic carbon (OCtotal) and elemental carbon\n(EC) content of filter samples was measured via the thermo-optical\ntransmittance (TOT) method, using a Lab OC-EC Aerosol Analyzer (Model\n5 L, Sunset Laboratory Inc.) and adhering to the EUSAAR-2 protocol.\nQuartz filter samples undergo heating up to 650 °C in a helium-rich\natmosphere initially, followed by further heating up to 850 °C\nin a mixture of 2% oxygen gas in helium, using the controlled heating\nramps specified in the EUSAAR-2 thermal protocol. During this process, OC evolves in the inert atmosphere,\nwhile EC undergoes oxidation in the helium–oxygen atmosphere.\nCharring correction is implemented by monitoring the sample transmittance\nthroughout the heating process. The limit of detection (LOD) for TOT\nanalysis was 0.02 μg m–3 of carbon. The field\nblanks were prepared and processed following identical procedures.\nFor optimal comparability between the samples, all samples were measured\non the same day in the same laboratory. The uncertainty is calculated\nat 15% for OC and 23% for EC and takes into account the limits of\ndetection, reproducibility, repeatability, and precision based on\nreferences, the detector sensitivity uncertainty, and the area uncertainty\nof the filter."

Since the RIE for the pairs 14NO3 – 15NO3 and 32SO4 – 34SO4 can be assumed to be\nthe same, the RIE term was omitted from the equation."

      "text": "Five-point calibrations were performed for all solvents using mixes\nprepared with levoglucosan and inorganic standards (ammonium nitrate\nand ammonium sulfate) (Figures \n and S1). The mixes were spiked\nwith the internal standard, nebulized, and measured using the same\nmethod as for sample extracts. The calibration slopes showed 80–90%\nrecovery of the injected concentrations for inorganic standards. The\nslope of the levoglucosan calibration was used to determine the corrected\norganic RIE (RIEorg * c) as discussed\npreviously (this correction is already applied in Figure \na, yielding data in good agreement\nwith the 1:1 line). With the corrected RIE applied, OCams compared well with the reference OC measured\nusing the TOC analyzer. The solvent background-subtracted levoglucosan\nspectra were strongly similar across solvents (cosine angles: 9–13°)\nwith strong signals at characteristic m/z 60 and 73 contributed by C2H4O2\n+ and C3H5O2\n+ fragments (Figure \n).\n,\n Ion intensities of small molecular weight\nfragments (<m/z 80) including\nC\nx\nH\ny\n and other\noxygenated ions that formed majority of the total spectra were also\ncomparable between all solvents (Figure S2). Some differences were observed beyond m/z > 80; larger C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments were more prominent in methanol and acetone\nextracts relative to water, while oxygenated ions showed higher signal\nin water relative to acetone and were comparable in methanol. These\nions constituted less than 1% of the total spectra. Artifacts introduced\nby imperfect solvent background subtractions were evaluated by comparing\nthe resulting levoglucosan mass spectra to a best-estimate spectrum.\nThe best-estimate spectrum was calculated as the average spectrum\nof the three solvents for the highest levoglucosan concentration (6\nμg mL–1). For each fragment ion, data from\nsolvents exhibiting background subtraction imperfections, such as\nresidual solvent signals at low levoglucosan concentrations, were\nexcluded. Thereby, we found that mainly fragment ions that are major\ncontributors to the solvent background were affected in the levoglucosan\nmass spectrum (Figures S3 and S4), with\nspecific influences from acetone (C2H3O+- and CO2-related peaks), methanol (CH3O+), and water (CO2\n+). However,\nthese effects had only a minor impact on the OM/OC ratio (within 4%\nof the best-estimate value: Figure S5)\nand the determined mass concentration (within 10% of the true concentration: Figure S6). Furthermore, we also investigated\nsolvent removal from four mixtures containing different concentrations\nof inorganic standards (2–5 μg mL–1 NH4\n14NO3; 2.5 μg mL–1 NH4\n15NO3; 2–5 μg mL–1 NH4\n32SO4; 2.5 μg\nmL–1 NH4\n34SO4)\nthat showed no considerable change in organic aerosol detected by\nthe AMS (∑\nm/z\n\nI\nAMS,i,m/z\n)\nwith increasing salt concentrations (Figure S7). The levels of OCams for spiked solvent procedural\nblanks\nwere 1.4 μg mL–1 (29 μg) in acetone,\n0.6 μg mL–1 (11 μg) in methanol, and\n0.2 μg mL–1 (4.9 μg) in water. Based\non these analyses, we estimate the procedural limits of detection\n(LoDSB, defined here as 3 standard deviations of the spiked\nsolvent procedural blank) of OCams were 0.8 μg mL–1 (16 μg) in acetone, 0.15 μg mL–1 (3 μg) in methanol, and 0.2 μg mL–1 (4 μg) in water. Without solvent background subtraction, the\nmeasured OCams of filter blanks (FB) were comparable for\nmethanol (0.6 μg mL–1:11 μg) and 1.7\ntimes higher for acetone (2.5 μg mL–1: 50\nμg) and 1.5 times higher for water (0.3 μg mL–1: 7 μg). Thus, the procedural blanks dominated the OCams measured for the filter blanks. The LoDFB of OCams was defined here as 3 standard deviations of the filter blank analyses,\ni.e., it describes the minimum amount of OCams required\nfrom an atmospheric aerosol filter sample. LoDFB was 1.3\nμg mL–1 (26 μg) in acetone, 0.03 μg\nmL–1 (0.6 μg) in methanol, and 0.05 μg\nmL–1 (1 μg) in water. These were substantially\nlower than the sample with the lowest solvent background-subtracted\nOCams (PM2.5 Magadino summer) with 3.9 μg\nmL–1 (78 μg) in acetone, 4.2 μg mL–1 (83 μg) in methanol, and 3.4 μg mL–1 (68 μg) in water. Each solvent showed\na distinct mass spectrum dominated by its own\nfragments. While C2H3O+ and C3H6O+ were prominent in acetone spectra\nalongside some C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments, methanol spectra showed strong prevalence of CH3O+, CH4O+, and CHO+ ions (Figure S8). Several C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments were commonly\nobserved in acetone, methanol, and water indicating contamination\nartifacts, though minor. The spectra of filter blank extracts prior\nto solvent background subtraction were also very similar to spiked\nsolvents (Figure S9). These factors further\nsupport that the filter material had a minor influence on the measurement\nbackground, which mainly originated from impurities in solvents or\nthe experimental setup. Henceforth, all analyses are filter blank\ncorrected unless stated otherwise. Methanol is frequently used for\nsample extractions in other analytical techniques and is shown to\nextract diverse chemical species given a midrange polarity index of\n0.7.\n,,\n It also has\nconsiderably lower vapor pressure than acetone (boiling points: 64.7\n°C methanol vs 56 °C acetone) that prevents samples from\nuncontrolled concentrating via solvent evaporation prior to being\nnebulized into the spray chamber. For these reasons, we focus the\ndiscussion on methanol while providing analogous comparisons for acetone-\nand water-based measurements. The bulk OC solubility was measured directly from the AMS for all\nsolvent extracts as OCams using eq \n and also via the nonpurgeable organic carbon\n(NPOC) analysis of water extracts. All summer and Magadino winter\nwater extracts showed high NPOC content, while Krakow winter samples\nwere less soluble (Figure \n). Overall, the water solubilities of samples analyzed in\nthis study were largely representative of other days in the same season\nfor each site (Figures \n and S10). Furthermore, while the OC solubility\nin wintertime Krakow was lower than in other regions in Europe, mainly\ndue to high coal combustion for residential heating, the solubilities\nof summertime Krakow and all Magadino samples were comparable to other\nEuropean sites.\n−\n\n The contributions of dominant OA sources in Krakow\nand Magadino, i.e., HOA, solid-fuel combustion-related primary OA,\nand oxygenated OA, were also similar to other European locations (Figure S11). Thus, the samples investigated in\nthis study represented typical OA source profiles and bulk OA water\nsolubility across Europe and likely also to other regions, e.g., Asia.\n,, Fractions of organic carbon extracted\nfrom filter samples in acetone\n(red), methanol (blue), and water (light green) extracts measured\nvia SOff-AMS. The NPOC fraction in water extracts is also shown (dark\ngreen). Black star markers indicate season-based slopes of WSOC vs\nOC distributions for all fine PM samples collected in Krakow and Magadino\n(Figure S10). On the x-axis, the samples are labeled denoting sites, particle sizes, and\nseasons in which the samples were collected. “MGD” (Magadino)\nand “KRK” (Krakow) are sampling locations. PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 are particle sizes, and “S”\nand “W” indicate summer and winter seasons. OCams for water extracts showed a comparable\ntrend to\nthat of NPOC, but all summer samples exceeded corresponding NPOC values.\nThe uncertainties in organic mass-to-organic carbon ratios (OM/OC)\nand field blank subtractions at low summer concentrations or loss\nof purgeable inorganic carbon (e.g., carbonates) during acid dissolution\nof sample extracts in NPOC analyses could explain the higher OCams. In general, OC was more soluble in organic solvents compared\nto water (OCams,os/OCams,w) (Figure \n). OCams,os/OCams,w ranged 1.1–4.2 for methanol and 1–5.2 for\nacetone extracts. For both sites, the ratio strongly varied between\nseasons and particle sizes. For fine OA, winter OCams,os/OCams,w (2.9 ± 1.6) was a factor of 2.5 higher than\nsummer (1.2 ± 0.2). For PM10 OA, the ratio increased\nto 3.3 ± 1.5 for winter and 1.3 ± 0.2 for summer samples.\nThe wintertime OC dissolved more in organic solvents, likely due to\nincreased contributions from hydrocarbon-like or other fresh aerosols.\nThis is further evidenced by a high fraction of elemental carbon in\nwinter samples (16–20%), suggesting major contributions from\ncombustion-based nonwater-soluble emissions (Figure S12). Coal combustion POA is an important source in Krakow\nduring winter that contributed 12% to fine OA, alongside 3% from biomass\nburning POA. The OC solubility of Krakow\nsamples enhanced by a factor of 2.8–3.2 in organic solvents\nrelative to water, suggesting substantially increased dissolution\nof coal combustion-related OA. Coal combustion did not contribute\nsignificantly to POA in Magadino, although biomass burning is an important\nsource.\n, The OC solubilities also varied between\nmethanol and acetone extracts.\nFor all winter samples, 53–57% of OCtotal was soluble\nin methanol exceeding 14–40% in water. The solubility increased\nfurther in acetone (67–91%) compared to methanol due to increased\ndissolution of nonpolar OA constituents. The relatively consistent\nsolubility of winter samples in methanol could be attributed to its\nmidscale polarity, permitting the extraction of diverse chemical species.\nAcetone and water have more separated polarities potentially causing\ndissolution of varying fractions of organic mass strongly depending\non OA composition. In comparison, summer samples showed high OC solubilities\nin all solvents including (70–95%) water, (80–120%)\nmethanol, and (80–130%) acetone due to greater oxygenation\nof constituting organic compounds. Overall, the bulk OC measurements\ndemonstrated that SOff-AMS can significantly enhance the OC mass fraction\nthat can be analyzed offline from filters, especially during wintertime\nconditions. The OA spectra differed between sites and seasons\ndepending on influencing factors including differences in precursor\nemissions, environmental conditions, ambient OA levels, and their\nsolubility in the extraction solvent. The spectra of OA extracted\nin organic solvents captured these differences more effectively than\nwater extracts since several mass fragment groups were relatively\nenhanced. The methanol and acetone extracts of winter OA were dominated\nby C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments\nthat constituted over 50% of the HR spectra with smaller contributions\nfrom oxygenated species (36–40%) (Figures S13 and 14). In contrast, only ∼30% of each spectrum\nfrom water extracts was constituted by C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments. For each winter sample,\nextracts in organic solvents produced largely comparable spectra that\nwere dissimilar to water extracts (cosine: 35–50°). In\nthe UMR region spanning m/z 151–467,\nwintertime OA spectra were substantially enhanced in organic solvents\n(Figures \n and S15). The UMR signal constituted 25–28%\n(methanol) and 27–30% (acetone) of the winter OA spectra in\nKrakow, which reduced to 6–7% in water extracts. For Magadino\nwinter, this fraction reduced to 11% in both methanol and acetone\nand was 7% in water extracts (Figure S13). The Magadino HR spectra were comparable across solvents. However,\nmethanol extracts were slightly more similar to water than acetone\n(<15 vs <20°). Overall, these observations indicated lower\nwater-insoluble primary source contributions (coal combustion and\ntraffic exhaust) in Magadino than in Krakow during winter. Enhanced contributions\nin methanol-SOff-AMS measurements relative\nto water-Off-AMS of key ions to (a) fine (PM1 and PM2.5), (b) PM10, and (c) coarse PM spectra from summertime\n(yellow) and wintertime (blue) Krakow and Magadino. More broadly, over all sites and seasons, oxygenated\nfragments\nconstituted 60 ± 2% of the HR spectra from water extracts, and\ntheir OM/OC ratio also remained stable (2.03 ± 0.05). Acetone\nextracts attributed 48 ± 5% to C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments, and the OM/OC was considerably\nlower across seasons and sites (1.6 ± 0.09) (Figure S16). Thus, acetone- and water-based sample extractions\nindicated a certain solubility bias that would benefit a more targeted\nanalysis of select OA constituents. On the other hand, methanol extracts\ncaptured variations in OA composition over a broader range of C\nx\nH\ny\n (37–54%),\noxygenated fragments (41 – 58%), and OM/OC (1.8 ± 0.14). Several key ions were also enhanced in organic solvents (Figures \n and S17–S19). The small hydrocarbon fragments\nincluding C2H3\n+, C2H5\n+, C3H5\n+, C3H7\n+, C4H7\n+, C4H9\n+, C5H7\n+, C5H9\n+, and\nC5H11\n+ increased by a factor of 1.5–60\nin spectra from both Krakow and Magadino. The oxygenated fragments\n(e.g., C2H4O2\n+, C2H5O2\n+, among others) were\ncomparatively less yet clearly enhanced (1.2–2.7). Within each\ncategory of fragment species (e.g., C\nx\nH\ny\n, C\nx\nH\ny\nO\nz\n), higher molecular\nweight ions showed greater enhancement than smaller ones, likely due\nto higher hydrophobicity and increased solubility of larger-molecular-weight\nspecies from hydrocarbon-like OA. However, reduced nitrogen-containing\nfragments exhibited a mixed behavior. C3H8N+ and C3H9N+ that are known\ntracers of cigarette smoke increased considerably (1.5–6),\nwhile CHN+ and CH4N+ were comparable\nin methanol and water but reduced in acetone extracts. Similarly,\nsulfur-containing fragments −CHSO+ and CH3SO2\n+ were reduced by 1–2 orders of magnitude\nin organic solvents (Figures \n, S17 and S18). Consequently, it\nmay be more difficult with SOff-AMS to apportion sources traced via\nthese fragments (e.g., methanesulfonic acid; marine SOA), yet possible\nwith clean backgrounds and application of other potential markers\nthat might be enhanced. The signal enhancement with molecular\nweight was also observed\nin the UMR region of the spectra, which was dominated by PAHs. The\nsignal increased consistently from m/z 128 (4–5) to 252 (40–60) for winter OA in organic\nsolvents. Acetone extracts showed slightly higher ion signal than\nmethanol in this mass range due to lower polarity.\n,\n Summer samples also showed a similar trend for all fragment categories\nbut with weaker enhancement relative to winter (Figures \n and S17), likely\ndue to reduced contributions from PAHs. The magnitude and composition\nof coarse PM were calculated as the\ndifference between the spectra of PM10 and fine PM. While\nOCcoarse was within the measurement error of OCfine for the winter samples indicating minimal to no coarse contributions,\nsignificant coarse OC was observed during summer (Krakow: 1.5 μg/m3, Magadino: 0.3 μg/m3 in methanol extracts).\nThus, we focus the discussion on summertime coarse OA (Figures \nc and S17). At both locations, mainly select hydrocarbon fragments\nwere considerably enhanced in methanol and acetone extracts relative\nto water, with a stronger increase for saturated (C4H9\n+, C5H11\n+, C3H7\n+) than for unsaturated fragments\n(C4H7\n+, C5H9\n+). The enhancement in acetone was a factor of 3–5\nhigher than in methanol. Consequently, observations over a larger\nsample size can likely differentiate sources of coarse PM between\ndifferent measurement locations. The limitations of using water\nas an extraction solvent are clear\nfor winter OA, which produced very similar spectra for Krakow and\nMagadino despite differences in sources between the sites (Figures S13d, S20, and S21). Water extracts summertime OA more effectively than winter, which\nis also evidenced by their increased OC solubility (Figure \n). For these samples, the HR\nspectra (i.e., m/z ≤ 150) constituted >95%\nof the OA mass across all solvent extracts, 50–60% of which\nwere contributed by oxygenated fragments (C\nx\nH\ny\nO and C\nx\nH\ny\nO>1). We\nalso compared our offline analyses of Krakow fine OA with measurements\nfrom a colocated online Q-ACSM that can be considered real-time characterization\nfor our purposes in this study. The SOff-AMS\nspectra were integrated to unit mass resolution and renormalized after\nexcluding large ions (m/z 126–467)\nsince the Q-ACSM measured only up to m/z 125. This comparison should be treated with caution due to differences\nbetween AMS and Q-ACSM instruments. First, the longer sample/background\nswitching interval of Q-ACSM instruments increases the importance\nof slow vaporization processes in the mass spectrum, which can enhance\nthe contributions of ions such as m/z 44. Comparison of m/z > ∼100 should also be treated with\ncaution\ndue to the uncertainty in estimated m/z transmission function of the Q-ACSM, which may cause systematic\nunder/overestimation of ions at high m/z relative to low m/z. Different\nsampling cutoff sizes (AMS: PM2.5 vs Q-ACSM: PM1) could also potentially affect the OA spectra, though minimal under\npolluted conditions. Therefore, the Q-ACSM\nspectrum should not be considered a “gold standard”\ncomparison for SOff-AMS data; nonetheless, comparison remains instructive. The methanol extract and Q-ACSM spectra were highly comparable\nduring winter (cosine: 16–17°) with similar fractions\nof total signal at m/z 44 (f44: 0.03 vs ACSM: 0.06), 43 (f43: 0.05 vs 0.08),\nand 60 (f60: 0.01 vs 0.01) (Figure \na). The acetone and water extracts were slightly\nless comparable, though not entirely dissimilar (cosine: acetone 21°,\nwater 23°) (Figures S22–S24). Comparisons of the (a) wintertime and (b) summertime Krakow PM1 OA spectra analyzed via SOff-AMS of methanol sample extract\nin the laboratory vs directly measured on site using a Q-ACSM. The\nOA spectra of Krakow PM1 samples measured in the laboratory\nfrom methanol and water-based sample extractions are compared for\n(c) winter- and (d) summertime conditions. Summertime ACSM spectra were similar to the water\nextract (cosine:\n18–22°), while methanol (28–30°) and acetone\nextracts (cosine > 40°) were considerably dissimilar (Figures \nd and S22 and 23). The similarity with water extract\nwas strongly influenced by high signals at m/z 28 and 44 in ACSM spectra during summer. Upon excluding\nthese ions (and the derived fragment ions 16, 17, 18), the ACSM spectra\ncompared similarly to water (22–28°) as to methanol (22–24°)\nand acetone extracts (∼29°). We showed that SOff-AMS can characterize significantly larger mass\nfraction of wintertime OA with substantial primary- and less-aged\nsource contributions in comparison to water extracts. Furthermore,\nthe SOff-AMS spectra can replicate real-time measurements of ambient\nOA, demonstrating that characterization close to online-level can\nbe achieved in offline laboratory-based measurements. Despite potential\nartifacts from sampling, incomplete solubility, and solvent interactions,\nthe strong agreement between SOff-AMS and Q-ACSM measurements supports\nthe reliability of SOff-AMS for OA characterization. The repeat analyses\nafter 36 h also confirmed the stability of OA spectra in solvent extracts\n(Figure S25). Nevertheless, large-scale\nintercomparisons will be important to further evaluate its performance\nacross diverse environments, sampling, and analysis periods. SOff-AMS\nenhanced the detection of several key markers of anthropogenic and\nbiogenic sources in OA spectra, which can be coupled with source apportionment\ntechniques to constrain sources of fresh ambient OA as well as other\nminor sources. For example, methanol extracts of Krakow winter OA\nnot only showed markedly higher small hydrocarbon contributions relative\nto water extracts but also a substantially higher concentration of\nfragments typically related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs:\n128, 152, 165, 178, 189, 202, 215, 226, 239, 252, and 276) (Figures \n and S15).\n,\n This is consistent\nwith Krakow being strongly affected by fresh and only slightly aged\nresidential coal combustion and wood burning emissions. Wood is the\ndominant solid fuel in wintertime Magadino, so the impact of hydrocarbons\nand PAHs was expectedly smaller (Figure \n) since wood burning emits less PAHs than\ncoal combustion.\n,\n This differentiation is crucial\nfor constraining the relative importance of sources in Krakow, Magadino,\nand other areas that are impacted by fresh combustion and other nonwater-soluble\nemissions.\n, Mass spectra of wintertime fine OA from\nKrakow and Magadino measured\nvia (a) methanol-SOff-AMS and (b) water-Off-AMS. Each spectrum combines\nhigh-resolution (≤m/z 150,\ncolored) and UMR (>m/z 152, black)\nion signals stacked on integer m/z values. (c, d) UMR spectra comparing the prevalence of higher molecular\nweight fragments in wintertime PM10 OA between Krakow and\nMagadino measured via (c) methanol-SOff-AMS and (d) water-Off-AMS.\nThe pie charts (inset c, d) show the fraction of extracted aerosol\nmass of PM10 for m/z ≤ 150 and m/z > 150. In the absence of a detectable amount of OCcoarse in\nwinter, we focused on the chemical composition of summertime coarse\nOA (Figures \n and S26). In general, acetone extracted a higher\nfraction (60–100%) than methanol and water extracts (35–49%)\nof the OCcoarse measured directly with the Sunset OC analyzer.\nPrevious work based on water extracts has established that AMS fingerprints\nof primary biological organic aerosol such as pollen and fungal spores\nexhibit characteristic peaks C2H5O2\n+ and C2H4O2\n+ with approximately similar intensity in the aerosol spectra. We\nfound this pattern in coarse OA from summertime Krakow and Magadino\nin both methanol and water extracts, however, with different C2H5O2\n+/C2H4O2\n+ ratios. Overall, the spectra showed\nclear differences between the extracts, as shown in Figure \n. Negative peaks at CH2O+, CH3O+, and CH4O+ for methanol extracts are the dominant peaks in solvent\nblanks and are removed due to their high uncertainty. The coarse OA\nspectra from water extracts were characterized by a higher prevalence\nof oxygenated fragments relative to methanol extracts that showed\na stronger presence of C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments. This suggests that SOff-AMS can characterize\nprimary coarse OA to potentially constrain both natural and anthropogenic\nsources (e.g., plastics). Summertime high-resolution mass spectra of coarse\nOA from Krakow\nand Magadino extracted in (a) methanol and (c) water. (b–d)\nComparisons between normalized mass spectra of coarse OA from (b)\nKrakow and (d) Magadino extracted in methanol and water.

In summary, SOff-AMS is a transferable analytical\nprotocol that\ncan be widely used to comprehensively characterize ambient OA from\ndiverse areas including where in situ online measurements may not\nbe feasible due to cost and logistical considerations. It can also\nhelp investigate the composition and sources of coarse and other larger\nparticles that are typically not accessible via online AMS measurements."

Furthermore, we also investigated\nsolvent removal from four mixtures containing different concentrations\nof inorganic standards (2–5 μg mL–1 NH4\n14NO3; 2.5 μg mL–1 NH4\n15NO3; 2–5 μg mL–1 NH4\n32SO4; 2.5 μg\nmL–1 NH4\n34SO4)\nthat showed no considerable change in organic aerosol detected by\nthe AMS (∑\nm/z\n\nI\nAMS,i,m/z\n)\nwith increasing salt concentrations (Figure S7). The levels of OCams for spiked solvent procedural\nblanks\nwere 1.4 μg mL–1 (29 μg) in acetone,\n0.6 μg mL–1 (11 μg) in methanol, and\n0.2 μg mL–1 (4.9 μg) in water. Based\non these analyses, we estimate the procedural limits of detection\n(LoDSB, defined here as 3 standard deviations of the spiked\nsolvent procedural blank) of OCams were 0.8 μg mL–1 (16 μg) in acetone, 0.15 μg mL–1 (3 μg) in methanol, and 0.2 μg mL–1 (4 μg) in water. Without solvent background subtraction, the\nmeasured OCams of filter blanks (FB) were comparable for\nmethanol (0.6 μg mL–1:11 μg) and 1.7\ntimes higher for acetone (2.5 μg mL–1: 50\nμg) and 1.5 times higher for water (0.3 μg mL–1: 7 μg). Thus, the procedural blanks dominated the OCams measured for the filter blanks. The LoDFB of OCams was defined here as 3 standard deviations of the filter blank analyses,\ni.e., it describes the minimum amount of OCams required\nfrom an atmospheric aerosol filter sample. LoDFB was 1.3\nμg mL–1 (26 μg) in acetone, 0.03 μg\nmL–1 (0.6 μg) in methanol, and 0.05 μg\nmL–1 (1 μg) in water. These were substantially\nlower than the sample with the lowest solvent background-subtracted\nOCams (PM2.5 Magadino summer) with 3.9 μg\nmL–1 (78 μg) in acetone, 4.2 μg mL–1 (83 μg) in methanol, and 3.4 μg mL–1 (68 μg) in water. Each solvent showed\na distinct mass spectrum dominated by its own\nfragments. While C2H3O+ and C3H6O+ were prominent in acetone spectra\nalongside some C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments, methanol spectra showed strong prevalence of CH3O+, CH4O+, and CHO+ ions (Figure S8). Several C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments were commonly\nobserved in acetone, methanol, and water indicating contamination\nartifacts, though minor. The spectra of filter blank extracts prior\nto solvent background subtraction were also very similar to spiked\nsolvents (Figure S9). These factors further\nsupport that the filter material had a minor influence on the measurement\nbackground, which mainly originated from impurities in solvents or\nthe experimental setup. Henceforth, all analyses are filter blank\ncorrected unless stated otherwise. Methanol is frequently used for\nsample extractions in other analytical techniques and is shown to\nextract diverse chemical species given a midrange polarity index of\n0.7.\n,,\n It also has\nconsiderably lower vapor pressure than acetone (boiling points: 64.7\n°C methanol vs 56 °C acetone) that prevents samples from\nuncontrolled concentrating via solvent evaporation prior to being\nnebulized into the spray chamber. For these reasons, we focus the\ndiscussion on methanol while providing analogous comparisons for acetone-\nand water-based measurements."

      "title": "Bulk OC Solubilities of Ambient OA",
      "text": "The bulk OC solubility was measured directly from the AMS for all\nsolvent extracts as OCams using eq \n and also via the nonpurgeable organic carbon\n(NPOC) analysis of water extracts. All summer and Magadino winter\nwater extracts showed high NPOC content, while Krakow winter samples\nwere less soluble (Figure \n). Overall, the water solubilities of samples analyzed in\nthis study were largely representative of other days in the same season\nfor each site (Figures \n and S10). Furthermore, while the OC solubility\nin wintertime Krakow was lower than in other regions in Europe, mainly\ndue to high coal combustion for residential heating, the solubilities\nof summertime Krakow and all Magadino samples were comparable to other\nEuropean sites.\n−\n\n The contributions of dominant OA sources in Krakow\nand Magadino, i.e., HOA, solid-fuel combustion-related primary OA,\nand oxygenated OA, were also similar to other European locations (Figure S11). Thus, the samples investigated in\nthis study represented typical OA source profiles and bulk OA water\nsolubility across Europe and likely also to other regions, e.g., Asia.\n,, Fractions of organic carbon extracted\nfrom filter samples in acetone\n(red), methanol (blue), and water (light green) extracts measured\nvia SOff-AMS. The NPOC fraction in water extracts is also shown (dark\ngreen). Black star markers indicate season-based slopes of WSOC vs\nOC distributions for all fine PM samples collected in Krakow and Magadino\n(Figure S10). On the x-axis, the samples are labeled denoting sites, particle sizes, and\nseasons in which the samples were collected. “MGD” (Magadino)\nand “KRK” (Krakow) are sampling locations. PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 are particle sizes, and “S”\nand “W” indicate summer and winter seasons. OCams for water extracts showed a comparable\ntrend to\nthat of NPOC, but all summer samples exceeded corresponding NPOC values.\nThe uncertainties in organic mass-to-organic carbon ratios (OM/OC)\nand field blank subtractions at low summer concentrations or loss\nof purgeable inorganic carbon (e.g., carbonates) during acid dissolution\nof sample extracts in NPOC analyses could explain the higher OCams. In general, OC was more soluble in organic solvents compared\nto water (OCams,os/OCams,w) (Figure \n). OCams,os/OCams,w ranged 1.1–4.2 for methanol and 1–5.2 for\nacetone extracts. For both sites, the ratio strongly varied between\nseasons and particle sizes. For fine OA, winter OCams,os/OCams,w (2.9 ± 1.6) was a factor of 2.5 higher than\nsummer (1.2 ± 0.2). For PM10 OA, the ratio increased\nto 3.3 ± 1.5 for winter and 1.3 ± 0.2 for summer samples.\nThe wintertime OC dissolved more in organic solvents, likely due to\nincreased contributions from hydrocarbon-like or other fresh aerosols.\nThis is further evidenced by a high fraction of elemental carbon in\nwinter samples (16–20%), suggesting major contributions from\ncombustion-based nonwater-soluble emissions (Figure S12). Coal combustion POA is an important source in Krakow\nduring winter that contributed 12% to fine OA, alongside 3% from biomass\nburning POA. The OC solubility of Krakow\nsamples enhanced by a factor of 2.8–3.2 in organic solvents\nrelative to water, suggesting substantially increased dissolution\nof coal combustion-related OA. Coal combustion did not contribute\nsignificantly to POA in Magadino, although biomass burning is an important\nsource.\n, The OC solubilities also varied between\nmethanol and acetone extracts.\nFor all winter samples, 53–57% of OCtotal was soluble\nin methanol exceeding 14–40% in water. The solubility increased\nfurther in acetone (67–91%) compared to methanol due to increased\ndissolution of nonpolar OA constituents. The relatively consistent\nsolubility of winter samples in methanol could be attributed to its\nmidscale polarity, permitting the extraction of diverse chemical species.\nAcetone and water have more separated polarities potentially causing\ndissolution of varying fractions of organic mass strongly depending\non OA composition. In comparison, summer samples showed high OC solubilities\nin all solvents including (70–95%) water, (80–120%)\nmethanol, and (80–130%) acetone due to greater oxygenation\nof constituting organic compounds. Overall, the bulk OC measurements\ndemonstrated that SOff-AMS can significantly enhance the OC mass fraction\nthat can be analyzed offline from filters, especially during wintertime\nconditions."

      "title": "Solubility of OA Constituents in Organic Solvents\nVersus Water",
      "text": "The OA spectra differed between sites and seasons\ndepending on influencing factors including differences in precursor\nemissions, environmental conditions, ambient OA levels, and their\nsolubility in the extraction solvent. The spectra of OA extracted\nin organic solvents captured these differences more effectively than\nwater extracts since several mass fragment groups were relatively\nenhanced. The methanol and acetone extracts of winter OA were dominated\nby C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments\nthat constituted over 50% of the HR spectra with smaller contributions\nfrom oxygenated species (36–40%) (Figures S13 and 14). In contrast, only ∼30% of each spectrum\nfrom water extracts was constituted by C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments. For each winter sample,\nextracts in organic solvents produced largely comparable spectra that\nwere dissimilar to water extracts (cosine: 35–50°). In\nthe UMR region spanning m/z 151–467,\nwintertime OA spectra were substantially enhanced in organic solvents\n(Figures \n and S15). The UMR signal constituted 25–28%\n(methanol) and 27–30% (acetone) of the winter OA spectra in\nKrakow, which reduced to 6–7% in water extracts. For Magadino\nwinter, this fraction reduced to 11% in both methanol and acetone\nand was 7% in water extracts (Figure S13). The Magadino HR spectra were comparable across solvents. However,\nmethanol extracts were slightly more similar to water than acetone\n(<15 vs <20°). Overall, these observations indicated lower\nwater-insoluble primary source contributions (coal combustion and\ntraffic exhaust) in Magadino than in Krakow during winter. Enhanced contributions\nin methanol-SOff-AMS measurements relative\nto water-Off-AMS of key ions to (a) fine (PM1 and PM2.5), (b) PM10, and (c) coarse PM spectra from summertime\n(yellow) and wintertime (blue) Krakow and Magadino. More broadly, over all sites and seasons, oxygenated\nfragments\nconstituted 60 ± 2% of the HR spectra from water extracts, and\ntheir OM/OC ratio also remained stable (2.03 ± 0.05). Acetone\nextracts attributed 48 ± 5% to C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments, and the OM/OC was considerably\nlower across seasons and sites (1.6 ± 0.09) (Figure S16). Thus, acetone- and water-based sample extractions\nindicated a certain solubility bias that would benefit a more targeted\nanalysis of select OA constituents. On the other hand, methanol extracts\ncaptured variations in OA composition over a broader range of C\nx\nH\ny\n (37–54%),\noxygenated fragments (41 – 58%), and OM/OC (1.8 ± 0.14). Several key ions were also enhanced in organic solvents (Figures \n and S17–S19). The small hydrocarbon fragments\nincluding C2H3\n+, C2H5\n+, C3H5\n+, C3H7\n+, C4H7\n+, C4H9\n+, C5H7\n+, C5H9\n+, and\nC5H11\n+ increased by a factor of 1.5–60\nin spectra from both Krakow and Magadino. The oxygenated fragments\n(e.g., C2H4O2\n+, C2H5O2\n+, among others) were\ncomparatively less yet clearly enhanced (1.2–2.7). Within each\ncategory of fragment species (e.g., C\nx\nH\ny\n, C\nx\nH\ny\nO\nz\n), higher molecular\nweight ions showed greater enhancement than smaller ones, likely due\nto higher hydrophobicity and increased solubility of larger-molecular-weight\nspecies from hydrocarbon-like OA. However, reduced nitrogen-containing\nfragments exhibited a mixed behavior. C3H8N+ and C3H9N+ that are known\ntracers of cigarette smoke increased considerably (1.5–6),\nwhile CHN+ and CH4N+ were comparable\nin methanol and water but reduced in acetone extracts. Similarly,\nsulfur-containing fragments −CHSO+ and CH3SO2\n+ were reduced by 1–2 orders of magnitude\nin organic solvents (Figures \n, S17 and S18). Consequently, it\nmay be more difficult with SOff-AMS to apportion sources traced via\nthese fragments (e.g., methanesulfonic acid; marine SOA), yet possible\nwith clean backgrounds and application of other potential markers\nthat might be enhanced. The signal enhancement with molecular\nweight was also observed\nin the UMR region of the spectra, which was dominated by PAHs. The\nsignal increased consistently from m/z 128 (4–5) to 252 (40–60) for winter OA in organic\nsolvents. Acetone extracts showed slightly higher ion signal than\nmethanol in this mass range due to lower polarity.\n,\n Summer samples also showed a similar trend for all fragment categories\nbut with weaker enhancement relative to winter (Figures \n and S17), likely\ndue to reduced contributions from PAHs. The magnitude and composition\nof coarse PM were calculated as the\ndifference between the spectra of PM10 and fine PM. While\nOCcoarse was within the measurement error of OCfine for the winter samples indicating minimal to no coarse contributions,\nsignificant coarse OC was observed during summer (Krakow: 1.5 μg/m3, Magadino: 0.3 μg/m3 in methanol extracts).\nThus, we focus the discussion on summertime coarse OA (Figures \nc and S17). At both locations, mainly select hydrocarbon fragments\nwere considerably enhanced in methanol and acetone extracts relative\nto water, with a stronger increase for saturated (C4H9\n+, C5H11\n+, C3H7\n+) than for unsaturated fragments\n(C4H7\n+, C5H9\n+). The enhancement in acetone was a factor of 3–5\nhigher than in methanol. Consequently, observations over a larger\nsample size can likely differentiate sources of coarse PM between\ndifferent measurement locations. The limitations of using water\nas an extraction solvent are clear\nfor winter OA, which produced very similar spectra for Krakow and\nMagadino despite differences in sources between the sites (Figures S13d, S20, and S21). Water extracts summertime OA more effectively than winter, which\nis also evidenced by their increased OC solubility (Figure \n). For these samples, the HR\nspectra (i.e., m/z ≤ 150) constituted >95%\nof the OA mass across all solvent extracts, 50–60% of which\nwere contributed by oxygenated fragments (C\nx\nH\ny\nO and C\nx\nH\ny\nO>1). We\nalso compared our offline analyses of Krakow fine OA with measurements\nfrom a colocated online Q-ACSM that can be considered real-time characterization\nfor our purposes in this study. The SOff-AMS\nspectra were integrated to unit mass resolution and renormalized after\nexcluding large ions (m/z 126–467)\nsince the Q-ACSM measured only up to m/z 125. This comparison should be treated with caution due to differences\nbetween AMS and Q-ACSM instruments. First, the longer sample/background\nswitching interval of Q-ACSM instruments increases the importance\nof slow vaporization processes in the mass spectrum, which can enhance\nthe contributions of ions such as m/z 44. Comparison of m/z > ∼100 should also be treated with\ncaution\ndue to the uncertainty in estimated m/z transmission function of the Q-ACSM, which may cause systematic\nunder/overestimation of ions at high m/z relative to low m/z. Different\nsampling cutoff sizes (AMS: PM2.5 vs Q-ACSM: PM1) could also potentially affect the OA spectra, though minimal under\npolluted conditions. Therefore, the Q-ACSM\nspectrum should not be considered a “gold standard”\ncomparison for SOff-AMS data; nonetheless, comparison remains instructive. The methanol extract and Q-ACSM spectra were highly comparable\nduring winter (cosine: 16–17°) with similar fractions\nof total signal at m/z 44 (f44: 0.03 vs ACSM: 0.06), 43 (f43: 0.05 vs 0.08),\nand 60 (f60: 0.01 vs 0.01) (Figure \na). The acetone and water extracts were slightly\nless comparable, though not entirely dissimilar (cosine: acetone 21°,\nwater 23°) (Figures S22–S24). Comparisons of the (a) wintertime and (b) summertime Krakow PM1 OA spectra analyzed via SOff-AMS of methanol sample extract\nin the laboratory vs directly measured on site using a Q-ACSM. The\nOA spectra of Krakow PM1 samples measured in the laboratory\nfrom methanol and water-based sample extractions are compared for\n(c) winter- and (d) summertime conditions. Summertime ACSM spectra were similar to the water\nextract (cosine:\n18–22°), while methanol (28–30°) and acetone\nextracts (cosine > 40°) were considerably dissimilar (Figures \nd and S22 and 23). The similarity with water extract\nwas strongly influenced by high signals at m/z 28 and 44 in ACSM spectra during summer. Upon excluding\nthese ions (and the derived fragment ions 16, 17, 18), the ACSM spectra\ncompared similarly to water (22–28°) as to methanol (22–24°)\nand acetone extracts (∼29°)."

      "title": "Implications for Ambient Measurements",
      "text": "We showed that SOff-AMS can characterize significantly larger mass\nfraction of wintertime OA with substantial primary- and less-aged\nsource contributions in comparison to water extracts. Furthermore,\nthe SOff-AMS spectra can replicate real-time measurements of ambient\nOA, demonstrating that characterization close to online-level can\nbe achieved in offline laboratory-based measurements. Despite potential\nartifacts from sampling, incomplete solubility, and solvent interactions,\nthe strong agreement between SOff-AMS and Q-ACSM measurements supports\nthe reliability of SOff-AMS for OA characterization. The repeat analyses\nafter 36 h also confirmed the stability of OA spectra in solvent extracts\n(Figure S25). Nevertheless, large-scale\nintercomparisons will be important to further evaluate its performance\nacross diverse environments, sampling, and analysis periods. SOff-AMS\nenhanced the detection of several key markers of anthropogenic and\nbiogenic sources in OA spectra, which can be coupled with source apportionment\ntechniques to constrain sources of fresh ambient OA as well as other\nminor sources. For example, methanol extracts of Krakow winter OA\nnot only showed markedly higher small hydrocarbon contributions relative\nto water extracts but also a substantially higher concentration of\nfragments typically related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs:\n128, 152, 165, 178, 189, 202, 215, 226, 239, 252, and 276) (Figures \n and S15).\n,\n This is consistent\nwith Krakow being strongly affected by fresh and only slightly aged\nresidential coal combustion and wood burning emissions. Wood is the\ndominant solid fuel in wintertime Magadino, so the impact of hydrocarbons\nand PAHs was expectedly smaller (Figure \n) since wood burning emits less PAHs than\ncoal combustion.\n,\n This differentiation is crucial\nfor constraining the relative importance of sources in Krakow, Magadino,\nand other areas that are impacted by fresh combustion and other nonwater-soluble\nemissions.\n, Mass spectra of wintertime fine OA from\nKrakow and Magadino measured\nvia (a) methanol-SOff-AMS and (b) water-Off-AMS. Each spectrum combines\nhigh-resolution (≤m/z 150,\ncolored) and UMR (>m/z 152, black)\nion signals stacked on integer m/z values.

In the absence of a detectable amount of OCcoarse in\nwinter, we focused on the chemical composition of summertime coarse\nOA (Figures \n and S26). In general, acetone extracted a higher\nfraction (60–100%) than methanol and water extracts (35–49%)\nof the OCcoarse measured directly with the Sunset OC analyzer.\nPrevious work based on water extracts has established that AMS fingerprints\nof primary biological organic aerosol such as pollen and fungal spores\nexhibit characteristic peaks C2H5O2\n+ and C2H4O2\n+ with approximately similar intensity in the aerosol spectra. We\nfound this pattern in coarse OA from summertime Krakow and Magadino\nin both methanol and water extracts, however, with different C2H5O2\n+/C2H4O2\n+ ratios. Overall, the spectra showed\nclear differences between the extracts, as shown in Figure \n. Negative peaks at CH2O+, CH3O+, and CH4O+ for methanol extracts are the dominant peaks in solvent\nblanks and are removed due to their high uncertainty. The coarse OA\nspectra from water extracts were characterized by a higher prevalence\nof oxygenated fragments relative to methanol extracts that showed\na stronger presence of C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments.

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nOrganic aerosols (OA)\nconstitute a large fraction of airborne particulate\nmatter and impact both the climate and human health.\n,\n OA is either directly emitted (primary; POA) or is formed via atmospheric\noxidation of gas-phase precursors (secondary; SOA) emitted from diverse\nanthropogenic (e.g., motor vehicles, solid-fuel combustion, asphalt)\nand biogenic (e.g., forests) sources. It is essential to characterize\nthe chemical composition of OA in order to identify its contributing\nsources and constrain their impact. In recent decades, advances\nin mass spectrometry have significantly\nenhanced our understanding of the OA composition and formation processes.\n−\n\n Online techniques, e.g., time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry\n(ToF-AMS) and extractive electrospray ionization (EESI)-ToF MS, provide\nOA composition with very high time-resolution at both bulk and molecular\nlevels for nontrace ambient concentrations.\n−\n\n Other online\nmass spectrometers can also characterize low ambient OA concentrations\nat longer time intervals (e.g., FIGAERO–CIMS). Despite these benefits, the application of online mass\nspectrometers for long-term air quality studies is severely restricted\nby high logistical and maintenance costs in many resource-limited\nurban and rural locations around the world. Offline techniques\n(e.g., liquid chromatography (LC)-ToF, LC-Orbitrap,\nlaser desorption ionization-ToF, two-dimensional gas chromatography-ToF,\nFIGAERO-EESI-MS, among others) overcome these issues by measuring\nthe composition of ambient OA sampled on quartz or Teflon filters\nin a laboratory.\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The samples can be collected using high or low volume samplers that\ncan be easily transported and installed in different locations. Offline\nmethods considerably expand the regions where OA composition can be\ninvestigated cost-effectively via state-of-the-art mass spectrometry.\nFilter sample extracts in organic solvents (e.g., methanol, acetone,\nacetonitrile) are mostly analyzed via soft-ionization-based analytical\ntechniques. However, the detailed chemical information obtained from\nsoft-ionization-based, nontargeted offline analyses is often difficult\nto quantify due to measurement uncertainties originating from sample\npreparation, relative differences in analyte sensitivity to ionization\nschemes, and the unavailability of calibration standards. The\nmore recently developed offline-AMS (Off-AMS) technique has\npermitted quantifiable measurements of ambient OA in laboratory conditions.\n−\n\n\n These measurements can be applied to source apportionment algorithms\n(e.g., positive matrix factorization) to quantify the contributions\nof OA sources. However, Off-AMS typically uses Milli-Q water for sample\nextraction, and filters extracted in organic solvents have been rarely\nmeasured via AMS.\n,\n This limits the analysis to the\nwater-soluble fraction of OA (WSOA) that is largely constituted by\nSOA. Depending on the environment, sources, and seasons, WSOA can\nrange from 15 to 80% of ambient OA.\n−\n\n\n It is often low during winter\nin regions with complex emission portfolios dominated by combustion-based\nsources, e.g., motor vehicles and solid-fuel burning, where WSOA may\nconstitute less than 50% of the total OA mass. Consequently, source\napportionment analyses based on Off-AMS measurements can mainly identify\nsources that are fully or at least somewhat water-soluble. The sources\nof POA and non-WSOA must be estimated either via empirical methods\nor corrected for with substantial uncertainties. Such corrections\ncan introduce additional uncertainties in analyses and source apportionment\noutcomes.\n,, Here,\nwe present a new analytical approach to overcome these challenges\nby coupling Off-AMS with filter samples extracted in organic solvents\n(hereon SOff-AMS). Via analyzing ambient samples collected from different\nenvironments, we demonstrate that (i) SOff-AMS substantially increases\nthe extractable fraction of organic carbon that is quantitatively\nanalyzed constraining both primary (e.g., fossil-fuel combustion)\nand secondary (e.g., oxygenated organic aerosol) sources; (ii) the\nSOff-AMS-based OA spectra compare well with online measurements suggesting\nthat online-level characterization can be achieved offline with this\ntechnique, and; (iii) water-insoluble coarse OA fraction of ambient\nPM can also be quantitatively characterized via this technique, which\nhas traditionally been challenging to study via both online and offline\nmethods. Overall, SOff-AMS is a powerful offline technique to comprehensively\ncharacterize ambient OA. It can considerably expand the reach of atmospheric\nchemistry studies to diverse urban and rural locations worldwide,\nwhere online measurements with advanced mass spectrometers are usually\nnot feasible.\n\n## Materials and Methods\nA total of 8 multiseason\nfilter samples were collected for these tests in Magadino (Switzerland)\nand Krakow (Poland). In Magadino, PM2.5 and PM10 samples were collected on 1 January 2019 and 27 June 2018 at the\nMagadino-Cadenazzo site (part of the Swiss National Air Pollution\nMonitoring Network – NABEL), while in Krakow, PM1 and PM10 samples were collected on 26 January 2018 and\n27 June 2018 on the roof of the Physics and Applied Computer Science\nFaculty of the AGH University building (20 m.a.g.). Some additional\n24 h fine PM filters were also collected on other days for different\npurposes; here, only the water-soluble organic carbon and total organic\ncarbon analyses are used (performed with the same protocols as for\nsamples in this study, details below). The sampling occurred on quartz\nfilters using high volume samplers at a nominal flow rate of 0.5 m3 min–1 for 24 h each (00–23.59 h). SOff-AMS builds\non prior Off-AMS work by replacing Milli-Q water with organic solvents\nfor sample extraction.\n,\n High-purity acetone (Sigma-Aldrich,\nCAS:67–64–1; ≥99.8% purity) and ultrahigh-purity\nmethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS:67–56–1; ≥99.92%\npurity) were used for this purpose. These solvents were selected since\ntheir use for preparing filter sample extracts is well-documented\nin previous studies.\n,,−\n\n\n\n\n Filter samples extracted in ultrapure Milli-Q water were also measured\nfor reference. In total, 24 sample extracts were prepared including\nboth sites -8 in acetone, 8 in methanol, and 8 in water. The Krakow\nwinter samples were extracted using 4 punches of 16 mm diameter per\nextract, while the remaining samples were extracted using 5 punches\nper extract. The punches were dissolved in 20 mL of organic solvent\nor Milli-Q water in a glass vial by sonicating for 20 min at 30 °C,\nfollowed by vortex treatment for 1 min. Subsequently, the vortexed\nextracts in organic solvents were filtered using PTFE syringe filters\n(Infochroma; product # 8813Y-P4̅; pore size:\n0.45 μm) attached to a glass syringe (SOCOREX Dosys # 155.0310).\nThe glass syringes and PTFE filters were replaced with PTFE syringes\nand nylon filters (Infochroma; product # 8813Y–N-4; pore size:\n0.45 μm) for water extracts to be consistent with the prior\nwater-based extraction procedure. All\nfilter extracts were spiked with 250 μL of 200 ppm of isotopically\nlabeled ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate solution (15NH4\n15NO3, (15NH4)2\n34SO4) used as internal standard.\nThe glass vials and glass syringes were extensively rinsed prior to\nuse with Milli-Q water, followed by HPLC-grade acetone and methanol,\nand heated at 100 °C in a furnace for 14 h to eliminate background\ncontamination. The PTFE syringes were rinsed with 120 mL of Milli-Q\nwater prior to use but were not heat-treated. The PTFE filters were\nrinsed with ∼100 mL of sample extraction solvent. Filter blanks\nand pure solvents spiked with the internal standard were also measured\nfollowing the same protocols. The extracts were nebulized using\nsynthetic air via a microflow nebulizer (Apex 2.0; Elemental Scientific\nInc.) at a flow rate of 0.7 slpm into a cyclonic spray chamber. The\nchamber was maintained at 60 °C for water extracts and at 25\n°C for methanol and acetone extracts to achieve a stable AMS\nsignal during measurements. The excess solvent was condensed out by\na Peltier-cooled condenser maintained at 2 °C and evacuated using\nan inbuilt peristaltic pump in the nebulizer. For water extracts,\na Nafion dryer (Perma Pure LLC) was additionally installed downstream\nof the nebulizer. The sample spray was diluted with 2.1 slpm, 2.8\nslpm, and 5 slpm of clean airflow for water, methanol, and acetone\nextracts, respectively. The dilution ratios were established following\nseveral trials to optimize the stability of the AMS signal during\nsample measurements. The resulting aerosols were measured via a high-resolution\nlong-time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (LToF-AMS) (Aerodyne\nResearch Inc.). The operating principles of the AMS instrument are\ndescribed in detail by DeCarlo et al., and the offline protocols are thoroughly discussed elsewhere.\n,, Two sets of stainless-steel\ntransfer lines were used between the\nnebulizer and the AMS, one set reserved for organic solvents and the\nother for water extracts. These steps were taken to avoid cross-contamination\nbetween solvents- and water-based measurements and to maintain a clean\nbackground. Samples extracted in different solvents were analyzed\nin separate batches. The transfer lines were flushed thoroughly for\nseveral hours before switching between the batches. The analysis sequence\nbegan by measuring spiked solvent, followed by extracts (Figure \n, filter blanks were\nmeasured following the same sequence). During analysis, a 6-to-8 min\nsolvent flush was performed between samples to eliminate potential\nmemory effects and ensure a low background signal between sample runs.\nDepending on the solvent, OA of the least polluted sample measured\nby the AMS in this study (i.e., summertime Magadino PM2.5) exceeded spiked solvent blank by a factor of 5–12 and by\n21–25 for the more polluted winter samples (Figure \n). The AMS data were analyzed\nusing Squirrel (v1.64) and Pika (v1.24) modules on the IGOR Pro software\nplatform (Wavemetrics, Inc., Portland, OR). The high-resolution ion\nfragments were fitted to peaks between m/z 12 and 150 in each mass spectrum. The signals beyond m/z 150 were analyzed at unit mass resolution\n(UMR). Finally, the two sections of the mass spectra were combined\nto obtain a complete organic mass spectrum. For the samples from Krakow,\nthe OA spectra from SOff-AMS were also compared with data collected\nfrom a colocated online Q-ACSM (PM1 inlet, standard vaporizer,\nAerodyne Research Inc.), averaged over a 24 h period corresponding\nto the filter collection date. This allowed\nus to assess the effectiveness of SOff-AMS in replicating real-time\ncharacterization of ambient OA. In addition, the least and most polluted\nsamples used in this study (i.e., summertime Magadino PM2.5 and wintertime Krakow PM10, respectively) were stored\nin the dark at 4 °C and remeasured after 36 h to check for stability\nin aerosol spectra. Example timeseries of HROrg, HRNO3, and HRSO4 of filter samples extracted in (a) methanol, (b) acetone,\nand (c)\nwater during SOff-AMS measurements. The labels 1–4 indicate\nsummer ambient samples including Magadino: (1) PM2.5 and\n(3) PM10, and Krakow: (2) PM1 and (4) PM10. Winter samples included Magadino: (5) PM2.5 and\n(6) PM10, and Krakow: (7) PM1 and (8) PM10. The sampling order (1–8) in (a) methanol tests is\nreplicated in (b) acetone and (c) water measurements. The combined organic\nAMS spectrum (HR m/z 12–150\nand UMR m/z 151–467) extracted\nfrom samples was directly quantified from AMS measurements using eq \n, which is discussed in\ndetail by Casotto et al.\n1OAAMS,i,m/z(μgm−3)=IAMS,i,m/zRIEorg*c.1Ii,15NO3·MIS·AAp·1VaHere, OAams,i,m/z\n is the organic aerosol concentration in μg\nm–3 of an ion in question (m/z) for a sample or blank “i”. I\nAMS,m/z\n is the average\nsignal from the AMS of an ion (m/z ≤ 150: HR, m/z > 150\nUMR)\nin units of ion frequency, I\ni,15NO3\n is the labeled nitrate signal measured as the sum of\nthe frequencies of 15NO+ and 15NO2\n+, and MIS is the mass of labeled nitrate\nadded as internal standard to each sample calculated as shown in eq \n.2MIS=MIS′·MIS(j15NO3)MIS(NH4j15NO3)Here, M\nIS\n’ is the total mass of\ninternal standard injected, and MIS(15NO3)/MIS(NH4\n15NO3) is the mass fraction of labeled nitrate in the internal standard. A is the total filter area used in sample collection, A\np is the filter area punched for sample extraction,\nand V\na is the total volume of air sampled\nduring filter collection. For all filter samples, ion concentrations\ncalculated via eq \n were\nfilter background-corrected prior to further analysis using a pure\nsolvent measurement that was spiked with an internal standard. Returning to eq \n, RIEorg is the default literature relative ionization efficiency\nof organics in the AMS taken 1.4. However, the AMS used in the present\nstudy operated with an usually high RIE for organics, represented\nhere as the product of RIEorg and the correction factor\n“c” (this formulation is chosen to\nemphasize that the organic RIE estimated herein represents the unusual\nperformance of the specific instrument used and should not be held\ngenerally true for all AMS instruments). To estimate c, we assumed that the RIE of organics is equal to the RIE of levoglucosan.\nPrevious studies have shown the RIE of levoglucosan to be 1.4–1.8\nfor AMS and 1.27–1.4 for ACSM, which is consistent with the\ntypical organics RIE of 1.4.\n,\n This allowed us to\ncalibrate for deviations in our AMS instrument relative to others.\nWe determined c to be 1.86 ± 0.1, as shown later in Figure \na. (a) Calibration curves\nfor levoglucosan prepared in acetone, methanol,\nand water. (b–d) AMS spectra of levoglucosan OA aerosolized\nin (b) methanol, (c) acetone, and (d) water. Note: Panel (a) shows\nslope-adjusted linearity in instrument response to levoglucosan with\na calculated average correction factor of 1.86. The measurement errors after background correction\nwere propagated\nbased on eq \n using the\nstandard deviation in spectra recorded over the measurement period\nof a filter sample (σOA,i,m/z\n) and spiked solvent blank (σOA,B,m/z\n), processed with eq \n\n3σOAAMS,i,m/z(μgm−3)=(σOAAMS,i,m/z)2+(σOAAMS,B,m/z)2 The OA concentration was calculated\nas the sum of all organic aerosol\nfragments4OAAMS,i(μgm−3)=∑m/zOAAMS,i,m/z To compare to reference measurements,\nwe further calculated the\nOC concentration as the sum of all organic aerosol ions divided by\nthe bulk organic matter-to-organic carbon ratio (OM/OC). OM/OC was\ncalculated using the improved-ambient method based on Canagaratna\net al. implemented in the analytic procedure for elemental separation (APES) v1.09 module built on the IGOR Pro software platform.\n5OCAMS,i(μgm−3)=∑m/zOAAMS,i,m/z(OM/OC)i We proceeded analogously for inorganic\nconstituents. Nitrate was\nquantified using the total AMS signal of 14NO+ and 14NO2\n+ ions instead of I\nAMS,m/z\n, and\nsimilarly 32SO+ and 32SO2\n+ and their isotopically labeled counterparts (34SO+ and 34SO2\n+) were\nused for sulfate. Since the RIE for the pairs 14NO3 – 15NO3 and 32SO4 – 34SO4 can be assumed to be\nthe same, the RIE term was omitted from the equation. The WSOC content in the filter samples was\nmeasured with a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer (TOC-LCPH; Shimadzu), extracted analogously to those for AMS analyses. The\norganic carbon constituents were oxidized to CO2 using\nhydrochloric acid and measured using a “680 °C combustion\ncatalytic oxidation with nondispersive infrared (NDIR) detection”\ntechnique. Given the nature of the solvent, no analogous analyses\ncould be performed for methanol and acetone extracts. In addition,\nthe total organic carbon (OCtotal) and elemental carbon\n(EC) content of filter samples was measured via the thermo-optical\ntransmittance (TOT) method, using a Lab OC-EC Aerosol Analyzer (Model\n5 L, Sunset Laboratory Inc.) and adhering to the EUSAAR-2 protocol.\nQuartz filter samples undergo heating up to 650 °C in a helium-rich\natmosphere initially, followed by further heating up to 850 °C\nin a mixture of 2% oxygen gas in helium, using the controlled heating\nramps specified in the EUSAAR-2 thermal protocol. During this process, OC evolves in the inert atmosphere,\nwhile EC undergoes oxidation in the helium–oxygen atmosphere.\nCharring correction is implemented by monitoring the sample transmittance\nthroughout the heating process. The limit of detection (LOD) for TOT\nanalysis was 0.02 μg m–3 of carbon. The field\nblanks were prepared and processed following identical procedures.\nFor optimal comparability between the samples, all samples were measured\non the same day in the same laboratory. The uncertainty is calculated\nat 15% for OC and 23% for EC and takes into account the limits of\ndetection, reproducibility, repeatability, and precision based on\nreferences, the detector sensitivity uncertainty, and the area uncertainty\nof the filter.\n\n## Sample Collection\nA total of 8 multiseason\nfilter samples were collected for these tests in Magadino (Switzerland)\nand Krakow (Poland). In Magadino, PM2.5 and PM10 samples were collected on 1 January 2019 and 27 June 2018 at the\nMagadino-Cadenazzo site (part of the Swiss National Air Pollution\nMonitoring Network – NABEL), while in Krakow, PM1 and PM10 samples were collected on 26 January 2018 and\n27 June 2018 on the roof of the Physics and Applied Computer Science\nFaculty of the AGH University building (20 m.a.g.). Some additional\n24 h fine PM filters were also collected on other days for different\npurposes; here, only the water-soluble organic carbon and total organic\ncarbon analyses are used (performed with the same protocols as for\nsamples in this study, details below). The sampling occurred on quartz\nfilters using high volume samplers at a nominal flow rate of 0.5 m3 min–1 for 24 h each (00–23.59 h).\n\n## SOff-AMS Analysis\nSOff-AMS builds\non prior Off-AMS work by replacing Milli-Q water with organic solvents\nfor sample extraction.\n,\n High-purity acetone (Sigma-Aldrich,\nCAS:67–64–1; ≥99.8% purity) and ultrahigh-purity\nmethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS:67–56–1; ≥99.92%\npurity) were used for this purpose. These solvents were selected since\ntheir use for preparing filter sample extracts is well-documented\nin previous studies.\n,,−\n\n\n\n\n Filter samples extracted in ultrapure Milli-Q water were also measured\nfor reference. In total, 24 sample extracts were prepared including\nboth sites -8 in acetone, 8 in methanol, and 8 in water. The Krakow\nwinter samples were extracted using 4 punches of 16 mm diameter per\nextract, while the remaining samples were extracted using 5 punches\nper extract. The punches were dissolved in 20 mL of organic solvent\nor Milli-Q water in a glass vial by sonicating for 20 min at 30 °C,\nfollowed by vortex treatment for 1 min. Subsequently, the vortexed\nextracts in organic solvents were filtered using PTFE syringe filters\n(Infochroma; product # 8813Y-P4̅; pore size:\n0.45 μm) attached to a glass syringe (SOCOREX Dosys # 155.0310).\nThe glass syringes and PTFE filters were replaced with PTFE syringes\nand nylon filters (Infochroma; product # 8813Y–N-4; pore size:\n0.45 μm) for water extracts to be consistent with the prior\nwater-based extraction procedure. All\nfilter extracts were spiked with 250 μL of 200 ppm of isotopically\nlabeled ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate solution (15NH4\n15NO3, (15NH4)2\n34SO4) used as internal standard.\nThe glass vials and glass syringes were extensively rinsed prior to\nuse with Milli-Q water, followed by HPLC-grade acetone and methanol,\nand heated at 100 °C in a furnace for 14 h to eliminate background\ncontamination. The PTFE syringes were rinsed with 120 mL of Milli-Q\nwater prior to use but were not heat-treated. The PTFE filters were\nrinsed with ∼100 mL of sample extraction solvent. Filter blanks\nand pure solvents spiked with the internal standard were also measured\nfollowing the same protocols. The extracts were nebulized using\nsynthetic air via a microflow nebulizer (Apex 2.0; Elemental Scientific\nInc.) at a flow rate of 0.7 slpm into a cyclonic spray chamber. The\nchamber was maintained at 60 °C for water extracts and at 25\n°C for methanol and acetone extracts to achieve a stable AMS\nsignal during measurements. The excess solvent was condensed out by\na Peltier-cooled condenser maintained at 2 °C and evacuated using\nan inbuilt peristaltic pump in the nebulizer. For water extracts,\na Nafion dryer (Perma Pure LLC) was additionally installed downstream\nof the nebulizer. The sample spray was diluted with 2.1 slpm, 2.8\nslpm, and 5 slpm of clean airflow for water, methanol, and acetone\nextracts, respectively. The dilution ratios were established following\nseveral trials to optimize the stability of the AMS signal during\nsample measurements. The resulting aerosols were measured via a high-resolution\nlong-time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (LToF-AMS) (Aerodyne\nResearch Inc.). The operating principles of the AMS instrument are\ndescribed in detail by DeCarlo et al., and the offline protocols are thoroughly discussed elsewhere.\n,, Two sets of stainless-steel\ntransfer lines were used between the\nnebulizer and the AMS, one set reserved for organic solvents and the\nother for water extracts. These steps were taken to avoid cross-contamination\nbetween solvents- and water-based measurements and to maintain a clean\nbackground. Samples extracted in different solvents were analyzed\nin separate batches. The transfer lines were flushed thoroughly for\nseveral hours before switching between the batches. The analysis sequence\nbegan by measuring spiked solvent, followed by extracts (Figure \n, filter blanks were\nmeasured following the same sequence). During analysis, a 6-to-8 min\nsolvent flush was performed between samples to eliminate potential\nmemory effects and ensure a low background signal between sample runs.\nDepending on the solvent, OA of the least polluted sample measured\nby the AMS in this study (i.e., summertime Magadino PM2.5) exceeded spiked solvent blank by a factor of 5–12 and by\n21–25 for the more polluted winter samples (Figure \n). The AMS data were analyzed\nusing Squirrel (v1.64) and Pika (v1.24) modules on the IGOR Pro software\nplatform (Wavemetrics, Inc., Portland, OR). The high-resolution ion\nfragments were fitted to peaks between m/z 12 and 150 in each mass spectrum. The signals beyond m/z 150 were analyzed at unit mass resolution\n(UMR). Finally, the two sections of the mass spectra were combined\nto obtain a complete organic mass spectrum. For the samples from Krakow,\nthe OA spectra from SOff-AMS were also compared with data collected\nfrom a colocated online Q-ACSM (PM1 inlet, standard vaporizer,\nAerodyne Research Inc.), averaged over a 24 h period corresponding\nto the filter collection date. This allowed\nus to assess the effectiveness of SOff-AMS in replicating real-time\ncharacterization of ambient OA. In addition, the least and most polluted\nsamples used in this study (i.e., summertime Magadino PM2.5 and wintertime Krakow PM10, respectively) were stored\nin the dark at 4 °C and remeasured after 36 h to check for stability\nin aerosol spectra. Example timeseries of HROrg, HRNO3, and HRSO4 of filter samples extracted in (a) methanol, (b) acetone,\nand (c)\nwater during SOff-AMS measurements. The labels 1–4 indicate\nsummer ambient samples including Magadino: (1) PM2.5 and\n(3) PM10, and Krakow: (2) PM1 and (4) PM10.

The sampling order (1–8) in (a) methanol tests is\nreplicated in (b) acetone and (c) water measurements.\n\n## AMS Data Treatment\nThe combined organic\nAMS spectrum (HR m/z 12–150\nand UMR m/z 151–467) extracted\nfrom samples was directly quantified from AMS measurements using eq \n, which is discussed in\ndetail by Casotto et al.\n1OAAMS,i,m/z(μgm−3)=IAMS,i,m/zRIEorg*c.1Ii,15NO3·MIS·AAp·1VaHere, OAams,i,m/z\n is the organic aerosol concentration in μg\nm–3 of an ion in question (m/z) for a sample or blank “i”.

A is the total filter area used in sample collection, A\np is the filter area punched for sample extraction,\nand V\na is the total volume of air sampled\nduring filter collection. For all filter samples, ion concentrations\ncalculated via eq \n were\nfilter background-corrected prior to further analysis using a pure\nsolvent measurement that was spiked with an internal standard. Returning to eq \n, RIEorg is the default literature relative ionization efficiency\nof organics in the AMS taken 1.4. However, the AMS used in the present\nstudy operated with an usually high RIE for organics, represented\nhere as the product of RIEorg and the correction factor\n“c” (this formulation is chosen to\nemphasize that the organic RIE estimated herein represents the unusual\nperformance of the specific instrument used and should not be held\ngenerally true for all AMS instruments). To estimate c, we assumed that the RIE of organics is equal to the RIE of levoglucosan.\nPrevious studies have shown the RIE of levoglucosan to be 1.4–1.8\nfor AMS and 1.27–1.4 for ACSM, which is consistent with the\ntypical organics RIE of 1.4.\n,\n This allowed us to\ncalibrate for deviations in our AMS instrument relative to others.\nWe determined c to be 1.86 ± 0.1, as shown later in Figure \na.

The measurement errors after background correction\nwere propagated\nbased on eq \n using the\nstandard deviation in spectra recorded over the measurement period\nof a filter sample (σOA,i,m/z\n) and spiked solvent blank (σOA,B,m/z\n), processed with eq \n\n3σOAAMS,i,m/z(μgm−3)=(σOAAMS,i,m/z)2+(σOAAMS,B,m/z)2 The OA concentration was calculated\nas the sum of all organic aerosol\nfragments4OAAMS,i(μgm−3)=∑m/zOAAMS,i,m/z To compare to reference measurements,\nwe further calculated the\nOC concentration as the sum of all organic aerosol ions divided by\nthe bulk organic matter-to-organic carbon ratio (OM/OC). OM/OC was\ncalculated using the improved-ambient method based on Canagaratna\net al. implemented in the analytic procedure for elemental separation (APES) v1.09 module built on the IGOR Pro software platform.\n5OCAMS,i(μgm−3)=∑m/zOAAMS,i,m/z(OM/OC)i We proceeded analogously for inorganic\nconstituents. Nitrate was\nquantified using the total AMS signal of 14NO+ and 14NO2\n+ ions instead of I\nAMS,m/z\n, and\nsimilarly 32SO+ and 32SO2\n+ and their isotopically labeled counterparts (34SO+ and 34SO2\n+) were\nused for sulfate. Since the RIE for the pairs 14NO3 – 15NO3 and 32SO4 – 34SO4 can be assumed to be\nthe same, the RIE term was omitted from the equation.\n\n## Reference Analyses of Water-Soluble and Total\nOrganic Carbon\nThe WSOC content in the filter samples was\nmeasured with a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer (TOC-LCPH; Shimadzu), extracted analogously to those for AMS analyses. The\norganic carbon constituents were oxidized to CO2 using\nhydrochloric acid and measured using a “680 °C combustion\ncatalytic oxidation with nondispersive infrared (NDIR) detection”\ntechnique. Given the nature of the solvent, no analogous analyses\ncould be performed for methanol and acetone extracts. In addition,\nthe total organic carbon (OCtotal) and elemental carbon\n(EC) content of filter samples was measured via the thermo-optical\ntransmittance (TOT) method, using a Lab OC-EC Aerosol Analyzer (Model\n5 L, Sunset Laboratory Inc.) and adhering to the EUSAAR-2 protocol.\nQuartz filter samples undergo heating up to 650 °C in a helium-rich\natmosphere initially, followed by further heating up to 850 °C\nin a mixture of 2% oxygen gas in helium, using the controlled heating\nramps specified in the EUSAAR-2 thermal protocol. During this process, OC evolves in the inert atmosphere,\nwhile EC undergoes oxidation in the helium–oxygen atmosphere.\nCharring correction is implemented by monitoring the sample transmittance\nthroughout the heating process. The limit of detection (LOD) for TOT\nanalysis was 0.02 μg m–3 of carbon. The field\nblanks were prepared and processed following identical procedures.\nFor optimal comparability between the samples, all samples were measured\non the same day in the same laboratory. The uncertainty is calculated\nat 15% for OC and 23% for EC and takes into account the limits of\ndetection, reproducibility, repeatability, and precision based on\nreferences, the detector sensitivity uncertainty, and the area uncertainty\nof the filter.\n\n## Results and Discussion\nFive-point calibrations were performed for all solvents using mixes\nprepared with levoglucosan and inorganic standards (ammonium nitrate\nand ammonium sulfate) (Figures \n and S1). The mixes were spiked\nwith the internal standard, nebulized, and measured using the same\nmethod as for sample extracts. The calibration slopes showed 80–90%\nrecovery of the injected concentrations for inorganic standards. The\nslope of the levoglucosan calibration was used to determine the corrected\norganic RIE (RIEorg * c) as discussed\npreviously (this correction is already applied in Figure \na, yielding data in good agreement\nwith the 1:1 line). With the corrected RIE applied, OCams compared well with the reference OC measured\nusing the TOC analyzer. The solvent background-subtracted levoglucosan\nspectra were strongly similar across solvents (cosine angles: 9–13°)\nwith strong signals at characteristic m/z 60 and 73 contributed by C2H4O2\n+ and C3H5O2\n+ fragments (Figure \n).\n,\n Ion intensities of small molecular weight\nfragments (<m/z 80) including\nC\nx\nH\ny\n and other\noxygenated ions that formed majority of the total spectra were also\ncomparable between all solvents (Figure S2). Some differences were observed beyond m/z > 80; larger C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments were more prominent in methanol and acetone\nextracts relative to water, while oxygenated ions showed higher signal\nin water relative to acetone and were comparable in methanol. These\nions constituted less than 1% of the total spectra. Artifacts introduced\nby imperfect solvent background subtractions were evaluated by comparing\nthe resulting levoglucosan mass spectra to a best-estimate spectrum.\nThe best-estimate spectrum was calculated as the average spectrum\nof the three solvents for the highest levoglucosan concentration (6\nμg mL–1). For each fragment ion, data from\nsolvents exhibiting background subtraction imperfections, such as\nresidual solvent signals at low levoglucosan concentrations, were\nexcluded. Thereby, we found that mainly fragment ions that are major\ncontributors to the solvent background were affected in the levoglucosan\nmass spectrum (Figures S3 and S4), with\nspecific influences from acetone (C2H3O+- and CO2-related peaks), methanol (CH3O+), and water (CO2\n+). However,\nthese effects had only a minor impact on the OM/OC ratio (within 4%\nof the best-estimate value: Figure S5)\nand the determined mass concentration (within 10% of the true concentration: Figure S6). Furthermore, we also investigated\nsolvent removal from four mixtures containing different concentrations\nof inorganic standards (2–5 μg mL–1 NH4\n14NO3; 2.5 μg mL–1 NH4\n15NO3; 2–5 μg mL–1 NH4\n32SO4; 2.5 μg\nmL–1 NH4\n34SO4)\nthat showed no considerable change in organic aerosol detected by\nthe AMS (∑\nm/z\n\nI\nAMS,i,m/z\n)\nwith increasing salt concentrations (Figure S7). The levels of OCams for spiked solvent procedural\nblanks\nwere 1.4 μg mL–1 (29 μg) in acetone,\n0.6 μg mL–1 (11 μg) in methanol, and\n0.2 μg mL–1 (4.9 μg) in water. Based\non these analyses, we estimate the procedural limits of detection\n(LoDSB, defined here as 3 standard deviations of the spiked\nsolvent procedural blank) of OCams were 0.8 μg mL–1 (16 μg) in acetone, 0.15 μg mL–1 (3 μg) in methanol, and 0.2 μg mL–1 (4 μg) in water. Without solvent background subtraction, the\nmeasured OCams of filter blanks (FB) were comparable for\nmethanol (0.6 μg mL–1:11 μg) and 1.7\ntimes higher for acetone (2.5 μg mL–1: 50\nμg) and 1.5 times higher for water (0.3 μg mL–1: 7 μg). Thus, the procedural blanks dominated the OCams measured for the filter blanks. The LoDFB of OCams was defined here as 3 standard deviations of the filter blank analyses,\ni.e., it describes the minimum amount of OCams required\nfrom an atmospheric aerosol filter sample. LoDFB was 1.3\nμg mL–1 (26 μg) in acetone, 0.03 μg\nmL–1 (0.6 μg) in methanol, and 0.05 μg\nmL–1 (1 μg) in water. These were substantially\nlower than the sample with the lowest solvent background-subtracted\nOCams (PM2.5 Magadino summer) with 3.9 μg\nmL–1 (78 μg) in acetone, 4.2 μg mL–1 (83 μg) in methanol, and 3.4 μg mL–1 (68 μg) in water. Each solvent showed\na distinct mass spectrum dominated by its own\nfragments. While C2H3O+ and C3H6O+ were prominent in acetone spectra\nalongside some C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments, methanol spectra showed strong prevalence of CH3O+, CH4O+, and CHO+ ions (Figure S8). Several C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments were commonly\nobserved in acetone, methanol, and water indicating contamination\nartifacts, though minor. The spectra of filter blank extracts prior\nto solvent background subtraction were also very similar to spiked\nsolvents (Figure S9). These factors further\nsupport that the filter material had a minor influence on the measurement\nbackground, which mainly originated from impurities in solvents or\nthe experimental setup. Henceforth, all analyses are filter blank\ncorrected unless stated otherwise. Methanol is frequently used for\nsample extractions in other analytical techniques and is shown to\nextract diverse chemical species given a midrange polarity index of\n0.7.\n,,\n It also has\nconsiderably lower vapor pressure than acetone (boiling points: 64.7\n°C methanol vs 56 °C acetone) that prevents samples from\nuncontrolled concentrating via solvent evaporation prior to being\nnebulized into the spray chamber. For these reasons, we focus the\ndiscussion on methanol while providing analogous comparisons for acetone-\nand water-based measurements. The bulk OC solubility was measured directly from the AMS for all\nsolvent extracts as OCams using eq \n and also via the nonpurgeable organic carbon\n(NPOC) analysis of water extracts. All summer and Magadino winter\nwater extracts showed high NPOC content, while Krakow winter samples\nwere less soluble (Figure \n). Overall, the water solubilities of samples analyzed in\nthis study were largely representative of other days in the same season\nfor each site (Figures \n and S10). Furthermore, while the OC solubility\nin wintertime Krakow was lower than in other regions in Europe, mainly\ndue to high coal combustion for residential heating, the solubilities\nof summertime Krakow and all Magadino samples were comparable to other\nEuropean sites.\n−\n\n The contributions of dominant OA sources in Krakow\nand Magadino, i.e., HOA, solid-fuel combustion-related primary OA,\nand oxygenated OA, were also similar to other European locations (Figure S11). Thus, the samples investigated in\nthis study represented typical OA source profiles and bulk OA water\nsolubility across Europe and likely also to other regions, e.g., Asia.\n,, Fractions of organic carbon extracted\nfrom filter samples in acetone\n(red), methanol (blue), and water (light green) extracts measured\nvia SOff-AMS. The NPOC fraction in water extracts is also shown (dark\ngreen). Black star markers indicate season-based slopes of WSOC vs\nOC distributions for all fine PM samples collected in Krakow and Magadino\n(Figure S10). On the x-axis, the samples are labeled denoting sites, particle sizes, and\nseasons in which the samples were collected. “MGD” (Magadino)\nand “KRK” (Krakow) are sampling locations. PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 are particle sizes, and “S”\nand “W” indicate summer and winter seasons. OCams for water extracts showed a comparable\ntrend to\nthat of NPOC, but all summer samples exceeded corresponding NPOC values.\nThe uncertainties in organic mass-to-organic carbon ratios (OM/OC)\nand field blank subtractions at low summer concentrations or loss\nof purgeable inorganic carbon (e.g., carbonates) during acid dissolution\nof sample extracts in NPOC analyses could explain the higher OCams. In general, OC was more soluble in organic solvents compared\nto water (OCams,os/OCams,w) (Figure \n). OCams,os/OCams,w ranged 1.1–4.2 for methanol and 1–5.2 for\nacetone extracts. For both sites, the ratio strongly varied between\nseasons and particle sizes. For fine OA, winter OCams,os/OCams,w (2.9 ± 1.6) was a factor of 2.5 higher than\nsummer (1.2 ± 0.2). For PM10 OA, the ratio increased\nto 3.3 ± 1.5 for winter and 1.3 ± 0.2 for summer samples.\nThe wintertime OC dissolved more in organic solvents, likely due to\nincreased contributions from hydrocarbon-like or other fresh aerosols.\nThis is further evidenced by a high fraction of elemental carbon in\nwinter samples (16–20%), suggesting major contributions from\ncombustion-based nonwater-soluble emissions (Figure S12). Coal combustion POA is an important source in Krakow\nduring winter that contributed 12% to fine OA, alongside 3% from biomass\nburning POA. The OC solubility of Krakow\nsamples enhanced by a factor of 2.8–3.2 in organic solvents\nrelative to water, suggesting substantially increased dissolution\nof coal combustion-related OA. Coal combustion did not contribute\nsignificantly to POA in Magadino, although biomass burning is an important\nsource.\n, The OC solubilities also varied between\nmethanol and acetone extracts.\nFor all winter samples, 53–57% of OCtotal was soluble\nin methanol exceeding 14–40% in water. The solubility increased\nfurther in acetone (67–91%) compared to methanol due to increased\ndissolution of nonpolar OA constituents. The relatively consistent\nsolubility of winter samples in methanol could be attributed to its\nmidscale polarity, permitting the extraction of diverse chemical species.\nAcetone and water have more separated polarities potentially causing\ndissolution of varying fractions of organic mass strongly depending\non OA composition. In comparison, summer samples showed high OC solubilities\nin all solvents including (70–95%) water, (80–120%)\nmethanol, and (80–130%) acetone due to greater oxygenation\nof constituting organic compounds. Overall, the bulk OC measurements\ndemonstrated that SOff-AMS can significantly enhance the OC mass fraction\nthat can be analyzed offline from filters, especially during wintertime\nconditions. The OA spectra differed between sites and seasons\ndepending on influencing factors including differences in precursor\nemissions, environmental conditions, ambient OA levels, and their\nsolubility in the extraction solvent. The spectra of OA extracted\nin organic solvents captured these differences more effectively than\nwater extracts since several mass fragment groups were relatively\nenhanced. The methanol and acetone extracts of winter OA were dominated\nby C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments\nthat constituted over 50% of the HR spectra with smaller contributions\nfrom oxygenated species (36–40%) (Figures S13 and 14). In contrast, only ∼30% of each spectrum\nfrom water extracts was constituted by C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments. For each winter sample,\nextracts in organic solvents produced largely comparable spectra that\nwere dissimilar to water extracts (cosine: 35–50°). In\nthe UMR region spanning m/z 151–467,\nwintertime OA spectra were substantially enhanced in organic solvents\n(Figures \n and S15). The UMR signal constituted 25–28%\n(methanol) and 27–30% (acetone) of the winter OA spectra in\nKrakow, which reduced to 6–7% in water extracts. For Magadino\nwinter, this fraction reduced to 11% in both methanol and acetone\nand was 7% in water extracts (Figure S13). The Magadino HR spectra were comparable across solvents. However,\nmethanol extracts were slightly more similar to water than acetone\n(<15 vs <20°). Overall, these observations indicated lower\nwater-insoluble primary source contributions (coal combustion and\ntraffic exhaust) in Magadino than in Krakow during winter. Enhanced contributions\nin methanol-SOff-AMS measurements relative\nto water-Off-AMS of key ions to (a) fine (PM1 and PM2.5), (b) PM10, and (c) coarse PM spectra from summertime\n(yellow) and wintertime (blue) Krakow and Magadino. More broadly, over all sites and seasons, oxygenated\nfragments\nconstituted 60 ± 2% of the HR spectra from water extracts, and\ntheir OM/OC ratio also remained stable (2.03 ± 0.05). Acetone\nextracts attributed 48 ± 5% to C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments, and the OM/OC was considerably\nlower across seasons and sites (1.6 ± 0.09) (Figure S16). Thus, acetone- and water-based sample extractions\nindicated a certain solubility bias that would benefit a more targeted\nanalysis of select OA constituents. On the other hand, methanol extracts\ncaptured variations in OA composition over a broader range of C\nx\nH\ny\n (37–54%),\noxygenated fragments (41 – 58%), and OM/OC (1.8 ± 0.14). Several key ions were also enhanced in organic solvents (Figures \n and S17–S19). The small hydrocarbon fragments\nincluding C2H3\n+, C2H5\n+, C3H5\n+, C3H7\n+, C4H7\n+, C4H9\n+, C5H7\n+, C5H9\n+, and\nC5H11\n+ increased by a factor of 1.5–60\nin spectra from both Krakow and Magadino. The oxygenated fragments\n(e.g., C2H4O2\n+, C2H5O2\n+, among others) were\ncomparatively less yet clearly enhanced (1.2–2.7). Within each\ncategory of fragment species (e.g., C\nx\nH\ny\n, C\nx\nH\ny\nO\nz\n), higher molecular\nweight ions showed greater enhancement than smaller ones, likely due\nto higher hydrophobicity and increased solubility of larger-molecular-weight\nspecies from hydrocarbon-like OA. However, reduced nitrogen-containing\nfragments exhibited a mixed behavior. C3H8N+ and C3H9N+ that are known\ntracers of cigarette smoke increased considerably (1.5–6),\nwhile CHN+ and CH4N+ were comparable\nin methanol and water but reduced in acetone extracts. Similarly,\nsulfur-containing fragments −CHSO+ and CH3SO2\n+ were reduced by 1–2 orders of magnitude\nin organic solvents (Figures \n, S17 and S18). Consequently, it\nmay be more difficult with SOff-AMS to apportion sources traced via\nthese fragments (e.g., methanesulfonic acid; marine SOA), yet possible\nwith clean backgrounds and application of other potential markers\nthat might be enhanced. The signal enhancement with molecular\nweight was also observed\nin the UMR region of the spectra, which was dominated by PAHs. The\nsignal increased consistently from m/z 128 (4–5) to 252 (40–60) for winter OA in organic\nsolvents. Acetone extracts showed slightly higher ion signal than\nmethanol in this mass range due to lower polarity.\n,\n Summer samples also showed a similar trend for all fragment categories\nbut with weaker enhancement relative to winter (Figures \n and S17), likely\ndue to reduced contributions from PAHs. The magnitude and composition\nof coarse PM were calculated as the\ndifference between the spectra of PM10 and fine PM. While\nOCcoarse was within the measurement error of OCfine for the winter samples indicating minimal to no coarse contributions,\nsignificant coarse OC was observed during summer (Krakow: 1.5 μg/m3, Magadino: 0.3 μg/m3 in methanol extracts).\nThus, we focus the discussion on summertime coarse OA (Figures \nc and S17). At both locations, mainly select hydrocarbon fragments\nwere considerably enhanced in methanol and acetone extracts relative\nto water, with a stronger increase for saturated (C4H9\n+, C5H11\n+, C3H7\n+) than for unsaturated fragments\n(C4H7\n+, C5H9\n+). The enhancement in acetone was a factor of 3–5\nhigher than in methanol. Consequently, observations over a larger\nsample size can likely differentiate sources of coarse PM between\ndifferent measurement locations. The limitations of using water\nas an extraction solvent are clear\nfor winter OA, which produced very similar spectra for Krakow and\nMagadino despite differences in sources between the sites (Figures S13d, S20, and S21). Water extracts summertime OA more effectively than winter, which\nis also evidenced by their increased OC solubility (Figure \n). For these samples, the HR\nspectra (i.e., m/z ≤ 150) constituted >95%\nof the OA mass across all solvent extracts, 50–60% of which\nwere contributed by oxygenated fragments (C\nx\nH\ny\nO and C\nx\nH\ny\nO>1). We\nalso compared our offline analyses of Krakow fine OA with measurements\nfrom a colocated online Q-ACSM that can be considered real-time characterization\nfor our purposes in this study. The SOff-AMS\nspectra were integrated to unit mass resolution and renormalized after\nexcluding large ions (m/z 126–467)\nsince the Q-ACSM measured only up to m/z 125. This comparison should be treated with caution due to differences\nbetween AMS and Q-ACSM instruments. First, the longer sample/background\nswitching interval of Q-ACSM instruments increases the importance\nof slow vaporization processes in the mass spectrum, which can enhance\nthe contributions of ions such as m/z 44. Comparison of m/z > ∼100 should also be treated with\ncaution\ndue to the uncertainty in estimated m/z transmission function of the Q-ACSM, which may cause systematic\nunder/overestimation of ions at high m/z relative to low m/z. Different\nsampling cutoff sizes (AMS: PM2.5 vs Q-ACSM: PM1) could also potentially affect the OA spectra, though minimal under\npolluted conditions. Therefore, the Q-ACSM\nspectrum should not be considered a “gold standard”\ncomparison for SOff-AMS data; nonetheless, comparison remains instructive. The methanol extract and Q-ACSM spectra were highly comparable\nduring winter (cosine: 16–17°) with similar fractions\nof total signal at m/z 44 (f44: 0.03 vs ACSM: 0.06), 43 (f43: 0.05 vs 0.08),\nand 60 (f60: 0.01 vs 0.01) (Figure \na). The acetone and water extracts were slightly\nless comparable, though not entirely dissimilar (cosine: acetone 21°,\nwater 23°) (Figures S22–S24). Comparisons of the (a) wintertime and (b) summertime Krakow PM1 OA spectra analyzed via SOff-AMS of methanol sample extract\nin the laboratory vs directly measured on site using a Q-ACSM. The\nOA spectra of Krakow PM1 samples measured in the laboratory\nfrom methanol and water-based sample extractions are compared for\n(c) winter- and (d) summertime conditions. Summertime ACSM spectra were similar to the water\nextract (cosine:\n18–22°), while methanol (28–30°) and acetone\nextracts (cosine > 40°) were considerably dissimilar (Figures \nd and S22 and 23). The similarity with water extract\nwas strongly influenced by high signals at m/z 28 and 44 in ACSM spectra during summer. Upon excluding\nthese ions (and the derived fragment ions 16, 17, 18), the ACSM spectra\ncompared similarly to water (22–28°) as to methanol (22–24°)\nand acetone extracts (∼29°). We showed that SOff-AMS can characterize significantly larger mass\nfraction of wintertime OA with substantial primary- and less-aged\nsource contributions in comparison to water extracts. Furthermore,\nthe SOff-AMS spectra can replicate real-time measurements of ambient\nOA, demonstrating that characterization close to online-level can\nbe achieved in offline laboratory-based measurements. Despite potential\nartifacts from sampling, incomplete solubility, and solvent interactions,\nthe strong agreement between SOff-AMS and Q-ACSM measurements supports\nthe reliability of SOff-AMS for OA characterization. The repeat analyses\nafter 36 h also confirmed the stability of OA spectra in solvent extracts\n(Figure S25). Nevertheless, large-scale\nintercomparisons will be important to further evaluate its performance\nacross diverse environments, sampling, and analysis periods. SOff-AMS\nenhanced the detection of several key markers of anthropogenic and\nbiogenic sources in OA spectra, which can be coupled with source apportionment\ntechniques to constrain sources of fresh ambient OA as well as other\nminor sources. For example, methanol extracts of Krakow winter OA\nnot only showed markedly higher small hydrocarbon contributions relative\nto water extracts but also a substantially higher concentration of\nfragments typically related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs:\n128, 152, 165, 178, 189, 202, 215, 226, 239, 252, and 276) (Figures \n and S15).\n,\n This is consistent\nwith Krakow being strongly affected by fresh and only slightly aged\nresidential coal combustion and wood burning emissions. Wood is the\ndominant solid fuel in wintertime Magadino, so the impact of hydrocarbons\nand PAHs was expectedly smaller (Figure \n) since wood burning emits less PAHs than\ncoal combustion.\n,\n This differentiation is crucial\nfor constraining the relative importance of sources in Krakow, Magadino,\nand other areas that are impacted by fresh combustion and other nonwater-soluble\nemissions.\n, Mass spectra of wintertime fine OA from\nKrakow and Magadino measured\nvia (a) methanol-SOff-AMS and (b) water-Off-AMS. Each spectrum combines\nhigh-resolution (≤m/z 150,\ncolored) and UMR (>m/z 152, black)\nion signals stacked on integer m/z values. (c, d) UMR spectra comparing the prevalence of higher molecular\nweight fragments in wintertime PM10 OA between Krakow and\nMagadino measured via (c) methanol-SOff-AMS and (d) water-Off-AMS.\nThe pie charts (inset c, d) show the fraction of extracted aerosol\nmass of PM10 for m/z ≤ 150 and m/z > 150. In the absence of a detectable amount of OCcoarse in\nwinter, we focused on the chemical composition of summertime coarse\nOA (Figures \n and S26). In general, acetone extracted a higher\nfraction (60–100%) than methanol and water extracts (35–49%)\nof the OCcoarse measured directly with the Sunset OC analyzer.\nPrevious work based on water extracts has established that AMS fingerprints\nof primary biological organic aerosol such as pollen and fungal spores\nexhibit characteristic peaks C2H5O2\n+ and C2H4O2\n+ with approximately similar intensity in the aerosol spectra. We\nfound this pattern in coarse OA from summertime Krakow and Magadino\nin both methanol and water extracts, however, with different C2H5O2\n+/C2H4O2\n+ ratios. Overall, the spectra showed\nclear differences between the extracts, as shown in Figure \n. Negative peaks at CH2O+, CH3O+, and CH4O+ for methanol extracts are the dominant peaks in solvent\nblanks and are removed due to their high uncertainty. The coarse OA\nspectra from water extracts were characterized by a higher prevalence\nof oxygenated fragments relative to methanol extracts that showed\na stronger presence of C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments. This suggests that SOff-AMS can characterize\nprimary coarse OA to potentially constrain both natural and anthropogenic\nsources (e.g., plastics). Summertime high-resolution mass spectra of coarse\nOA from Krakow\nand Magadino extracted in (a) methanol and (c) water. (b–d)\nComparisons between normalized mass spectra of coarse OA from (b)\nKrakow and (d) Magadino extracted in methanol and water. CH2O+, CH3O+, and CH4O+ are blanked since those are solvent-related peaks (Figure S8). In summary, SOff-AMS is a transferable analytical\nprotocol that\ncan be widely used to comprehensively characterize ambient OA from\ndiverse areas including where in situ online measurements may not\nbe feasible due to cost and logistical considerations. It can also\nhelp investigate the composition and sources of coarse and other larger\nparticles that are typically not accessible via online AMS measurements.\n\n## Calibration and Limits of Detection\nFive-point calibrations were performed for all solvents using mixes\nprepared with levoglucosan and inorganic standards (ammonium nitrate\nand ammonium sulfate) (Figures \n and S1). The mixes were spiked\nwith the internal standard, nebulized, and measured using the same\nmethod as for sample extracts. The calibration slopes showed 80–90%\nrecovery of the injected concentrations for inorganic standards. The\nslope of the levoglucosan calibration was used to determine the corrected\norganic RIE (RIEorg * c) as discussed\npreviously (this correction is already applied in Figure \na, yielding data in good agreement\nwith the 1:1 line). With the corrected RIE applied, OCams compared well with the reference OC measured\nusing the TOC analyzer. The solvent background-subtracted levoglucosan\nspectra were strongly similar across solvents (cosine angles: 9–13°)\nwith strong signals at characteristic m/z 60 and 73 contributed by C2H4O2\n+ and C3H5O2\n+ fragments (Figure \n).\n,\n Ion intensities of small molecular weight\nfragments (<m/z 80) including\nC\nx\nH\ny\n and other\noxygenated ions that formed majority of the total spectra were also\ncomparable between all solvents (Figure S2). Some differences were observed beyond m/z > 80; larger C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments were more prominent in methanol and acetone\nextracts relative to water, while oxygenated ions showed higher signal\nin water relative to acetone and were comparable in methanol. These\nions constituted less than 1% of the total spectra. Artifacts introduced\nby imperfect solvent background subtractions were evaluated by comparing\nthe resulting levoglucosan mass spectra to a best-estimate spectrum.\nThe best-estimate spectrum was calculated as the average spectrum\nof the three solvents for the highest levoglucosan concentration (6\nμg mL–1). For each fragment ion, data from\nsolvents exhibiting background subtraction imperfections, such as\nresidual solvent signals at low levoglucosan concentrations, were\nexcluded. Thereby, we found that mainly fragment ions that are major\ncontributors to the solvent background were affected in the levoglucosan\nmass spectrum (Figures S3 and S4), with\nspecific influences from acetone (C2H3O+- and CO2-related peaks), methanol (CH3O+), and water (CO2\n+). However,\nthese effects had only a minor impact on the OM/OC ratio (within 4%\nof the best-estimate value: Figure S5)\nand the determined mass concentration (within 10% of the true concentration: Figure S6). Furthermore, we also investigated\nsolvent removal from four mixtures containing different concentrations\nof inorganic standards (2–5 μg mL–1 NH4\n14NO3; 2.5 μg mL–1 NH4\n15NO3; 2–5 μg mL–1 NH4\n32SO4; 2.5 μg\nmL–1 NH4\n34SO4)\nthat showed no considerable change in organic aerosol detected by\nthe AMS (∑\nm/z\n\nI\nAMS,i,m/z\n)\nwith increasing salt concentrations (Figure S7). The levels of OCams for spiked solvent procedural\nblanks\nwere 1.4 μg mL–1 (29 μg) in acetone,\n0.6 μg mL–1 (11 μg) in methanol, and\n0.2 μg mL–1 (4.9 μg) in water. Based\non these analyses, we estimate the procedural limits of detection\n(LoDSB, defined here as 3 standard deviations of the spiked\nsolvent procedural blank) of OCams were 0.8 μg mL–1 (16 μg) in acetone, 0.15 μg mL–1 (3 μg) in methanol, and 0.2 μg mL–1 (4 μg) in water. Without solvent background subtraction, the\nmeasured OCams of filter blanks (FB) were comparable for\nmethanol (0.6 μg mL–1:11 μg) and 1.7\ntimes higher for acetone (2.5 μg mL–1: 50\nμg) and 1.5 times higher for water (0.3 μg mL–1: 7 μg). Thus, the procedural blanks dominated the OCams measured for the filter blanks. The LoDFB of OCams was defined here as 3 standard deviations of the filter blank analyses,\ni.e., it describes the minimum amount of OCams required\nfrom an atmospheric aerosol filter sample. LoDFB was 1.3\nμg mL–1 (26 μg) in acetone, 0.03 μg\nmL–1 (0.6 μg) in methanol, and 0.05 μg\nmL–1 (1 μg) in water. These were substantially\nlower than the sample with the lowest solvent background-subtracted\nOCams (PM2.5 Magadino summer) with 3.9 μg\nmL–1 (78 μg) in acetone, 4.2 μg mL–1 (83 μg) in methanol, and 3.4 μg mL–1 (68 μg) in water. Each solvent showed\na distinct mass spectrum dominated by its own\nfragments. While C2H3O+ and C3H6O+ were prominent in acetone spectra\nalongside some C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments, methanol spectra showed strong prevalence of CH3O+, CH4O+, and CHO+ ions (Figure S8). Several C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments were commonly\nobserved in acetone, methanol, and water indicating contamination\nartifacts, though minor. The spectra of filter blank extracts prior\nto solvent background subtraction were also very similar to spiked\nsolvents (Figure S9). These factors further\nsupport that the filter material had a minor influence on the measurement\nbackground, which mainly originated from impurities in solvents or\nthe experimental setup. Henceforth, all analyses are filter blank\ncorrected unless stated otherwise. Methanol is frequently used for\nsample extractions in other analytical techniques and is shown to\nextract diverse chemical species given a midrange polarity index of\n0.7.\n,,\n It also has\nconsiderably lower vapor pressure than acetone (boiling points: 64.7\n°C methanol vs 56 °C acetone) that prevents samples from\nuncontrolled concentrating via solvent evaporation prior to being\nnebulized into the spray chamber. For these reasons, we focus the\ndiscussion on methanol while providing analogous comparisons for acetone-\nand water-based measurements.\n\n## Bulk OC Solubilities of Ambient OA\nThe bulk OC solubility was measured directly from the AMS for all\nsolvent extracts as OCams using eq \n and also via the nonpurgeable organic carbon\n(NPOC) analysis of water extracts. All summer and Magadino winter\nwater extracts showed high NPOC content, while Krakow winter samples\nwere less soluble (Figure \n). Overall, the water solubilities of samples analyzed in\nthis study were largely representative of other days in the same season\nfor each site (Figures \n and S10). Furthermore, while the OC solubility\nin wintertime Krakow was lower than in other regions in Europe, mainly\ndue to high coal combustion for residential heating, the solubilities\nof summertime Krakow and all Magadino samples were comparable to other\nEuropean sites.\n−\n\n The contributions of dominant OA sources in Krakow\nand Magadino, i.e., HOA, solid-fuel combustion-related primary OA,\nand oxygenated OA, were also similar to other European locations (Figure S11). Thus, the samples investigated in\nthis study represented typical OA source profiles and bulk OA water\nsolubility across Europe and likely also to other regions, e.g., Asia.\n,, Fractions of organic carbon extracted\nfrom filter samples in acetone\n(red), methanol (blue), and water (light green) extracts measured\nvia SOff-AMS. The NPOC fraction in water extracts is also shown (dark\ngreen). Black star markers indicate season-based slopes of WSOC vs\nOC distributions for all fine PM samples collected in Krakow and Magadino\n(Figure S10). On the x-axis, the samples are labeled denoting sites, particle sizes, and\nseasons in which the samples were collected. “MGD” (Magadino)\nand “KRK” (Krakow) are sampling locations. PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 are particle sizes, and “S”\nand “W” indicate summer and winter seasons. OCams for water extracts showed a comparable\ntrend to\nthat of NPOC, but all summer samples exceeded corresponding NPOC values.\nThe uncertainties in organic mass-to-organic carbon ratios (OM/OC)\nand field blank subtractions at low summer concentrations or loss\nof purgeable inorganic carbon (e.g., carbonates) during acid dissolution\nof sample extracts in NPOC analyses could explain the higher OCams. In general, OC was more soluble in organic solvents compared\nto water (OCams,os/OCams,w) (Figure \n). OCams,os/OCams,w ranged 1.1–4.2 for methanol and 1–5.2 for\nacetone extracts. For both sites, the ratio strongly varied between\nseasons and particle sizes. For fine OA, winter OCams,os/OCams,w (2.9 ± 1.6) was a factor of 2.5 higher than\nsummer (1.2 ± 0.2). For PM10 OA, the ratio increased\nto 3.3 ± 1.5 for winter and 1.3 ± 0.2 for summer samples.\nThe wintertime OC dissolved more in organic solvents, likely due to\nincreased contributions from hydrocarbon-like or other fresh aerosols.\nThis is further evidenced by a high fraction of elemental carbon in\nwinter samples (16–20%), suggesting major contributions from\ncombustion-based nonwater-soluble emissions (Figure S12). Coal combustion POA is an important source in Krakow\nduring winter that contributed 12% to fine OA, alongside 3% from biomass\nburning POA. The OC solubility of Krakow\nsamples enhanced by a factor of 2.8–3.2 in organic solvents\nrelative to water, suggesting substantially increased dissolution\nof coal combustion-related OA. Coal combustion did not contribute\nsignificantly to POA in Magadino, although biomass burning is an important\nsource.\n, The OC solubilities also varied between\nmethanol and acetone extracts.\nFor all winter samples, 53–57% of OCtotal was soluble\nin methanol exceeding 14–40% in water. The solubility increased\nfurther in acetone (67–91%) compared to methanol due to increased\ndissolution of nonpolar OA constituents. The relatively consistent\nsolubility of winter samples in methanol could be attributed to its\nmidscale polarity, permitting the extraction of diverse chemical species.\nAcetone and water have more separated polarities potentially causing\ndissolution of varying fractions of organic mass strongly depending\non OA composition. In comparison, summer samples showed high OC solubilities\nin all solvents including (70–95%) water, (80–120%)\nmethanol, and (80–130%) acetone due to greater oxygenation\nof constituting organic compounds. Overall, the bulk OC measurements\ndemonstrated that SOff-AMS can significantly enhance the OC mass fraction\nthat can be analyzed offline from filters, especially during wintertime\nconditions.\n\n## Solubility of OA Constituents in Organic Solvents\nVersus Water\nThe OA spectra differed between sites and seasons\ndepending on influencing factors including differences in precursor\nemissions, environmental conditions, ambient OA levels, and their\nsolubility in the extraction solvent. The spectra of OA extracted\nin organic solvents captured these differences more effectively than\nwater extracts since several mass fragment groups were relatively\nenhanced. The methanol and acetone extracts of winter OA were dominated\nby C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments\nthat constituted over 50% of the HR spectra with smaller contributions\nfrom oxygenated species (36–40%) (Figures S13 and 14). In contrast, only ∼30% of each spectrum\nfrom water extracts was constituted by C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments. For each winter sample,\nextracts in organic solvents produced largely comparable spectra that\nwere dissimilar to water extracts (cosine: 35–50°). In\nthe UMR region spanning m/z 151–467,\nwintertime OA spectra were substantially enhanced in organic solvents\n(Figures \n and S15). The UMR signal constituted 25–28%\n(methanol) and 27–30% (acetone) of the winter OA spectra in\nKrakow, which reduced to 6–7% in water extracts. For Magadino\nwinter, this fraction reduced to 11% in both methanol and acetone\nand was 7% in water extracts (Figure S13). The Magadino HR spectra were comparable across solvents. However,\nmethanol extracts were slightly more similar to water than acetone\n(<15 vs <20°). Overall, these observations indicated lower\nwater-insoluble primary source contributions (coal combustion and\ntraffic exhaust) in Magadino than in Krakow during winter. Enhanced contributions\nin methanol-SOff-AMS measurements relative\nto water-Off-AMS of key ions to (a) fine (PM1 and PM2.5), (b) PM10, and (c) coarse PM spectra from summertime\n(yellow) and wintertime (blue) Krakow and Magadino. More broadly, over all sites and seasons, oxygenated\nfragments\nconstituted 60 ± 2% of the HR spectra from water extracts, and\ntheir OM/OC ratio also remained stable (2.03 ± 0.05). Acetone\nextracts attributed 48 ± 5% to C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments, and the OM/OC was considerably\nlower across seasons and sites (1.6 ± 0.09) (Figure S16). Thus, acetone- and water-based sample extractions\nindicated a certain solubility bias that would benefit a more targeted\nanalysis of select OA constituents. On the other hand, methanol extracts\ncaptured variations in OA composition over a broader range of C\nx\nH\ny\n (37–54%),\noxygenated fragments (41 – 58%), and OM/OC (1.8 ± 0.14). Several key ions were also enhanced in organic solvents (Figures \n and S17–S19). The small hydrocarbon fragments\nincluding C2H3\n+, C2H5\n+, C3H5\n+, C3H7\n+, C4H7\n+, C4H9\n+, C5H7\n+, C5H9\n+, and\nC5H11\n+ increased by a factor of 1.5–60\nin spectra from both Krakow and Magadino. The oxygenated fragments\n(e.g., C2H4O2\n+, C2H5O2\n+, among others) were\ncomparatively less yet clearly enhanced (1.2–2.7). Within each\ncategory of fragment species (e.g., C\nx\nH\ny\n, C\nx\nH\ny\nO\nz\n), higher molecular\nweight ions showed greater enhancement than smaller ones, likely due\nto higher hydrophobicity and increased solubility of larger-molecular-weight\nspecies from hydrocarbon-like OA. However, reduced nitrogen-containing\nfragments exhibited a mixed behavior. C3H8N+ and C3H9N+ that are known\ntracers of cigarette smoke increased considerably (1.5–6),\nwhile CHN+ and CH4N+ were comparable\nin methanol and water but reduced in acetone extracts. Similarly,\nsulfur-containing fragments −CHSO+ and CH3SO2\n+ were reduced by 1–2 orders of magnitude\nin organic solvents (Figures \n, S17 and S18). Consequently, it\nmay be more difficult with SOff-AMS to apportion sources traced via\nthese fragments (e.g., methanesulfonic acid; marine SOA), yet possible\nwith clean backgrounds and application of other potential markers\nthat might be enhanced. The signal enhancement with molecular\nweight was also observed\nin the UMR region of the spectra, which was dominated by PAHs. The\nsignal increased consistently from m/z 128 (4–5) to 252 (40–60) for winter OA in organic\nsolvents. Acetone extracts showed slightly higher ion signal than\nmethanol in this mass range due to lower polarity.\n,\n Summer samples also showed a similar trend for all fragment categories\nbut with weaker enhancement relative to winter (Figures \n and S17), likely\ndue to reduced contributions from PAHs. The magnitude and composition\nof coarse PM were calculated as the\ndifference between the spectra of PM10 and fine PM. While\nOCcoarse was within the measurement error of OCfine for the winter samples indicating minimal to no coarse contributions,\nsignificant coarse OC was observed during summer (Krakow: 1.5 μg/m3, Magadino: 0.3 μg/m3 in methanol extracts).\nThus, we focus the discussion on summertime coarse OA (Figures \nc and S17). At both locations, mainly select hydrocarbon fragments\nwere considerably enhanced in methanol and acetone extracts relative\nto water, with a stronger increase for saturated (C4H9\n+, C5H11\n+, C3H7\n+) than for unsaturated fragments\n(C4H7\n+, C5H9\n+). The enhancement in acetone was a factor of 3–5\nhigher than in methanol. Consequently, observations over a larger\nsample size can likely differentiate sources of coarse PM between\ndifferent measurement locations. The limitations of using water\nas an extraction solvent are clear\nfor winter OA, which produced very similar spectra for Krakow and\nMagadino despite differences in sources between the sites (Figures S13d, S20, and S21). Water extracts summertime OA more effectively than winter, which\nis also evidenced by their increased OC solubility (Figure \n). For these samples, the HR\nspectra (i.e., m/z ≤ 150) constituted >95%\nof the OA mass across all solvent extracts, 50–60% of which\nwere contributed by oxygenated fragments (C\nx\nH\ny\nO and C\nx\nH\ny\nO>1). We\nalso compared our offline analyses of Krakow fine OA with measurements\nfrom a colocated online Q-ACSM that can be considered real-time characterization\nfor our purposes in this study. The SOff-AMS\nspectra were integrated to unit mass resolution and renormalized after\nexcluding large ions (m/z 126–467)\nsince the Q-ACSM measured only up to m/z 125. This comparison should be treated with caution due to differences\nbetween AMS and Q-ACSM instruments. First, the longer sample/background\nswitching interval of Q-ACSM instruments increases the importance\nof slow vaporization processes in the mass spectrum, which can enhance\nthe contributions of ions such as m/z 44. Comparison of m/z > ∼100 should also be treated with\ncaution\ndue to the uncertainty in estimated m/z transmission function of the Q-ACSM, which may cause systematic\nunder/overestimation of ions at high m/z relative to low m/z. Different\nsampling cutoff sizes (AMS: PM2.5 vs Q-ACSM: PM1) could also potentially affect the OA spectra, though minimal under\npolluted conditions. Therefore, the Q-ACSM\nspectrum should not be considered a “gold standard”\ncomparison for SOff-AMS data; nonetheless, comparison remains instructive. The methanol extract and Q-ACSM spectra were highly comparable\nduring winter (cosine: 16–17°) with similar fractions\nof total signal at m/z 44 (f44: 0.03 vs ACSM: 0.06), 43 (f43: 0.05 vs 0.08),\nand 60 (f60: 0.01 vs 0.01) (Figure \na). The acetone and water extracts were slightly\nless comparable, though not entirely dissimilar (cosine: acetone 21°,\nwater 23°) (Figures S22–S24). Comparisons of the (a) wintertime and (b) summertime Krakow PM1 OA spectra analyzed via SOff-AMS of methanol sample extract\nin the laboratory vs directly measured on site using a Q-ACSM. The\nOA spectra of Krakow PM1 samples measured in the laboratory\nfrom methanol and water-based sample extractions are compared for\n(c) winter- and (d) summertime conditions. Summertime ACSM spectra were similar to the water\nextract (cosine:\n18–22°), while methanol (28–30°) and acetone\nextracts (cosine > 40°) were considerably dissimilar (Figures \nd and S22 and 23). The similarity with water extract\nwas strongly influenced by high signals at m/z 28 and 44 in ACSM spectra during summer. Upon excluding\nthese ions (and the derived fragment ions 16, 17, 18), the ACSM spectra\ncompared similarly to water (22–28°) as to methanol (22–24°)\nand acetone extracts (∼29°).\n\n## Implications for Ambient Measurements\nWe showed that SOff-AMS can characterize significantly larger mass\nfraction of wintertime OA with substantial primary- and less-aged\nsource contributions in comparison to water extracts. Furthermore,\nthe SOff-AMS spectra can replicate real-time measurements of ambient\nOA, demonstrating that characterization close to online-level can\nbe achieved in offline laboratory-based measurements. Despite potential\nartifacts from sampling, incomplete solubility, and solvent interactions,\nthe strong agreement between SOff-AMS and Q-ACSM measurements supports\nthe reliability of SOff-AMS for OA characterization. The repeat analyses\nafter 36 h also confirmed the stability of OA spectra in solvent extracts\n(Figure S25). Nevertheless, large-scale\nintercomparisons will be important to further evaluate its performance\nacross diverse environments, sampling, and analysis periods. SOff-AMS\nenhanced the detection of several key markers of anthropogenic and\nbiogenic sources in OA spectra, which can be coupled with source apportionment\ntechniques to constrain sources of fresh ambient OA as well as other\nminor sources. For example, methanol extracts of Krakow winter OA\nnot only showed markedly higher small hydrocarbon contributions relative\nto water extracts but also a substantially higher concentration of\nfragments typically related to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs:\n128, 152, 165, 178, 189, 202, 215, 226, 239, 252, and 276) (Figures \n and S15).\n,\n This is consistent\nwith Krakow being strongly affected by fresh and only slightly aged\nresidential coal combustion and wood burning emissions. Wood is the\ndominant solid fuel in wintertime Magadino, so the impact of hydrocarbons\nand PAHs was expectedly smaller (Figure \n) since wood burning emits less PAHs than\ncoal combustion.\n,\n This differentiation is crucial\nfor constraining the relative importance of sources in Krakow, Magadino,\nand other areas that are impacted by fresh combustion and other nonwater-soluble\nemissions.\n, Mass spectra of wintertime fine OA from\nKrakow and Magadino measured\nvia (a) methanol-SOff-AMS and (b) water-Off-AMS. Each spectrum combines\nhigh-resolution (≤m/z 150,\ncolored) and UMR (>m/z 152, black)\nion signals stacked on integer m/z values. (c, d) UMR spectra comparing the prevalence of higher molecular\nweight fragments in wintertime PM10 OA between Krakow and\nMagadino measured via (c) methanol-SOff-AMS and (d) water-Off-AMS.\nThe pie charts (inset c, d) show the fraction of extracted aerosol\nmass of PM10 for m/z ≤ 150 and m/z > 150. In the absence of a detectable amount of OCcoarse in\nwinter, we focused on the chemical composition of summertime coarse\nOA (Figures \n and S26). In general, acetone extracted a higher\nfraction (60–100%) than methanol and water extracts (35–49%)\nof the OCcoarse measured directly with the Sunset OC analyzer.\nPrevious work based on water extracts has established that AMS fingerprints\nof primary biological organic aerosol such as pollen and fungal spores\nexhibit characteristic peaks C2H5O2\n+ and C2H4O2\n+ with approximately similar intensity in the aerosol spectra. We\nfound this pattern in coarse OA from summertime Krakow and Magadino\nin both methanol and water extracts, however, with different C2H5O2\n+/C2H4O2\n+ ratios. Overall, the spectra showed\nclear differences between the extracts, as shown in Figure \n. Negative peaks at CH2O+, CH3O+, and CH4O+ for methanol extracts are the dominant peaks in solvent\nblanks and are removed due to their high uncertainty. The coarse OA\nspectra from water extracts were characterized by a higher prevalence\nof oxygenated fragments relative to methanol extracts that showed\na stronger presence of C\nx\nH\ny\n fragments. This suggests that SOff-AMS can characterize\nprimary coarse OA to potentially constrain both natural and anthropogenic\nsources (e.g., plastics). Summertime high-resolution mass spectra of coarse\nOA from Krakow\nand Magadino extracted in (a) methanol and (c) water. (b–d)\nComparisons between normalized mass spectra of coarse OA from (b)\nKrakow and (d) Magadino extracted in methanol and water. CH2O+, CH3O+, and CH4O+ are blanked since those are solvent-related peaks (Figure S8). In summary, SOff-AMS is a transferable analytical\nprotocol that\ncan be widely used to comprehensively characterize ambient OA from\ndiverse areas including where in situ online measurements may not\nbe feasible due to cost and logistical considerations. It can also\nhelp investigate the composition and sources of coarse and other larger\nparticles that are typically not accessible via online AMS measurements.",
