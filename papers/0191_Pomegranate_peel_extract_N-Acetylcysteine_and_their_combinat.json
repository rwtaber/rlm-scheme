  "abstract": "Cadmium is a major environmental pollutant and a highly toxic metal. It was aimed to determine the effects of pomegranate peel extract (PPE), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) alone and along with\nOrnipural on cadmium-induced toxicity. Forty-six Wistar Albino male rats were divided into 6 groups and the groups were formed into healthy control, Cadmium group (5 mg/kg/day, oral),\nCadmium + Pomegranate peel extract (500 mg/kg, oral), Cadmium + N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg, oral), Cadmium + Pomegranate peel extract (500 mg/kg, oral) + Ornipural (1 mL/kg, subcutaneous)\nand Cadmium + N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg, oral) + Ornipural (1 mL/kg, subcutaneous). Cadmium accumulated heavily in both liver and kidney tissue. The administration of N-acetylcysteine and\npomegranate peel extract alone reduced cadmium levels in both tissues. N-acetylcysteine treatment prevented the increase in ALT and MDA levels by cadmium damage. N-acetylcysteine + Ornipural\ntreatment inhibited the increase in liver 8-OHdG level in the liver. N-acetylcysteine and N-acetylcysteine + Ornipural treatments prevented the reduced serum MMP2 level. N-acetylcysteine and\nPomegranate peel extract + Ornipural treatments significantly reduced the increased liver iNOS level in the liver. In conclusion, NAC therapy may be a successful treatment option for cadmium\ntoxicity. However, further research is needed on the effects of PPE and Ornipural combinations for the treatment of cadmium toxicity. In future studies, various doses of these treatment\noptions (with chelators) should be investigated for cadmium toxicity.",

The hematology parameters (WBC, RBC, hemoglobin (Hb), lymphocyte, monocytes, hematocrit) of the\nblood samples were measured with a hematology analyzer (Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics, Shenzhen, China). The blood samples were added to into serum and anticoagulant (K 3  EDTA)\ntubes and then they were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm and separated into serum and plasma. The biochemical parameters [Albumin (ALB), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST)] in the serums were analyzed with an autoanalyzer (Abbott, ci8,200, Jiangsu, China). Total antioxidant capacity, MMP2 and MMP9 levels in the serum/plasma samples, and TNF-α, 8-OHdG and\niNOS levels in the liver samples were measured by the ELISA reader (MWGt Lambda Scan 200, Winooski, VT, USA) in accordance with the methods of commercial ELISA kit (Bioassay Technology\nLaboratory, Shanghai, China).

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "As a heavy toxic metal that adversely affects human and animal health, Cd causes structural and functional damage to the liver tissue depending on the dosage and exposure duration [ 20 ,  21 ].\n\nThe liver MDA levels decreased in concomitant administration of NAC and NAC + Orn with Cd ( P ˂0.05,  Table 1 ). Ornipural has\nantioxidant ingredients such as L-arginine, betaine, and methionine, which positively affect antioxidant enzymes [ 41 ,  63 ]. N-acetylcysteine increases the level of intracellular antioxidant enzymes such as GSH and has scavenging effects on oxidative radicals [ 48 ]. The inhibition of the increase in the liver MDA level in this study may be due to the inhibition of the oxidative radicals of NAC and Orn. However, the main effect is thought to\nbe NAC.\n\nLipid peroxidation is an important mechanism of cell membrane damage, and MDA is produced during the oxidative degradation of lipids [ 20 ]. It may be\ncaused by changes in antioxidant system activities and a decrease in sulfhydryl groups (SH) and GSH level, and these formations cause Cd-induced lipid peroxidation by stimulating the\nprooxidative status [ 34 ]. In the current study, the serum TAC level statistically decreased in the Cd group from that of control group and its decreased\nlevel was improved by the combined use of NAC with Cd (Cd + NAC group). Total antioxidant capacity level may have decreased because Cd causes oxidative stress and its level may have improved\nto the normal value with the chelator and free radical scavenging effects of NAC [ 48 ,  53 ]. N-acetylcysteine may\nincrease antioxidant effects by increasing the intracellular GSH level and decreasing Cd uptake into tissues [ 48 ], and inhibiting reactive oxygen species\n[ 65 ]. In addition to this, NAC may have caused the elimination of free oxygen radicals and decreased the liver MDA level by increasing the serum TAC\nlevel.\n\nIn this study, no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in liver TNF-α. Cd increases the expression of inflammation-related genes by causing oxidative stress\nand NF-κB activation [ 47 ]. Cadmium stimulates inflammatory reactions and it has also anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects [ 33 ]. The variable effects of Cd on inflammation have been reported to be dependent on dose, cell type and duration of exposure [ 15 ,  30 ]. Although Cd at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg doses causes pathological damage in the intestines of mice, the TNF-α level was not\naltered [ 77 ]. The non-statistically significant increase in liver TNF-α levels in the Cd group can be explained by the insufficiency of the Cd dose.\n\n8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine is used to determine DNA damage, and the presence of reactive oxygen radicals contributes to the formation of 8-OHdG [ 74 ].\nIn the current study, Cd may have increased liver 8-OHdG levels by causing oxidative DNA damage. N-acetylcysteine + Orn treatment may have reduced Cd-induced liver DNA damage. Antioxidant\nproperties of Orn (especially betaine), PPE and NAC may have prevented oxidative DNA damage in the liver tissue [ 25 ,  26 ,  36 ,  41 ,  48 ,  63 ,  67 ].\n\nThe levels and activities of MMP2 and MMP9 are directly related to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix in various diseases in different tissues. Impairment of MMP activity can lead to\ndisruption of cell homeostasis [ 32 ,  62 ]. Cd (at a dose of 15 ppm for 20 weeks) reduces both MMP2 and MMP9 activity\n[ 43 ]. In another study, prolonged Cd exposure resulted in a decrease in metallothionein and MMP2 levels and an increase in the level of MMP9 [ 27 ]. In the current study, Cd decreased the serum MMP2 level although it did not change the MMP9 level. The antioxidant and cell regeneration effects of NAC\nand NAC+Orn treatments may have prevented the decrease in the MMP2 level.\n\nCadmium causes an increase in the NO level in both hepatic and testicular tissues [ 6 ]. The NO level increases with inflammatory reactions and heavy metal\ntoxicity [ 42 ,  46 ]. Nitric oxide, which is a free radical, interacts with the superoxide anion to form\nperoxynitrite with strong oxidant effects, and it causes further tissue damage. Cd causes an increase in the expression of iNOS and tissue damage by the weakening of the antioxidant defense\nsystem and the production of free oxygen radicals [ 46 ]. In the current study, the liver iNOS level increased with Cd exposure, and the increase was\nsignificantly reduced by concomitant administration of NAC and PPE + Orn with Cd. The PPE and Orn combination may have reduced the level of Cd-induced liver iNOS, due to the antioxidant, and\nanti-inflammatory properties and synergistic effect of PPE and Orn substances [ 4 ,  37 ,  76 ]. In addition, a similar decrease in the liver iNOS level was observed by the chelator, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of NAC in the present study [ 13 ,  73 ]. The fact that the iNOS level did not change in the NAC+Orn group such as NAC group, because it can explain by\nunreduced the liver Cd level in the NAC + Orn group.\n\nIn the current study, serum ALT level significantly increased, and AST level moderately increased after Cd administration. Alanine aminotransferase is an enzyme specific to the liver\nparenchyma and its level is increased in cases of hepatotoxicity [ 61 ]. In hepatotoxicity induced by 5 weeks of Cd administration in rats, the levels of\nALT and AST enzymes has increased. [ 17 ]. Another reason for the rise in the level of these enzymes is the stimulation of lipid peroxidation and oxidative\nstress [ 23 ,  40 ]. N-acetylcysteine treatment reduces inflammation, provides cell regeneration in the liver and\ndecreases ALT and AST enzyme levels in a dose-dependent manner [ 8 ]. In the present study, ALT level may have improved due to decreased lipid peroxidation\nwith NAC treatment.\n\nIn the present research, Cd levels were statistically high in liver and kidney tissues only in the Cd group, and Cd levels could not be reduced by Orn administrations. Cadmium tends to\naccumulate in the kidney and liver after absorption [ 21 ,  59 ]. It has been reported that NAC can act as a chelator\non heavy metals, such as mercury, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, and gold [ 58 ]. Likewise, the flavonoids in PPE have a chelator effect on metals in general\n[ 55 ], and the tannins in PPE have a chelator effect on cadmium [ 72 ]. Although L-arginine in Orn is used for the\ntreatment of kidney diseases, some researchers have stated that L-arginine and its metabolites cause kidney diseases by increasing serum potassium concentration [ 12 ,  51 ]. In addition, L-arginine is converted to citrulline, which accumulates in the renal tubules and then causes tubular disorders\n[ 51 ]. In the current study, NAC alone and PPE treatments may have reduced Cd levels in kidney and liver tissues with their chelator effects. The lack\nof the same effect in combination treatments with Orn may be due to the L-arginine in its structure; it may have disrupted tubular structure with citrulline accumulation and decreased Cd\nexcretion.\n\nThe Hb level may decrease with the decrease in the amount of iron in the blood [ 2 ] and the increase in erythrocyte destruction [ 22 ]. In the current study, Cd administration caused a decrease in the level of hematological parameters, especially in Hb concentration. This can be explained by the passage\nof immature erythrocytes into the blood as a result of Cd suppressing the bone marrow [ 10 ]. On the other hand, it suggests that the current treatments\nprotocols against Cd do not cause a significant change in blood parameters and they can be used safely cadmium toxication.\n\nIn conclusion, Cd is a major important pollutant especially for the human and animal health and its toxic effects should minimized. It was determined that the best treatment option was the\nuse of NAC in the current research. In addition, it has been observed that PPE and NAC+Orn treatments prevent the osteoporotic changes caused by according to the results of the\nhistopathological and morphological research (unpublished data). Therefore, NAC can be effective in reducing the level of Cd in human/animal and eliminating the toxic effects of Cd, whereas\nfurther research need on the effects of PPE and Orn combinations for the treatment of cadmium toxicity. In future studies, these treatment options should investigated with different doses and\nchelators for cadmium toxicity."

  "full_text": "Cadmium is a major environmental pollutant and a highly toxic metal. It was aimed to determine the effects of pomegranate peel extract (PPE), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) alone and along with\nOrnipural on cadmium-induced toxicity. Forty-six Wistar Albino male rats were divided into 6 groups and the groups were formed into healthy control, Cadmium group (5 mg/kg/day, oral),\nCadmium + Pomegranate peel extract (500 mg/kg, oral), Cadmium + N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg, oral), Cadmium + Pomegranate peel extract (500 mg/kg, oral) + Ornipural (1 mL/kg, subcutaneous)\nand Cadmium + N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg, oral) + Ornipural (1 mL/kg, subcutaneous). Cadmium accumulated heavily in both liver and kidney tissue. The administration of N-acetylcysteine and\npomegranate peel extract alone reduced cadmium levels in both tissues. N-acetylcysteine treatment prevented the increase in ALT and MDA levels by cadmium damage. N-acetylcysteine + Ornipural\ntreatment inhibited the increase in liver 8-OHdG level in the liver. N-acetylcysteine and N-acetylcysteine + Ornipural treatments prevented the reduced serum MMP2 level. N-acetylcysteine and\nPomegranate peel extract + Ornipural treatments significantly reduced the increased liver iNOS level in the liver. In conclusion, NAC therapy may be a successful treatment option for cadmium\ntoxicity. However, further research is needed on the effects of PPE and Ornipural combinations for the treatment of cadmium toxicity. In future studies, various doses of these treatment\noptions (with chelators) should be investigated for cadmium toxicity.\n\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nN-acetylcysteine was purchased from Pharmactive Co.

The hematology parameters (WBC, RBC, hemoglobin (Hb), lymphocyte, monocytes, hematocrit) of the\nblood samples were measured with a hematology analyzer (Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics, Shenzhen, China). The blood samples were added to into serum and anticoagulant (K 3  EDTA)\ntubes and then they were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm and separated into serum and plasma. The biochemical parameters [Albumin (ALB), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST)] in the serums were analyzed with an autoanalyzer (Abbott, ci8,200, Jiangsu, China). Total antioxidant capacity, MMP2 and MMP9 levels in the serum/plasma samples, and TNF-α, 8-OHdG and\niNOS levels in the liver samples were measured by the ELISA reader (MWGt Lambda Scan 200, Winooski, VT, USA) in accordance with the methods of commercial ELISA kit (Bioassay Technology\nLaboratory, Shanghai, China). In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the liver samples were analyzed in a spectrophotometer device (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 25 UV/Vis spectrophometer,\nShelton, CT, USA) according to the method of Ohkawa, Ohishi [ 49 ].\n\nThe cadmium analysis was performed according to the method specified in Kacar  et al .

Since the data did not show normal distribution, they were evaluated with the\nnon-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and  post hoc  Dunn-Bonferoni tests. However, since the measurement data were parametric, they were presented as mean ± SEM in the tables. A\nvalue of  P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n## Chemicals\n\nN-acetylcysteine was purchased from Pharmactive Co.

Ornipural has\nantioxidant ingredients such as L-arginine, betaine, and methionine, which positively affect antioxidant enzymes [ 41 ,  63 ]. N-acetylcysteine increases the level of intracellular antioxidant enzymes such as GSH and has scavenging effects on oxidative radicals [ 48 ]. The inhibition of the increase in the liver MDA level in this study may be due to the inhibition of the oxidative radicals of NAC and Orn. However, the main effect is thought to\nbe NAC.\n\nLipid peroxidation is an important mechanism of cell membrane damage, and MDA is produced during the oxidative degradation of lipids [ 20 ]. It may be\ncaused by changes in antioxidant system activities and a decrease in sulfhydryl groups (SH) and GSH level, and these formations cause Cd-induced lipid peroxidation by stimulating the\nprooxidative status [ 34 ]. In the current study, the serum TAC level statistically decreased in the Cd group from that of control group and its decreased\nlevel was improved by the combined use of NAC with Cd (Cd + NAC group). Total antioxidant capacity level may have decreased because Cd causes oxidative stress and its level may have improved\nto the normal value with the chelator and free radical scavenging effects of NAC [ 48 ,  53 ]. N-acetylcysteine may\nincrease antioxidant effects by increasing the intracellular GSH level and decreasing Cd uptake into tissues [ 48 ], and inhibiting reactive oxygen species\n[ 65 ]. In addition to this, NAC may have caused the elimination of free oxygen radicals and decreased the liver MDA level by increasing the serum TAC\nlevel.\n\nIn this study, no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in liver TNF-α. Cd increases the expression of inflammation-related genes by causing oxidative stress\nand NF-κB activation [ 47 ]. Cadmium stimulates inflammatory reactions and it has also anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects [ 33 ]. The variable effects of Cd on inflammation have been reported to be dependent on dose, cell type and duration of exposure [ 15 ,  30 ]. Although Cd at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg doses causes pathological damage in the intestines of mice, the TNF-α level was not\naltered [ 77 ]. The non-statistically significant increase in liver TNF-α levels in the Cd group can be explained by the insufficiency of the Cd dose.\n\n8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine is used to determine DNA damage, and the presence of reactive oxygen radicals contributes to the formation of 8-OHdG [ 74 ].\nIn the current study, Cd may have increased liver 8-OHdG levels by causing oxidative DNA damage. N-acetylcysteine + Orn treatment may have reduced Cd-induced liver DNA damage. Antioxidant\nproperties of Orn (especially betaine), PPE and NAC may have prevented oxidative DNA damage in the liver tissue [ 25 ,  26 ,  36 ,  41 ,  48 ,  63 ,  67 ].\n\nThe levels and activities of MMP2 and MMP9 are directly related to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix in various diseases in different tissues. Impairment of MMP activity can lead to\ndisruption of cell homeostasis [ 32 ,  62 ]. Cd (at a dose of 15 ppm for 20 weeks) reduces both MMP2 and MMP9 activity\n[ 43 ]. In another study, prolonged Cd exposure resulted in a decrease in metallothionein and MMP2 levels and an increase in the level of MMP9 [ 27 ]. In the current study, Cd decreased the serum MMP2 level although it did not change the MMP9 level. The antioxidant and cell regeneration effects of NAC\nand NAC+Orn treatments may have prevented the decrease in the MMP2 level.\n\nCadmium causes an increase in the NO level in both hepatic and testicular tissues [ 6 ]. The NO level increases with inflammatory reactions and heavy metal\ntoxicity [ 42 ,  46 ]. Nitric oxide, which is a free radical, interacts with the superoxide anion to form\nperoxynitrite with strong oxidant effects, and it causes further tissue damage. Cd causes an increase in the expression of iNOS and tissue damage by the weakening of the antioxidant defense\nsystem and the production of free oxygen radicals [ 46 ]. In the current study, the liver iNOS level increased with Cd exposure, and the increase was\nsignificantly reduced by concomitant administration of NAC and PPE + Orn with Cd. The PPE and Orn combination may have reduced the level of Cd-induced liver iNOS, due to the antioxidant, and\nanti-inflammatory properties and synergistic effect of PPE and Orn substances [ 4 ,  37 ,  76 ]. In addition, a similar decrease in the liver iNOS level was observed by the chelator, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of NAC in the present study [ 13 ,  73 ]. The fact that the iNOS level did not change in the NAC+Orn group such as NAC group, because it can explain by\nunreduced the liver Cd level in the NAC + Orn group.\n\nIn the current study, serum ALT level significantly increased, and AST level moderately increased after Cd administration. Alanine aminotransferase is an enzyme specific to the liver\nparenchyma and its level is increased in cases of hepatotoxicity [ 61 ]. In hepatotoxicity induced by 5 weeks of Cd administration in rats, the levels of\nALT and AST enzymes has increased. [ 17 ]. Another reason for the rise in the level of these enzymes is the stimulation of lipid peroxidation and oxidative\nstress [ 23 ,  40 ]. N-acetylcysteine treatment reduces inflammation, provides cell regeneration in the liver and\ndecreases ALT and AST enzyme levels in a dose-dependent manner [ 8 ]. In the present study, ALT level may have improved due to decreased lipid peroxidation\nwith NAC treatment.\n\nIn the present research, Cd levels were statistically high in liver and kidney tissues only in the Cd group, and Cd levels could not be reduced by Orn administrations. Cadmium tends to\naccumulate in the kidney and liver after absorption [ 21 ,  59 ]. It has been reported that NAC can act as a chelator\non heavy metals, such as mercury, cadmium, chromium, arsenic, and gold [ 58 ]. Likewise, the flavonoids in PPE have a chelator effect on metals in general\n[ 55 ], and the tannins in PPE have a chelator effect on cadmium [ 72 ]. Although L-arginine in Orn is used for the\ntreatment of kidney diseases, some researchers have stated that L-arginine and its metabolites cause kidney diseases by increasing serum potassium concentration [ 12 ,  51 ]. In addition, L-arginine is converted to citrulline, which accumulates in the renal tubules and then causes tubular disorders\n[ 51 ]. In the current study, NAC alone and PPE treatments may have reduced Cd levels in kidney and liver tissues with their chelator effects. The lack\nof the same effect in combination treatments with Orn may be due to the L-arginine in its structure; it may have disrupted tubular structure with citrulline accumulation and decreased Cd\nexcretion.\n\nThe Hb level may decrease with the decrease in the amount of iron in the blood [ 2 ] and the increase in erythrocyte destruction [ 22 ]. In the current study, Cd administration caused a decrease in the level of hematological parameters, especially in Hb concentration. This can be explained by the passage\nof immature erythrocytes into the blood as a result of Cd suppressing the bone marrow [ 10 ]. On the other hand, it suggests that the current treatments\nprotocols against Cd do not cause a significant change in blood parameters and they can be used safely cadmium toxication.\n\nIn conclusion, Cd is a major important pollutant especially for the human and animal health and its toxic effects should minimized. It was determined that the best treatment option was the\nuse of NAC in the current research. In addition, it has been observed that PPE and NAC+Orn treatments prevent the osteoporotic changes caused by according to the results of the\nhistopathological and morphological research (unpublished data). Therefore, NAC can be effective in reducing the level of Cd in human/animal and eliminating the toxic effects of Cd, whereas\nfurther research need on the effects of PPE and Orn combinations for the treatment of cadmium toxicity. In future studies, these treatment options should investigated with different doses and\nchelators for cadmium toxicity.\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTERESTS\n\nThe authors declared that there is no conflict of interest.",
