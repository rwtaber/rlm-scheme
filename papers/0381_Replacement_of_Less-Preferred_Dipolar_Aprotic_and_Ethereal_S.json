  "abstract": "Dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents\ncomprise just over 40% of\nall organic solvents utilized in synthetic organic, medicinal, and\nprocess chemistry. Unfortunately, many of the common “go-to”\nsolvents are considered to be “less-preferable” for\na number of environmental, health, and safety (EHS) reasons such as\ntoxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, or for practical handling\nreasons such as flammability and volatility. Recent legislative changes\nhave initiated the implementation of restrictions on the use of many\nof the commonly employed dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide\n(DMF) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), and for\nethers such as 1,4-dioxane. Thus, with growing legislative, EHS, and\nsocietal pressures, the need to identify and implement the use of\nalternative solvents that are greener, safer, and more sustainable\nhas never been greater. Within this review, the ubiquitous nature\nof dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents is discussed with respect\nto the physicochemical properties that have made them so appealing\nto synthetic chemists. An overview of the current legislative restrictions\nbeing imposed on the use of dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents\nis discussed. A variety of alternative, safer, and more sustainable\nsolvents that have garnered attention over the past decade are then\nexamined, and case studies and examples where less-preferable solvents\nhave been successfully replaced with a safer and more sustainable\nalternative are highlighted. Finally, a general overview and guidance\nfor solvent selection and replacement are included in the Supporting\nInformation of this review.",

      "text": "Solvents are an integral component within many industries, perhaps\nmost significantly in the paints and coatings sector, which makes\nup for ∼46% of global solvent use. The next largest sector\nis the pharmaceutical industry comprising 9% of global solvent usage,\nclosely followed by the adhesives (6%), printer inks (6%), and cosmetics\n(6%) industries. With respect to the pharmaceutical industry, organic\nsolvent use can account for up to 56% of the entire mass involved\nin the synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).1 If water is included in this same calculation,\nthen up to 88% of the mass of an entire process can be attributed\nto solvent.1 Many traditional solvents\nemployed in organic and medicinal chemistry have associated issues\nsuch as toxicity, environmental, sustainability, and safety concerns.2,3 Thus, reducing the volume of solvent used and using safer and more\nsustainable solvents are two key concepts that are in agreement with\na number of the 12 principles of green chemistry.4 It is the intention of this review to present credible,\ngreener, safer, and more sustainable alternatives to a number of dipolar\naprotic and ethereal solvents with known issues that are to the best\nof current knowledge, safer. Case studies that highlight the successful\nreplacement of problematic solvents in commonly employed synthetic\norganic chemistry with “greener”, more sustainable solvents\nwill also be discussed. Dipolar aprotic solvents are ubiquitous\nin organic chemistry due to their ability to dissolve a wide variety\nof materials (often including salts), their versatility as reaction\nmedia, and often low cost (e.g., anhydrous DMF could recently be purchased\nfor £46.60 for 1 L (>99% purity GC, ≤ 0.1% water)5 and anhydrous 1,4-dioxane could be purchased\nfor £90.40 for 1 L (>99.8%)).6 In\nbulk quantities (not anhydrous), both solvents can be obtained for\nas little as £0.01/mL.7 Another key\nfactor that encourages their widespread use includes the abundance\nand precedence of existing literature supporting their use in myriad\ntransformations and processes. Dipolar aprotic solvents, such as dimethylformamide\n(DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone\n(NMP), acetonitrile (CH3CN), acetone, and tetrahydrofuran\n(THF) are regularly encountered as reaction solvents in chemical transformations.\nA survey of research published in Organic Process Research\nand Development (OPR&D) showed that\nthe most popular dipolar aprotic solvents are DMF, acetonitrile, DMSO,\nand NMP, in that order.8 This is not a\nsignificant change from the order reported for the period of 2007–2012\nother than DMF and acetonitrile swapping places. DMAc was not listed\nin the top 25 solvents employed for 2019.8 Uptake of dimethyl carbonate was however noted and is a promising\nsign that more sustainable solvents are being considered as viable\nalternatives.9 A similar analysis was performed\nfor 2020 and analyzed solvent usage trends in three representative\njournals: OPR&D, the Journal of Medicinal\nChemistry, and Angewandte Chemie. Across\neach of the three distinct journals for the period of 2020, ethereal\nsolvents feature prominently comprised 22–25% of all solvents\nemployed. Dipolar aprotic solvents comprised 17–20% of all\nsolvents used with each class and were similarly represented in each\njournal, see Figure 1. See the Supporting Information for full\nsolvent usage analysis. It is the composition of each of these classes\nthat is of further interest. A closer analysis of each of the\nsolvent categories shows the differences between the particular ethers\nand dipolar aprotics that are employed in each of the three journals’\npublications. THF remains the most popular ethereal solvent across\nall three data sets. Diethyl ether, with its associated flammability\nhazards rendering it particularly unfavorable for large scale work,\ndoes not feature in the top 25 solvents employed in OPR&D in 2020, see Figure 2. Furthermore, it can be seen that alternative ethers such as 2-MeTHF\nfeature far more prominently in OPR&D publications.\nOf note is that 1,4-dioxane does not appear as frequently in publications\nin Angewandte Chemie and we surmise that this is\ndue to the reliance on 1,4-dioxane for cross-coupling in medicinal\nchemistry C–C bond forming reactions, and Boc protecting group\nremoval. When the same analysis is applied to the dipolar aprotic\nclass\nof solvents, it can be seen that publications in the process-scale\nfocused journal OPR&D employed CH3CN as the most common dipolar aprotic. This is in contrast to both J. Med. Chem. and Angewandte Chemie in\nwhich DMF is the most prominent, see Figure 3. One potential reason for this trend may\nbe that solvent selection in process chemistry and scale-up operations\ninvolves far more in-depth risk assessment, which may preclude DMF\nfrom use. This may be due to either physicochemical incompatibilities,\nfor example, DMF is known to be incompatible with sodium hydride,10 or due to regulatory concerns, which are described\nin the following section. Nearly half of all dipolar aprotic\nsolvent usages (with the exception\nof CH3CN) can be attributed to nucleophilic substitution\nreactions (SN2 and SNAr).9 Dipolar aprotic solvents are favored for SN2\nreactions as they do not hydrogen bond to nucleophiles as would a\nprotic solvent, thus promoting the rate of reaction.11,12 Use of dipolar aprotic solvents has also long been known to have\na potentially enormous rate enhancing effect for SNAr reactions.13 1,4-Dioxane, THF, NMP, and DMF are all considered\n“go-to” solvents in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling\nreactions.14,15 The popularity of the less polar\nethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and THF is in part due to their\nability to coordinate reactive species via hydrogen bond accepting\ncapabilities and Lewis basic character.15 Labeling solvents as “aprotic” has long been challenged,16 as a number of what are widely considered “aprotic”\nsolvents are in fact incompatible with very strong bases. Therefore,\nthe terms “dipolar non-hydroxylic” and “dipolar\nnon-hydrogen-bond donor” can also be found in the literature.16 For all their aforementioned advantages, the\nmajority of commonly employed dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents\npose significant concerns from an environmental, health, and safety\nperspective (EHS), the reasons for which are discussed in the next\nsection. The drive to find safer and more sustainable alternatives\nto dipolar aprotic solvents within the pharmaceutical industry has\nbeen a key activity for many years, and it was highlighted in 2007\nas a key research area by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical\nRoundtable (ACS GCI PR).3 The primary motivating\nforce for identifying alternatives for dipolar aprotic solvents is\ndue to the serious health concerns posed by these solvents such as\nreproductive toxicity (DMF, DMAc, NMP).2,17−19 These concerns have also been flagged under European Union Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation,\ncategorizing DMF, DMAc, and NMP as “substances of very high\nconcern” (SVHC).2,17−19 The authorization\nprocess helps to ensure that SVHCs are eventually replaced with less\nhazardous substances where “technically and economically feasible\nalternatives are available”.20 Restrictions\ndiffer in that they are limits or bans on the use of a substance due\nto unacceptable environmental health and safety risks.21 NMP is restricted for use under REACH Annex\nXVII (substances for which certain uses are Restricted)22 due to its reproductive toxicity.17 Annex XVII restrictions as of May 2020 limit\nthe sale of NMP on the marketplace as solutions of concentration >0.3%,\nunless relevant chemical safety reports, data sheets, risk management,\nand appropriate operating conditions for downstream workers are provided.22 DMF and DMAc have also been placed on the candidate\nlist of substances of very high concern;23 the intention of the candidate list is for further restrictions\non use to be assessed for REACH Annex XVII restrictions.23 Similarly, DMF will be restricted from use from\nDecember 2023; specifically DMF “shall not be placed on the\nmarket as a substance on its own, as a constituent of other substances,\nor in mixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.3% after\n12 December 2023 unless manufacturers, importers and downstream users\nhave included in the relevant chemical safety reports and safety data\nsheets, Derived No-Effect Levels (DNELs) relating to exposure of workers\nof 6 mg/m3 for exposure by inhalation and 1.1 mg/kg/day\nfor dermal exposure.”24 Thus, the\nneed to seek alternatives to DMF is now absolutely critical. Thermal\nstability and potential safety hazards associated with the use of\nDMF as a reaction solvent have also recently been reviewed by Yang\net al., highlighting a multitude of potential thermal safety issues\nincluding thermal runaway and explosive decomposition.25 1,4-Dioxane is listed on the US Agency\nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a repository of\nhazardous substances and health effects.26 Both long- and short-term exposure effects are listed as possible\nincluding severe kidney and liver damage and carcinogenicity.26 As of July 2021, the European Chemicals Agency\n(ECHA) has added 1,4-dioxane to its “Candidate List of Substances\nof Very High Concern for Authorization”27 due to its carcinogenic properties and probable serious\neffects to the environment and human health, see Table 1. Thus, 1,4-dioxane is considered a “substance\nof very high concern” (SVHC).23 Solvent\nusage categories across three representative organic chemistry\njournals, 2020. Percent solvent use included as data label. Percentage solvent composition of the ether class. Percentage solvent composition of the dipolar aprotic\nclass.

Solvents arranged\nin\norder of decreasing ETN. Solvents not part of original publication\nbut scored according to published methodology. Solvents are color\ncoded according to a traffic light system where green = solvents with\nfew issues, amber = solvents with some issues, and red = solvents\nwith major issues.44 Categorization of\ndipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents by H-phrases according to the\nwork of McElroy et al.78 Note: Hazard phrases\nare those according to the “Harmonized Classification and Labeling”\nsystem as approved by the EU. See the Supporting Information (Unified Solvent Selection Guide for Dipolar Aprotic\nSolvents) Table S2 for a more in-depth\nanalysis of solvent H-phrase and occupational exposure limits. By 2023, the limit for 1,4-dioxane\nin personal care and cleaning\nproducts in the state of New York will be reduced to just 1 ppm, with\nthe expectation that similar laws will spread nationwide.28 THF is also believed to be a suspect carcinogen,\nsee Table 1. 1,4-Dioxane,\ndiethyl ether, and THF are also known to be peroxide forming solvents\nand are categorized as “Group B: Peroxide hazards on concentration”\nas noted in the review of safety guidelines for peroxidizable chemicals\nby Kelly.29 The hazards present when distilling\ngroup B solvents arise from the fact that the peroxides formed are\noften less volatile than the solvent being distilled; thus, the peroxide\nconcentration in the distillation flask can increase to dangerous\nlevels as the operation proceeds. The formation of peroxides can lead\nto potential explosions30 and can be triggered\nby friction from ground glass stoppers, leading to injury and even\nfatality.31 Peroxide formation can however\nbe mitigated by radical scavengers and stabilizers such as BHT.32 Issues associated with the use of diethyl ether,\naside from peroxide formation, include high volatility,33 low flash point,33 flammability,34 and explosivity.30 Furthermore, diethyl ether has formerly been\nutilized as an anesthetic36 and has been\nknown as a substance with a potential for recreational abuse as early\nas the 1800s.37 Other less commonly employed\nethers such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane are also known to be flammable,\nacutely toxic by inhalation, and to show reproductive toxicity.38 With traditionally employed dipolar aprotic\nsolvents coming under\nincreased scrutiny by legislative bodies, a time may come in the not\nso distant future that sees their use severely curtailed. Such a situation\n(albeit not for a dipolar aprotic solvent) has already been observed\nfor halogenated solvent dichloroethane (DCE).39 Special authorization is now required for the use of DCE\non an industrial scale. Furthermore, the permit, once granted, is\nonly valid for 4–12 years, on a case-dependent basis. The short-term\nnature of the permits is intended to drive the chemical industry to\nfind alternative solvents for DCE, which is a go-to solvent for much\nof the current pioneering academic research in C–H bond activation.39 Other factors that require consideration,\noutside of direct legislative\nconcerns, are how to dispose of dipolar aprotic solvents postreaction.\nOften, boiling points of dipolar aprotic solvents are elevated, see Table 1, making distillation\nand recovery challenging on scale, or indeed so energy intensive as\nto preclude this method of recovery.2 Instead,\nremoval from reaction mixtures can be achieved by aqueous workup.\nThe mixed aqueous–organic waste must then be safely and responsibly\ndisposed of, for example, by incineration unless biological wastewater\ntreatment has been shown to be possible. To overcome the challenges\nposed by the changing legislative landscape,\nand to answer the direct call from industry to find alternative solvents,\npioneering research has been conducted over the past ten years. Considerable\nprogress in identifying alternative solvents and reaction conditions\nfor traditional dipolar aprotic solvents has been made, and examples\nand case studies will be discussed in the next section. Recent years have seen\na flurry of activity to explore novel bioderived solvents. The major\ndriving forces for such interest, which are described in the previous\nsection, include legislative pressure, pressure to improve industrial\nsustainability, reduction in global carbon footprint, and a move away\nfrom petrochemical derived products toward those that are sustainably\nsourced. Many of these goals are encompassed by the UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals, for example, Goal 12: “Ensure sustainable\nconsumption and production patterns”40 and Goal 13: “Take urgent action to combat climate change\nand its impacts”.41 It should\nbe noted that the source of a solvent is just one aspect of its lifecycle.\nThe energy, water, and reagents, etc. used in the production of the\nsolvent should also be considered, along with its disposal, that is,\na life cycle assessment.42 Separate from\na full LCA (where this information is available), other aspects of\na solvent’s overall “greenness” that might be\nmore readily assessed include its biodegradability, volatility, and\ntoxicity. Multiple pharmaceutical companies, universities, and research\ninstitutions have attempted to score these attributes using multiparameter\nchemometric analysis, and a number of solvent selection guides have\nbeen produced including guides from Chem21,43 GSK,44 Sanofi,45 AstraZeneca (AZ),46 Pfizer,47 and the ACS GCI PR.48 Furthermore, computational tools49,50 and machine-learning51 have also been investigated to assist in the\nsolvent selection process. Other industries outside the realms of\nsynthetic chemistry, such as printed electronics, are also developing\nnew tools and methods in solvent selection for their selected specific\nneeds and applications.52 Over a\ndecade has passed since the call for finding replacement\ndipolar aprotic solvents was made by the ACS GCI PR.3 In the intervening years, a number of key advances have\nbeen made to tackle this challenge.2 Developments\nin the area of greener and more sustainable solvents are regularly\nhighlighted in the series “Green Chemistry Articles of Interest\nto the Pharmaceutical Industry” published a number of times\nper year by Organic Process Research and Development (OPR&D) since 2008.53 Original and inventive research utilizing surfactant–water\nchemistry, such as that championed by Handa et al. and Lipshutz et\nal., is challenging the very concept of employing organic solvents\nas reaction media. Instead, it is suggested that significantly important\ntransformations employed in medicinal chemistry, such as amide bond\nformation and metal catalyzed cross-coupling, can be conducted in\nsurfactant–water systems.15,54−59 Key developments have also been made in identifying and discovering\nnew dipolar aprotic solvents with improved safety, sustainability,\nand green chemistry criteria such as N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\npropylene carbonate, dimethyl isosorbide, and dihydrolevoglucosenone\n(Cyrene).2 Recently, new candidates such\nas diformylxylose have also been proposed as a replacements for traditional\ndipolar aprotics, though no toxicity studies have yet been conducted\non this solvent.60 Also of significance\nis the growing body of literature employing these alternative reaction\nsolvents and conditions. The growth of literature adopting greener,\nmore sustainable solvents is reinforcing the position that these replacement\nsolvents are genuinely an improvement on the current state of the\nart and are a credible alternative to the current status quo. EHS\nevaluations of these new solvents are also ongoing to avoid the potential\nsituation that a replacement solvent could pose toxic effects to the\nend user or detrimental effects to the environment.61,62 Avoiding the promotion of solvents that are just as bad or worse\nfor the user/environment has long been considered63 and remains critically important today. In the following\nsection, some of the recent advances made in identifying,\nto the best of our knowledge, more preferable, alternative solvents\nfor dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents are discussed in conjunction\nwith their production, physical, and chemical properties. It is the\nintention of the authors that these examples can be used as literature\ncase studies and for inspiration and guidance in making judicious\nsolvent selection in chemical processes. More esoteric technologies\nsuch as deep eutectic solvents and ionic liquids have purposely been\nomitted as they are topics requiring reviews of their own. A recently\npublished review by Gao et al. critically discusses replacement strategies\nfor dipolar aprotic solvents and includes both topics. We point the\nreader toward this review for further information.64 Tables of physicochemical properties,\nHansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and Kamlet–Taft (KT) parameters,\nhave been included as both a reference guide and to facilitate the\ncomparison and contrast of various solvents of interest. Plotting\nHSP parameters in a 3-dimensional space or sphere gives what is known\nas the “Hansen space”.65 Solvents\nthat are close in Hansen space can often exhibit similar solvency\npower. For example, solvents that were within 3 MPa1/2 of\neach other were identified as potential NMP and DCM replacements by\nPacheco et al.66 Chemometric tools have\nalso been developed to explore the Hansen space and to identify sets\nof greener solvents that could potentially be screened for their solubilizing\nproperties.67 HSP values can also be calculated\nfor solutes; the closer a solute’s HSP profile is to a known\nsolvent, the more likely it is to dissolve in that solvent. HSP values\nfor solvent blends can also be predicted predicted.68−70 Kamlet–Taft\nparameters describe linear free-energy relationships and are useful\nfor correlating solvent properties with reaction kinetics and processes\nin equilibrium.71 Dipolar aprotic solvents\ncharacteristically exhibit no hydrogen bond acidity (HBA) α\nwith the exception of acetone (0.06) and acetonitrile (0.19). Kamlet–Taft\nparameters can be plotted against each other to produce solvent maps\nthat highlight areas of similarity and difference between solvents\nand solvent classes, for example, see Figure 4. Methodology for replacing dipolar aprotic\nsolvents by using Kamlet–Taft parameters has been described\nby Duereh et al.72 Kamlet–Taft H-bond\nbasicity (β) plotted versus dipolarity\n(π*) for aprotic solvents (in purple) and protic solvents (in\ngreen).

The formation of peroxides can lead\nto potential explosions30 and can be triggered\nby friction from ground glass stoppers, leading to injury and even\nfatality.31 Peroxide formation can however\nbe mitigated by radical scavengers and stabilizers such as BHT.32 Issues associated with the use of diethyl ether,\naside from peroxide formation, include high volatility,33 low flash point,33 flammability,34 and explosivity.30 Furthermore, diethyl ether has formerly been\nutilized as an anesthetic36 and has been\nknown as a substance with a potential for recreational abuse as early\nas the 1800s.37 Other less commonly employed\nethers such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane are also known to be flammable,\nacutely toxic by inhalation, and to show reproductive toxicity.38 With traditionally employed dipolar aprotic\nsolvents coming under\nincreased scrutiny by legislative bodies, a time may come in the not\nso distant future that sees their use severely curtailed. Such a situation\n(albeit not for a dipolar aprotic solvent) has already been observed\nfor halogenated solvent dichloroethane (DCE).39 Special authorization is now required for the use of DCE\non an industrial scale. Furthermore, the permit, once granted, is\nonly valid for 4–12 years, on a case-dependent basis. The short-term\nnature of the permits is intended to drive the chemical industry to\nfind alternative solvents for DCE, which is a go-to solvent for much\nof the current pioneering academic research in C–H bond activation.39 Other factors that require consideration,\noutside of direct legislative\nconcerns, are how to dispose of dipolar aprotic solvents postreaction.\nOften, boiling points of dipolar aprotic solvents are elevated, see Table 1, making distillation\nand recovery challenging on scale, or indeed so energy intensive as\nto preclude this method of recovery.2 Instead,\nremoval from reaction mixtures can be achieved by aqueous workup.\nThe mixed aqueous–organic waste must then be safely and responsibly\ndisposed of, for example, by incineration unless biological wastewater\ntreatment has been shown to be possible. To overcome the challenges\nposed by the changing legislative landscape,\nand to answer the direct call from industry to find alternative solvents,\npioneering research has been conducted over the past ten years. Considerable\nprogress in identifying alternative solvents and reaction conditions\nfor traditional dipolar aprotic solvents has been made, and examples\nand case studies will be discussed in the next section."

      "title": "Recent Developments in Greener, More Sustainable\nSolvents and Reaction Methodology",
      "text": "Recent years have seen\na flurry of activity to explore novel bioderived solvents. The major\ndriving forces for such interest, which are described in the previous\nsection, include legislative pressure, pressure to improve industrial\nsustainability, reduction in global carbon footprint, and a move away\nfrom petrochemical derived products toward those that are sustainably\nsourced. Many of these goals are encompassed by the UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals, for example, Goal 12: “Ensure sustainable\nconsumption and production patterns”40 and Goal 13: “Take urgent action to combat climate change\nand its impacts”.41 It should\nbe noted that the source of a solvent is just one aspect of its lifecycle.\nThe energy, water, and reagents, etc. used in the production of the\nsolvent should also be considered, along with its disposal, that is,\na life cycle assessment.42 Separate from\na full LCA (where this information is available), other aspects of\na solvent’s overall “greenness” that might be\nmore readily assessed include its biodegradability, volatility, and\ntoxicity. Multiple pharmaceutical companies, universities, and research\ninstitutions have attempted to score these attributes using multiparameter\nchemometric analysis, and a number of solvent selection guides have\nbeen produced including guides from Chem21,43 GSK,44 Sanofi,45 AstraZeneca (AZ),46 Pfizer,47 and the ACS GCI PR.48 Furthermore, computational tools49,50 and machine-learning51 have also been investigated to assist in the\nsolvent selection process. Other industries outside the realms of\nsynthetic chemistry, such as printed electronics, are also developing\nnew tools and methods in solvent selection for their selected specific\nneeds and applications.52 Over a\ndecade has passed since the call for finding replacement\ndipolar aprotic solvents was made by the ACS GCI PR.3 In the intervening years, a number of key advances have\nbeen made to tackle this challenge.2 Developments\nin the area of greener and more sustainable solvents are regularly\nhighlighted in the series “Green Chemistry Articles of Interest\nto the Pharmaceutical Industry” published a number of times\nper year by Organic Process Research and Development (OPR&D) since 2008.53 Original and inventive research utilizing surfactant–water\nchemistry, such as that championed by Handa et al. and Lipshutz et\nal., is challenging the very concept of employing organic solvents\nas reaction media. Instead, it is suggested that significantly important\ntransformations employed in medicinal chemistry, such as amide bond\nformation and metal catalyzed cross-coupling, can be conducted in\nsurfactant–water systems.15,54−59 Key developments have also been made in identifying and discovering\nnew dipolar aprotic solvents with improved safety, sustainability,\nand green chemistry criteria such as N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\npropylene carbonate, dimethyl isosorbide, and dihydrolevoglucosenone\n(Cyrene).2 Recently, new candidates such\nas diformylxylose have also been proposed as a replacements for traditional\ndipolar aprotics, though no toxicity studies have yet been conducted\non this solvent.60 Also of significance\nis the growing body of literature employing these alternative reaction\nsolvents and conditions. The growth of literature adopting greener,\nmore sustainable solvents is reinforcing the position that these replacement\nsolvents are genuinely an improvement on the current state of the\nart and are a credible alternative to the current status quo. EHS\nevaluations of these new solvents are also ongoing to avoid the potential\nsituation that a replacement solvent could pose toxic effects to the\nend user or detrimental effects to the environment.61,62 Avoiding the promotion of solvents that are just as bad or worse\nfor the user/environment has long been considered63 and remains critically important today. In the following\nsection, some of the recent advances made in identifying,\nto the best of our knowledge, more preferable, alternative solvents\nfor dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents are discussed in conjunction\nwith their production, physical, and chemical properties. It is the\nintention of the authors that these examples can be used as literature\ncase studies and for inspiration and guidance in making judicious\nsolvent selection in chemical processes. More esoteric technologies\nsuch as deep eutectic solvents and ionic liquids have purposely been\nomitted as they are topics requiring reviews of their own. A recently\npublished review by Gao et al. critically discusses replacement strategies\nfor dipolar aprotic solvents and includes both topics. We point the\nreader toward this review for further information.64 Tables of physicochemical properties,\nHansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and Kamlet–Taft (KT) parameters,\nhave been included as both a reference guide and to facilitate the\ncomparison and contrast of various solvents of interest. Plotting\nHSP parameters in a 3-dimensional space or sphere gives what is known\nas the “Hansen space”.65 Solvents\nthat are close in Hansen space can often exhibit similar solvency\npower. For example, solvents that were within 3 MPa1/2 of\neach other were identified as potential NMP and DCM replacements by\nPacheco et al.66 Chemometric tools have\nalso been developed to explore the Hansen space and to identify sets\nof greener solvents that could potentially be screened for their solubilizing\nproperties.67 HSP values can also be calculated\nfor solutes; the closer a solute’s HSP profile is to a known\nsolvent, the more likely it is to dissolve in that solvent. HSP values\nfor solvent blends can also be predicted predicted.68−70 Kamlet–Taft\nparameters describe linear free-energy relationships and are useful\nfor correlating solvent properties with reaction kinetics and processes\nin equilibrium.71 Dipolar aprotic solvents\ncharacteristically exhibit no hydrogen bond acidity (HBA) α\nwith the exception of acetone (0.06) and acetonitrile (0.19). Kamlet–Taft\nparameters can be plotted against each other to produce solvent maps\nthat highlight areas of similarity and difference between solvents\nand solvent classes, for example, see Figure 4. Methodology for replacing dipolar aprotic\nsolvents by using Kamlet–Taft parameters has been described\nby Duereh et al.72 Kamlet–Taft H-bond\nbasicity (β) plotted versus dipolarity\n(π*) for aprotic solvents (in purple) and protic solvents (in\ngreen).

      "title": "Selection of Alternative\nSolvents",
      "text": "In this section, a selection of solvents that have\nbeen promoted\nas greener and more sustainable alternatives to traditional dipolar\naprotic and ethereal solvents will be discussed (Figure 5). An overview of their key\nfeatures and physicochemical properties that have made them attractive\nalternatives will be highlighted. Recent reclassification of the “greenness”\nof certain solvents such as sulfolane (due to reproductive\ntoxicity effects) are also noted. Specific examples and case studies\nhighlighting successful solvent replacements using these solvents\nwill be discussed later. Selection of proposed, greener, safer, more\nsustainable solvents. Cyrene, or dihydrolevoglucosenone,\nsee Figure 6, is a\ndipolar aprotic solvent that was designed as a potential alternative\nto common REACH-restricted solvents such as NMP and DMF.80 It is produced from renewable resources (accessed\nfrom cellulose in two steps, Scheme 1), can be considered as readily biodegradable, possesses\nlow acute oral toxicity, and has not demonstrated mutagenicity by\nAmes testing. Ocular irritation has however been reported.118 The Kamlet–Taft and HSP parameters for\nCyrene were calculated, and it was shown to occupy a similar Hansen\nsolvent space to NMP, see Table 2.80 HSP: van der Waals forces (δD),\npolarity (δP), and hydrogen bonding (δH). Kamlet–Taft:\nDipolarity/polarizability (π*), hydrogen-bonding acidity (donor)\n(α), and hydrogen-bonding basicity (acceptor) (β). Solvent\nordered by empirical solvent polarity, as in Table 1. Bio-based solvent\n“Cyrene”. Cyrene has been successfully employed as a solvent in multiple\ntransformations including palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions,14 acid chloride and amide synthesis,119,120 urea synthesis,121 MOF synthesis,122 and fabrication of water filtration membranes.123,124 For a review of Cyrene production and utilization, see Camp et al.125 The solubility of solutes in Cyrene has been\nshown to be dependent on the water content of Cyrene.126 An equilibrium between Cyrene’s ketone\nand a geminal diol form exists. Maximum solubility of solutes was\nfound to be associated with the presence of the diol form. These observations\nhave further led Cyrene to be considered as a solvent with potentially\ntunable or switchable properties.126 The\nuse of Cyrene with bases however must be appropriately considered\nas a number of inorganic bases react with Cyrene, catalyzing aldol\naddition. Furthermore, amines can react with Cyrene if heated, although\ntriethylamine at 30 °C has been found to be tolerated.127 The Cygnet class\nof solvents, Figure 7, refers to functionalized, ketal-protected variants of the previously\ndiscussed Cyrene.66 These derivatives are\nmore stable than the unprotected ketone Cyrene, and were purposely\ndesigned to act as more inert forms of the original solvent, given\nthat the ketone can be unstable under acidic conditions. The simplest\nCygnet variant, Cygnet 0.0, is functionalized such that the ketone\nis protected with ethylene glycol, with the higher variants protected\nwith derivatized ethylene glycol variants.128 Cyrene\nderived “Cygnet” family of solvents. Each variation can be prepared by condensation of the corresponding\ndiol with Cyrene in the presence of an acid clay catalyst, liberating\nonly water as a byproduct.66 Five variants\nof Cygnet have been synthesized to date, with their nomenclature based\non the number of carbon atoms in the chain attached to each of the\ntwo ketal carbon atoms (e.g., Cygnet 1.1 contains 1 carbon atom, a\nmethyl group, attached to each carbon of ethylene glycol). Because\nof the increased molecular weight of Cygnet derivatives compared with\nCyrene, the melting point of each solvent (e.g., for Cygnet 0.0, >\n70 °C) can lead to more difficult handling as a solvent. Of particular\ninterest is the use of Cygnet 0.0 as a solvent, given that the predicted\nHansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) place it in a similar part of Hansen\nSolubility Space as dichloromethane (DCM); however, alternatives\nto chlorinated solvents were the focus of a recent review by some\nof the authors of this work and are not covered here.8,66 To date, Cygnet 0.0 has been screened as a potential green solvent\nfor dissolution of polymers for NIPS membrane casting.128 Toxicity and mutagenicity testing is underway\nfor Cygnet 0.0, although Cygnet variants are predicted to be nontoxic\nand nonmutagenic.66 Cygnet 0.0 and Cyrene\nblends have been successfully utilized in the biocatalytic synthesis\nof polyesters, effectively replacing traditionally employed polar\naprotic solvents.129 Carbonate-based solvents\ncount dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl\ncarbonate, ethylene carbonate, and propylene carbonate, see Figure 8, among the most\npopular and widely used exemplars. Of the aforementioned solvents,\npropylene and ethylene carbonate score most favorably according to\nthe GSK solvent selection guide,44 though\ntheir elevated boiling points (242 and 248 °C, respectively)\nmay preclude their use in some applications. Depending on the polarity\nof the product, partitioning of high boiling solvents into an aqueous\nlayer followed by product extraction with an immiscible nonpolar solvent\ncan be achieved.2 However, this additional\nstep inevitably increases process mass intensity and waste generation\nvia the introduction of an additional solvent. Propylene carbonate\nsynthesis and production have been discussed by Forero et al. in their\nreview of propylene carbonate as a green solvent;130 multiple methods utilize CO2 as a carbon source\nin conjunction with other potentially renewable starting materials.\nPropylene carbonate occupies a Hansen solvent space close to acetonitrile,\nsee Table 2, giving\na rough indication of comparable solvating ability. Potential applications\nfor carbonate based solvents include, but are not limited to, metal\ncatalyzed cross-coupling reactions,107 proline-catalyzed\naldol reactions,131 hydrosilylation,132 cyanohydrin synthesis,133 proline-catalyzed hydrazination,134 amine-electrophile SN2 chemistry,135 and the Appel reaction.136 Some commonly\nemployed carbonate-based solvents. γ-Valerolactone,\nsee Figure 9, is a\nhigh boiling (207 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent and platform molecule137 that can be isolated from lignocellulosic biomass\nvia levulinic acid.138 Multiple reviews\nand methods of its production have been published; 128 patents mention\nGVL, and it is present as a product in 567 separate publications.139 GVL has enjoyed moderate uptake as a reaction\nsolvent across a wide variety of chemistry types. A search conducted\nusing SciFinder shows that GVL has been employed as reaction solvent\nin 750 reactions across 108 publications, more than three-quarters\nof which have been published since 2014.140 Applications of this solvent as a reaction medium including palladium-catalyzed\ncross-coupling,141 electrochemistry,142 lignin depolymerization,143 C–H activation chemistry,144 and solid phase peptide synthesis.145 The success and wide variety of applications in which GVL has been\nemployed are in part due to GVL’s favorable solvent properties;\nKamlet–Taft parameters are comparable to DMF and DMAc and COSMO-RS\nmodeling, and HSP comparisons have shown GVL to be most similar to\nacetone, NMP, DMF, and DMAc.146 Biodegradation\nstudies have shown GVL to rapidly and completely break down in aquatic\nenvironments, and it has been demonstrated to be less toxic to humans\nthat comparable dipolar aprotic solvents.146 Caution however must be taken when utilizing GVL as it is a known\nprodrug for γ-hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV), which itself has been\nnoted as an alternative for UK Class C drug γ-hydroxybutyric\nacid (GHB),147 possession of which is punishable\nby up to 2 years imprisonment. Therefore, it is the authors suggestion\nthat use and inventory/storage of this solvent be treated with caution\ndue to its sedative properties, potential for abuse, and potential\nfor future legislative restriction. Furthermore, due to the aforementioned\nconcerns, the authors have opted not to recommend GVL as a replacement\nsolvent in the condensed solvent selection guide provided in the Supporting Information (Unified Solvent Selection\nGuide for Dipolar Aprotic Solvents). γ-Valerolactone. Sulfolane, see Figure 10, is a high-boiling\n(285 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent developed by Shell, and it has\nseen use in industrial applications in gas and oil refining, for example,\nthe Sulfinol Process.148 Sulfolane can\nbe produced industrially via the reaction of SO2 with butadiene\nfollowed by hydrogenation of the intermediate sulfolene to give sulfolane.149 HSP values for sulfolane suggest that is has\nvery high solubilizing power for polar compounds, similar to DMSO,\nsee Table 2. Sulfolane\nalso possesses one of the highest Kamlet–Taft polarizability/dipolarity\nscores (π* = 0.90) of any of the solvents in Table 2, only DMSO is higher at 1.00.\nSulfolane’s hydrogen bond basicity β is much lower however\nat 0.39 compared to DMSO 0.76 and is closer to propylene carbonate\nin this parameter (π* = 0.90, β = 0.38). Sulfolane is\nimmiscible with alkanes and MTBE, which can allow for facile workups\nand product extraction of MTBE soluble products.149 Sulfolane has previously been considered as a safer dipolar\naprotic solvent including for the fact that sulfolane has a much lower\nskin permeability than DMSO, DMF, DMAc, and NMP.149 Sulfolane, however, has been identified as potentially\nmore hazardous than originally thought. A study on the reproductive\ntoxicity effects of sulfolane in rats has suggested that the solvent\ncould harm unborn child.150 Some SDS now\ncarry a H360 warning to reflect this evidence.151 Furthermore, sulfolane has been recategorized according\nto the Chem21 solvent selection guide from “recommended”\nto “hazardous”.43 Sulfolane\ncontamination of groundwater and drinking water was reported near\nthe oil refinery in the community of Fairbanks, Alaska.152 Thus, it is the authors’ recommendation\nthat sulfolane is not considered as a suitable green solvent. For\na review of reactions conducted using sulfolane, see Tilstam et al.149 Sulfolane. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran, see Figure 11, is an ethereal solvent that can be derived\nfrom renewable resources such as levulinic acid or furfural,153 which can themselves be derived from agricultural\nwaste such as corn stover, sugar cane bagasse, and rice straw.154 Life cycle assessment conducted on 2-MeTHF\nhas shown that production of the solvent from furfural derived from\ncorn-cob waste can reduce emissions by up to 97% when compared to\na traditional chemical synthesis of THF,155 though it is not always clear how individual supplies of 2-MeTHF\nare currently made. Structurally, 2-MeTHF differs from THF by the\naddition of one single methyl group, yet this addition is responsible\nfor several significantly different physiochemical properties. First,\nthe boiling point is elevated by 13 °C, see Table 1. 2-MeTHF is significantly less\nmiscible with water at room temperature (129.2 g/L)156 than THF (494.7 g/L).157 This\nimmiscibility has led 2-MeTHF to be employed as an extraction solvent\nand also as an organic component in aqueous–organic biphasic\nreaction mixtures.158 Interestingly, 2-MeTHF\nis also inversely soluble in water; at 0 °C, 2-MeTHF is 21 wt\n% soluble in water, whereas at 19 °C, this is reduced to 14 wt\n% and at 50 °C it is just 7.8 wt %.159 2-MeTHF is also more stable to acidic hydrolysis than THF and has\na longer t1/2 for R-Li mediated decomposition\nwhen compared to THF (130 min vs 10 min at 35 °C),158 though it is still susceptible to peroxide\nformation.160 As 2-MeTHF occupies a very\nsimilar solvent space to THF, see Table 2, it has been promoted as a “drop-in”\nreplacement for THF that is greener and more sustainable. A number\nof reagent solutions are now commercially available in 2-MeTHF such\nas Grignard and lithium reagents,161 further\npromoting their uptake as viable alternatives to THF and diethyl ether.153 Use of 2-MeTHF has seen gradual increase as\nnoted in the solvent use survey conducted by Ashcroft et al. (14%\nof publications in OPR&D for the period of 2009–2012 utilized\n2-MeTHF in some stage of the reported synthesis).9 Many reviews of solvents ignore price, as such information\ncan vary greatly depending on geography, purchasing contracts, or\ntime. However, it is instructive to note that a price comparison of\n2-MeTHF and THF was conducted in 2021 using Sigma-Aldrich’s\nwebsite, see Table 3. Search criteria used were anhydrous solvents containing 250 ppm\nbutylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) inhibitor and a purity of ≥99.9%.\nCost per liter of 2-MeTHF is nearly 2.5-times greater than standard\nTHF at the purity and grade that were considered. However, economies\nof scale come into effect at 200 L drum size; 2-MeTHF was only 13%\nmore expensive than THF. Depending on the details of the reaction\nconcerned, it is therefore easily conceivable that the increased cost\nof purchase could be offset by other reduced costs (e.g., less aqueous\nwaste for incineration). For further reviews of 2-MeTHF use, see Pace\net al. 2012,153 Monticelli et al. 2017,160 and most recently Bijoy et al. 2021.162 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran. Cyclopentyl\nmethyl ether, see Figure 12, is a hydrophobic ethereal solvent with a high boiling point\n(106 °C), see Table 1. It became a credible alternative to many ethereal solvents,\nsuch as THF and 1,4-dioxane, when commercial quantities became available\nin 2005.165 CPME can be produced from either\ncyclopentanol or from cyclopentene, see Scheme 2.165 The similar\nHSP parameters of CPME to other ethereal solvents (and their proximity\nto one another in Hansen space), such as 1,4-dioxane and THF, give\nan indication that CPME likely possesses similar solubilizing capabilities,80 see Table 2. CPME can be made from renewable resources, although\nit is not currently commercially available via a biobased route, and\noffers other benefits, including significantly safer handling and\nrelative stability under acidic and basic conditions.165 Peroxide formation is still an issue however,\nand butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is still required as an additive\nto prevent oxidation.165,103,166 Toxicological assessment of CPME was conducted by Watanabe et al.\nin 2013, and it was shown to have relatively low acute toxicity, and\nwas shown not to be a skin sensitizer nor a mutagen. Eye and skin\nirritation were however observed.167 The\npotential for this solvent to become a solvent for use in process\nchemistry was reviewed in 2007165 and more\nrecently in 2019168 where its position\nas a more sustainable, environmentally friendly ether has become reinforced.\nApplications where it has been successfully employed include organometallic\nchemistry, transition metal catalysis, acid catalysis, amidation reactions,\noxidations, radical reactions, and as an organic phase in biphasic\nchemistry.168 For specific examples, see\nreviews by Azzena et al.,168 Watanabe et\nal.,165 and most recently Bijoy et al.162 Cyclopentyl methyl ether. Methyl tert-butyl ether\n(MTBE), see Figure 13, sometimes referred\nto as tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME), is a volatile\n(bp 55 °C), flammable, colorless liquid that is commonly used\nas a fuel additive to reduce detonation risk in addition to reducing\nunwanted emissions.169 Similar to other\nethers, MTBE is often used in the place of THF and diethyl ether due\nto its significantly lower risk of peroxide formation, with the tert-butyl group thought to contribute to this.170 In comparison with other ethereal solvents,\nMTBE does, however, have a much lower flash point (−28 °C,\ncompared with −14.5 °C for THF and −1 °C for\nCPME), see Table 4.166 Furthermore, there have been some health concerns\nrelated to MTBE, with links to endocrine disruption.172 MTBE is synthesized industrially in a similar way to CPME,\nthrough the reaction of methanol (derived from natural gas), and isobutylene,\nsourced from the dehydrogenation of isobutane.173 Methyl tert-butyl ether. MTBE has\nbeen used as a solvent in reaction classes including C–H\nborylations,174 Suzuki-Miyaura couplings,174 palladium-catalyzed silyl enolate alkylations,\nand Sonogashira cross-couplings.175 It\nhas additionally been known to be used as an alternative greener solvent\nin normal-phase column chromatography,176 and as an alternative extraction solvent due to its immiscibility\nwith water.177 Unlike other ethers, the\nlow Lewis basicity of MTBE results in incompatibility with formation\nof Grignard reagents and limits use in lithiations. Both\ncyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, see Figure 14, have been promoted as alternative dipolar\naprotic ketone solvent replacements that can be potentially produced\nfrom biorenewable resources.178 Cyclopentanone\ncan be produced from the biobased platform molecule furfural,179 and cyclohexanone by catalytic reduction of\naromatic ethers such as anisole.180 Both\nsolvents score highly according to the GSK solvent selection guide\nas potentially greener and more sustainable ketone solvents for myriad\nreasons including favorable recyclability scoring, minimal known measured\naquatic impact, moderate to good exposure and health hazard scoring,\nand a good reactivity and flammability score.44 Both cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone have boiling points that are\nelevated (cyclopentanone 129 °C, cyclohexanone 155 °C (Table 1) and occupy a similar\nHansen solubility space to each other when comparing δD and\nδH. However, the polarity parameter or δP differs significantly;\ncyclopentanone is 11.9, whereas cyclohexanone is 8.4, see Table 2, suggesting that\ncyclopentanone is more polar than cyclohexanone. This is at odds with\nthe Reichardt polarity parameter (0.281 vs 0.269, Table 1). When examining the Kamlet–Taft\nparameters, cyclopentanone possesses a larger π* (0.76 vs 0.68)\nand both solvents have nearly identical hydrogen bond basicity β\nof (0.52 and 0.53). π* as a measure of dipolarity/polarizability\nis in agreement with the information provided by the HSP parameters;\ncyclopentanone is “more polar” by this measure than\ncyclohexanone. Cyclopentanone has been successfully employed as solvent\nin several processes. A SciFinder analysis of the literature shows\nthat 74 nonparticipating single-step transformations have been reported\nin 29 different journal publications.181 Uses include solvent in photoredox catalysis,182 aldol reactions (as both solvent and reagent),183 and solvent for Steglich-type thioester formation,184 transition metal catalysis,185 and total synthesis.186 Similarly,\ncyclohexanone has seen use in 1545 reactions in 421 journal publications.187 Uses include transition metal catalysis,188,189 aldol reactions,190 total synthesis,191 and as a general synthesis solvent in medicinal\nchemistry drug discovery.192 Aside from\ntheir use as solvents, both cyclic ketones have found significant\nuse as organic chemistry building-blocks; cyclohexanone is an important\nprecursor for Nylon-6.193 Cyclic ketones cyclopentanone\n(left) and cyclohexanone (right). TMO or 2,2,5,5-tetramethyltetrahydrofuran (TMTHF), see Figure 15, is a volatile\nnonpolar (VNP) ether that was identified as a potential replacement\nfor volatile and peroxide forming ethers and also toluene as part\nof the ReSolve project.194 Specific properties\nof a boiling point of <115 °C and nonperoxide forming characteristics\nwere required, and TMO fulfilled these criteria (bp 112 °C, Table 1) from a selection\nof other quaternary alpha-carbon ether hydrocarbons that were considered.103 TMO can be synthesized from 2,5-dimethylhexane-2,5-diol\n(which itself can be potentially produced from renewable resources)\nvia a dehydration reaction.103 Additionally,\na recent report by Byrne et al. compared a selection of biobased synthetic\nroutes to TMO from glucose, one of which included use of methyl levulinate\n(a byproduct of polyethylene furanoate production, Avantium).195 Each potential route was further analyzed by\na range of metric tools for comparison. 2,2,5,5-Tetramethyloxolane. TMO’s Kamlet–Taft parameters were\nmeasured and the\nHSP parameters calculated using HSPiP software. The Kamlet–Taft\nproperties showed that TMO had strong hydrogen bond accepting character\n(β = 0.77, Table 2) and a low polarity-polarizability character (π* = 0.35).\nAs per the other aprotic solvents, the hydrogen bond donating ability\nα was zero. In practice, however, the tetramethyl groups adjacent\nto the ether oxygen in TMO introduce significant steric bulk and essentially\nshield the lone-pairs, thus reducing their ability to accept hydrogen\nbonds. The effects of the steric hindrance are consistent with the\ncalculated HSP values, which show that TMO has a hydrogen bonding\nability (δH) of 2.1; for comparison, THF has a δH of 8.0,\nsee Table 2. The low\nδH value translates into real-world chemical reactivity effects.\nFor example, Byrne et al. have demonstrated that TMO is a poor solvent\nfor the formation of some Grignard reagents due to the poor accessibility\nof the oxygen lone-pairs (despite strong Lewis-acid characteristics).\nTMO was shown to behave more like hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene,\ngiving excellent rates of reaction in esterification and amidation\nreactions.103 TMO has also been assessed\nfor its potential as an extraction solvent in aqueous–organic\nextractions and was shown to be a particularly useful solvent in extracting\nhydrogen bond donating solutes from aqueous systems when toluene was\nnot.196 Pellis et al. have investigated\nthe use of TMO as an alternative solvent to toluene and THF in the\nbiocatalyzed polymerization of polyesters,197 and its resin swelling ability has been assessed by Yanrui et al.198 In a more niche use, TMO also performs effectively\nas a solvent for the oxidation of (hydroxymethyl)furfural to\ndiformylfuran.199 Eucalyptol is a naturally\noccurring bicyclic ether, see Figure 16, belonging to the monoterpenoid family, and is the\nmajor component of eucalyptus oil.200 The\nhigh-boiling liquid (176 °C) is insoluble in water and soluble\nin organic solvents including alcohols, ethers, and chloroform.201 Also known within the chemical literature as\n1,8-cineole, the oil is manufactured globally from tree species within\nthe Eucalyptus genus, with over 300 species known\nto contain the oil. These trees are commonly grown for the purpose\nof timber production, and the extraction of eucalyptol from the “waste\nleaf” from timber operations makes the source of the oil potentially\nsustainable.202 Pure eucalyptol is obtained\nfrom the “waste leaf” in a two-step process, distillation\nof harvested leaf with steam, followed by freezing of the crude material\nat −40 °C, with removal of unfrozen limonene impurities\n(usually 2–7%).202 Eucalyptol, like\na number of other dipolar aprotics solvents, is hygroscopic. The oil\nis known to have medicinal applications including potent anti-inflammatory\nand antioxidant properties.203 Because\nof its use as a medicine, in addition to a common food additive, eucalyptol\nhas been extensively tested and can be considered to have a low risk\nof toxicity.204 To date, very few publications\n(<10) have been reported using eucalyptol as a sustainable solvent\nfor organic transformations, although it has been shown to be an effective\nsolvent in applications such as transition-metal catalyzed C–C,\nC–O, C–N, and C–S bond formation205−207 in addition to carboxylations.208 Bicyclic\nether “eucalyptol”. Dimethyl\nisosorbide is a high boiling (235 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent,\nsee Figure 17, that\ncan be synthesized from biorenewable resources such as cellulose (in\ntwo steps via glucose and then sorbitol)209 or via direct methylation of platform molecule isosorbide.210−213 DMI has been assessed for its toxicity and mutagenicity and did\nnot display acute oral toxicity nor genotoxicity by Ames test.118 DMI was shown to be not readily biodegradable.118 DMI’s Kamlet–Taft properties\nshow that it possesses dipolarity/polarizability that is similar to\nDMF and DMAc; however, its hydrogen bond basicity is much less, and\nit is closer to acetone in that respect. Applications for DMI include\ngeneral synthesis as a replacement for traditional dipolar aprotic\nsolvents in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling,214 solid phase synthesis,215 and\nmembrane preparation.216 Uptake of DMI\nfor use in the personal care products industry has also been noted.217 A search of current literature using SciFinder218 shows that the uptake of DMI as a reaction\nsolvent is still quite low, with only 63 reported reactions in just\nfour publications.208,214,219,220 Dimethyl isosorbide:\na sorbitol derived dipolar aprotic solvent. Following a false start exploring whether N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone could offer advantages over the reprotoxic N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NEP was found to have reproductive\ntoxicity concerns),221N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone, see Figure 18, has been identified as a potential alternative to\nNMP due to its favorable characteristics: NBP is nonreproductively\ntoxic (according to OECD 414 test method), nonmutagenic (OECD 471),\nand also inherently biodegradable (OECD 302B).110 It is also possible to produce NBP from biorenewables.110 The apparent lack of reproductive toxicity\nmakes it an attractive alternative to NMP; however, NBP possesses\nacute oral toxicity that is greater than NMP so caution must still\nbe exercised when using this solvent. NBP resides in a similar solvent\nspace to other dipolar aprotic solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc,\nsee Table 2, and due\nto these similarities has been proposed as a somewhat safer “drop-in”\nalternative, though it should be noted the boiling point of NBP is\nsignificantly elevated at 241 °C, see Table 1, SN2 reaction kinetic experiments\nusing the Menschutkin reaction as a model reaction have shown that\nthe rate of reaction is highly dependent on the Kamlet–Taft\nparameter π* of the dipolar aprotic solvents screened; higher\nvalues lead to faster rates of reaction. NBP’s π* value\nof 0.77 is closest to acetonitrile’s of 0.75, and indeed the\nmost comparable rate of reaction experimentally observed for NBP was\nacetonitrile, seeFigure 19. NBP has also been examined for use as a drop-in replacement\nfor DMF in solid supported peptide synthesis.222 N-Butyl-2-pyrrolidone: a potential NMP\ndrop-in\nreplacement.

Methyl-5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate,\nsee Figure 20, otherwise\nknown commercially as Rhodiasolv PolarClean, is a clear, slightly\nyellow solvent. The nonvolatile liquid has a boiling point in the\nrange of 278–282 °C, a melting point of −60 °C,\nand a flash point of 144–146 °C. Similar to other dipolar\naprotic solvents, PolarClean is highly water miscible, with a solubility\nof greater than 490 g/L.223 It is reported\nthat the hygroscopicity of the solvent is very low, with water content\nvalues estimated between 0.00 and 0.10%, although some values up to\n0.30% have also been reported.223 Prior\nto increased use within synthetic chemistry, use as a crystal growth\ninhibitor in agrochemical formulations has been reported.224 A contributing factor to the sustainability\ncredentials of PolarClean arises from its production; it is produced\non an industrial scale from a byproduct of Nylon-66 manufacture, which\nwould otherwise be burnt for disposal.224 The production of PolarClean from this byproduct, methyleneglutarodinitrile\n(MDN), involves a multistep process. Starting from MDN, the route\nconsists of hydrogenation, hydration, cyclization, and subsequent\nring-opening with dimethylamine, followed by methylation of the remaining\ncarboxylic acid, see Scheme 3, yielding a mixture of two regioisomers.225 Further work has been described to redesign and improve\nthe synthetic route to PolarClean by Szekely and co-workers.104 Methyl-5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate:\nPolarClean. Similar in structure to PolarClean, a small number of diamide dipolar\naprotic solvents derived from succinic acid were reported by Byrne\nand co-workers in 2020.226 Designed to\nhave high dipolarity and low toxicity, the solvents were shown to\nperform effectively in the Heck cross-coupling reaction of iodobenzene\nand methyl acrylate in addition to potential uses in polymer solubilization\nand MOF synthesis.226 A novel\nclass of surfactant-based amphiphiles, including PS-750-M (also known\nas FI-750-M), polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS), d,l-α-tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycol\nsuccinate (TPGS-750-M), and SPGS-550-M (Nok), has recently emerged,\nwith the aim of facilitating efficient organic chemical reactions\nin water.227 When dissolved in water, the\nsurfactant amphiphilic molecules self-aggregate into micelles, with\nthe hydrophilic “head” interacting with the aqueous\nmedium, while the hydrophobic “tails” form an inner\n“lipophilic core”.227 The\nnanometer-sized particles formed during this aggregation process can\nbe thought of as nanoreactors, with localized pockets of high concentration\nreaction substrates, leading to rapid reaction rates.228 Use of these surfactants in an aqueous media\ncan allow significant reduction in the use of commonly used dipolar\naprotic solvents in reactions such as transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings,229 leading to a reduction of organic solvent waste\nstreams. When suitably optimized, these systems have been demonstrated,\noften on large scale,230 to lead to significant\nyield and selectivity improvements, reduced catalyst loadings,231 lower environmental footprints, and a general\nimprovement in productivity.232 Challenges\nassociated with the use of aqueous-surfactant systems include a lack\nof total generality (often a surfactant can be demonstrably compatible\nwith one class of reactions/starting materials and incompatible with\nanother), only an empirical/trial and error based understanding of\nreactions and why they work, mixing effects can be pronounced,233 preferential solubilization/dispersion of reagents\nversus products can affect reaction outcome,234 lack of in-house precedent/expertise to encourage the use of less\nmainstream reaction media, and extraction and isolation of products\nby conventional organic solvents. “Synthetic chemistry rules\nmost people learn are not universal. They apply to reactions in organic\nchemistry, but chemistry in water obeys different rules”;235 thus, discovering and learning these rules\nis an ongoing goal in the field. Many of the surfactants described\nin this section are commercially available at the time of writing,\nwhereas others are “designer”, that is, tailored specifically\nfor specific transformations. The aim of this section is to introduce\nthe reader to some of the cutting edge research in the field of organic\nsynthesis in aqueous-micellar systems. It also serves to demonstrate\nthat water does not have to be the enemy of the organic chemist but\na powerful ally.236 For further details,\nan excellent review discussing the challenges and opportunities faced\nby aqueous-micellar organic synthesis was published in 2021 in collaboration\nwith Novartis (Gallou et al.).237 PS-750-M, also known\nas FI-750-M, is a surfactant first described in 2017 in a publication\nby Handa et al. in collaboration with Novartis, for an aqueous media-based\npalladium-catalyzed coupling of nitroalkanes and aryl bromides.238 Derived from the naturally occurring amino\nacid l-proline, the surfactant can be prepared in a high-yielding\n4-step synthesis (overall 53% across 4 steps, Scheme 4). Since the initial publication, the surfactant\nhas been used to enable aqueous reactions including SNAr,239 α-arylations,240 fluorination of indoles,241 and Pd carbene-mediated\ninsertions.242 Polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS), see Scheme 5, is a first generation\nsurfactant to be shown to have utility in organic synthesis by Lipshutz\nand co-workers in 2008. Derived from the naturally occurring vitamin\nE307, α-tocopherol, PTS can be prepared by first condensing\nwith sebacoyl chloride, followed by dropwise addition of PEG-600,\nboth steps being carried out in the presence of triethylamine.243 Since first being described in organic synthesis\nas a surfactant, publications include Suzuki-Miyaura,244,245 Heck,246 Sonogashira,247 and Buchwald-Hartwig couplings,248 in addition to olefin metathesis.249,250 d,l-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycol\nsuccinate (TPGS-750-M), see Figure 21, is the second-generation variant of the amphiphile\nPTS, reported by Lipshutz and co-workers in 2011.55 Closely related to polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate\n(PTS), TPGS-750-M is again derived from the natural product α-tocopherol,\ndiffering in the carbon diacid and PEG chain link. Where PTS used\nthe 8 carbon acid linker sebacic acid, and PEG-600, TPGS has a shorter\n2-carbon diacid linker, in addition to the longer PEG-750-M chain.\nPreparation involves a similar sequence to that described for TPGS-750-M,\nwith sequential condensation of α-tocopherol with succinic anhydride\nin the presence of triethylamine, followed by PEG-750-M.55 In the publications disclosing the surfactant\namphiphile, its utility is shown in olefin metathesis, Suzuki-Miyaura,\nHeck, Sonogashira, Buchwald-Hartwig, Negishi, palladium catalyzed\nC–H activation, and palladium catalyzed allylations.55 A shortened, more stable version of this surfactant\nknown as TPG-Lite has also been developed in which the four carbon\nsuccinic acid linker is omitted. Reaction compatibility is broadly\nthat of TPGS-750M.251 d,l-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene\nglycol succinate also known as TPGS-750-M. In 2014, Lipshutz\net al. described a further enhancement to the previously designed\namphiphile surfactants, with a switch of the α-tocopherol to\nβ-sitosterol, see Figure 22. The resultant amphiphile, SPGS-550-M, otherwise known\nas “Nok”, was designed to be a more economically attractive\nsurfactant when compared with PTS and TPGS-750-M.229 Synthesis is similar to previous variants, with condensation\nof β-sitosterol with succinic anhydride, followed by further\nreaction with PEG-550-M.229 In the publication,\nthrough an extensive comparison process with TPGS-750-M, Nok was shown\nto perform as effectively as or more effectively than TPGS-750-M in\na range of reactions including metathesis, Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, Miyaura borylations, and Buchwald Hartwig aminations.229 Recent developments by the Lipshutz group have\nseen the invention of a low foaming surfactant known as “Coolade”.252 It is known that foaming can occur in surfactants\nthat possess long hydrophobic tails, the long tail leading to increased\nfoam volume and stability.252 Coolade does\nnot possess this tail, yet can still self-assemble into micelles.\nTypical reactions that suffered from foaming/frothing when conducted\nTPGS-750M, such as NaBH4 nitro reductions, were shown to\nbe free from foam when employing Coolade. Foam is generally seen as\nan inconvenience at best with larger reaction volumes and vessels\nrequired.252 Workup and product isolation\nmay also become complicated. Other reactions successfully demonstrated\nincluded double reduction of geminal dibromocyclopropanes, azide\nand sulfonyl azide reductions, and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. β-Sitosterol\nmethoxypolyethylene glycol succinate SPGS-550-M\n(Nok). In 2019, the DMSO inspired surfactant\n“MC-1” was\ndeveloped by Cortes-Clerget et al., and it is a designer surfactant\nthat specifically tailors to the needs of peptide chemistry, see Figure 23. The micelle accommodates\nboth amino acids/peptide starting materials and typical coupling reagents\nsuch as COMU in a polar yet still lipophilic environment.253 Multigram synthesis of dipeptides was successfully\nconducted in high yields (>90%) using this surfactant. MC-1, a designer\nsurfactant successfully used for peptide coupling\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions. Nonionic designer surfactant stearyl methoxyPEGglycol succinate\n(SMPS) was designed and successfully implemented in nitro-arene reduction\nand tethered indole synthesis by Kothandapani et al., see Figure 24(254) Apart from high yielding synthesis of the target substrates\nin this SMPS-water system, a preliminary toxicity screen was also\nconducted, which included phytotoxicity, bacterial toxicity, and aquatic\ntoxicity. It was shown at the concentrations screened that seed growth\nwas not affected compared to controls nor were there significant bacterial\ntoxicity effects or harmful effects toward zebrafish during the aquatic\ntoxicity screening.254 The surfactant design\nconcept used here was structured around the “Benign by Design”\nprinciple central to green chemistry.255 Designer surfactant SMPS used for Zn mediated nitro-arene reduction\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions.254 Utilizing surfactants in organic chemistry can\nbe challenging and\noften lack generality when it comes to surfactant choice, that is,\nthere is no one universal surfactant. Often, starting material solubility\nis problematic, and organic cosolvents have been utilized to change\nthe nature and dynamics of the emulsions formed. One particularly\nproblem was assessed by Sanzone et al. for the synthesis of rigid\nand poorly soluble organic semiconductor molecules.256 It was hypothesized that by increasing the aromatic content\nof the hydrophobic portion of the surfactant, additional π–π\ninteractions could be facilitated between the surfactant and reaction\nstarting materials. Thus, successful dispersion of starting materials\nthat exhibit self-aggregation due to π–π interactions\nwith themselves could be achieved. The surfactant designed, PiNAP-750M,\nsee Figure 25, allowed\nfor the generation of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling products at room\ntemperature, without cosolvent, and in short reaction times (of 10\nmin), see Scheme 6.\nReaction times were much slower when conducted in commercially available\nsurfactants such as K-EL (hours to days longer). E-factors were also\ndemonstrated to be up to an order of magnitude lower than the currently\npublished synthetic routes utilizing organic solvents when using the\nPiNAP-750M system.256 Designer surfactant\nPiNAP-750M exhibiting additional aromatic conjugation\nin the hydrophobic region.256 Designer surfactants can also be prepared from biorenewable materials,\nsuch as the synthesis of APGS-550-M from resin acids (from rosin)\nsuch as abietic acid, see Figure 26. The surfactant, prepared by Yang et al., was shown\nto be highly effective in facilitating Cu-mediated amidation of alkynyl\nbromides under aqueous-micellar conditions, see Scheme 7.257 Normally,\nthis type of transformation is conducted in dry solvents such as DMF,\nDMSO, or toluene at elevated temperatures. Side-reactions that can\noccur include homocoupling of alkynes to give 1,3-diynes, hydration\nof the diynes to furans, and hydration of ynamides to amides;257 thus, the presence of water in the system is\nsomewhat counterintuitive. However, the micellar conditions allow\nfor smooth conversion of bromoalkynes to the corresponding ynamides.\nA variety of alkyl and aryl groups were tolerated under the conditions\nand electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as amides, p-toluenesulfonamides, N-phenyl methanesulfonamides, oxazolidinones, and N-phenyl methanesulfonamides were all compatible with\nthis methodology showing broad functional group tolerance for this\ntype of transformation. Finally, the reaction medium was shown to\nbe recyclable as long as additional copper was added, and by the third\nrun using recycled medium, the reaction E-factor was as low as 5. APGS-550-M,\nprepared from potential biorenewable sources such as\nrosin and succinic acid. Chen et al. have also sought\nto exploit rosin as a potential source\nof raw materials for the synthesis of surfactants, see Figure 27.258 DAPGS-750-M is structurally related to APGS-550-M in that it is\nalso derived from abietic acid. Aqueous-micellar conditions using\nthis surfactant have allowed for β-scission of −CH3 from a range of aromatic tertiary alcohols to give corresponding\nketones. The same reaction conducted in traditional organic solvents,\nbinary aqueous–organic mixtures, and aqueous-micellar conditions\nsuch as TPGS-750-M, gave poor yields, see Scheme 8. One potential reason for this is due to\nthe different shape, size, and distribution of the DAPGS micelles\nwhen compared to other surfactants examined in this publication.258 A variety of acetophenone-like molecules were\nprepared from the corresponding tertiary alcohols in moderate to excellent\nyields, though anilines were not tolerated at all. Furthermore, bulky\nβ-carbon groups were preferentially eliminated in preference\nof methyl groups. In-flask recycling of the aqueous-micellar system\nwas also demonstrated with an E-factor of 11 observed after three\nruns. DAPGS-750M, a dehydroabietinol-derived surfactant."

      "text": "2-Methyltetrahydrofuran, see Figure 11, is an ethereal solvent that can be derived\nfrom renewable resources such as levulinic acid or furfural,153 which can themselves be derived from agricultural\nwaste such as corn stover, sugar cane bagasse, and rice straw.154 Life cycle assessment conducted on 2-MeTHF\nhas shown that production of the solvent from furfural derived from\ncorn-cob waste can reduce emissions by up to 97% when compared to\na traditional chemical synthesis of THF,155 though it is not always clear how individual supplies of 2-MeTHF\nare currently made. Structurally, 2-MeTHF differs from THF by the\naddition of one single methyl group, yet this addition is responsible\nfor several significantly different physiochemical properties. First,\nthe boiling point is elevated by 13 °C, see Table 1. 2-MeTHF is significantly less\nmiscible with water at room temperature (129.2 g/L)156 than THF (494.7 g/L).157 This\nimmiscibility has led 2-MeTHF to be employed as an extraction solvent\nand also as an organic component in aqueous–organic biphasic\nreaction mixtures.158 Interestingly, 2-MeTHF\nis also inversely soluble in water; at 0 °C, 2-MeTHF is 21 wt\n% soluble in water, whereas at 19 °C, this is reduced to 14 wt\n% and at 50 °C it is just 7.8 wt %.159 2-MeTHF is also more stable to acidic hydrolysis than THF and has\na longer t1/2 for R-Li mediated decomposition\nwhen compared to THF (130 min vs 10 min at 35 °C),158 though it is still susceptible to peroxide\nformation.160 As 2-MeTHF occupies a very\nsimilar solvent space to THF, see Table 2, it has been promoted as a “drop-in”\nreplacement for THF that is greener and more sustainable. A number\nof reagent solutions are now commercially available in 2-MeTHF such\nas Grignard and lithium reagents,161 further\npromoting their uptake as viable alternatives to THF and diethyl ether.153 Use of 2-MeTHF has seen gradual increase as\nnoted in the solvent use survey conducted by Ashcroft et al. (14%\nof publications in OPR&D for the period of 2009–2012 utilized\n2-MeTHF in some stage of the reported synthesis).9 Many reviews of solvents ignore price, as such information\ncan vary greatly depending on geography, purchasing contracts, or\ntime. However, it is instructive to note that a price comparison of\n2-MeTHF and THF was conducted in 2021 using Sigma-Aldrich’s\nwebsite, see Table 3. Search criteria used were anhydrous solvents containing 250 ppm\nbutylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) inhibitor and a purity of ≥99.9%.\nCost per liter of 2-MeTHF is nearly 2.5-times greater than standard\nTHF at the purity and grade that were considered. However, economies\nof scale come into effect at 200 L drum size; 2-MeTHF was only 13%\nmore expensive than THF. Depending on the details of the reaction\nconcerned, it is therefore easily conceivable that the increased cost\nof purchase could be offset by other reduced costs (e.g., less aqueous\nwaste for incineration). For further reviews of 2-MeTHF use, see Pace\net al. 2012,153 Monticelli et al. 2017,160 and most recently Bijoy et al. 2021.162 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran."

When suitably optimized, these systems have been demonstrated,\noften on large scale,230 to lead to significant\nyield and selectivity improvements, reduced catalyst loadings,231 lower environmental footprints, and a general\nimprovement in productivity.232 Challenges\nassociated with the use of aqueous-surfactant systems include a lack\nof total generality (often a surfactant can be demonstrably compatible\nwith one class of reactions/starting materials and incompatible with\nanother), only an empirical/trial and error based understanding of\nreactions and why they work, mixing effects can be pronounced,233 preferential solubilization/dispersion of reagents\nversus products can affect reaction outcome,234 lack of in-house precedent/expertise to encourage the use of less\nmainstream reaction media, and extraction and isolation of products\nby conventional organic solvents. “Synthetic chemistry rules\nmost people learn are not universal. They apply to reactions in organic\nchemistry, but chemistry in water obeys different rules”;235 thus, discovering and learning these rules\nis an ongoing goal in the field. Many of the surfactants described\nin this section are commercially available at the time of writing,\nwhereas others are “designer”, that is, tailored specifically\nfor specific transformations. The aim of this section is to introduce\nthe reader to some of the cutting edge research in the field of organic\nsynthesis in aqueous-micellar systems. It also serves to demonstrate\nthat water does not have to be the enemy of the organic chemist but\na powerful ally.236 For further details,\nan excellent review discussing the challenges and opportunities faced\nby aqueous-micellar organic synthesis was published in 2021 in collaboration\nwith Novartis (Gallou et al.).237 PS-750-M, also known\nas FI-750-M, is a surfactant first described in 2017 in a publication\nby Handa et al. in collaboration with Novartis, for an aqueous media-based\npalladium-catalyzed coupling of nitroalkanes and aryl bromides.238 Derived from the naturally occurring amino\nacid l-proline, the surfactant can be prepared in a high-yielding\n4-step synthesis (overall 53% across 4 steps, Scheme 4). Since the initial publication, the surfactant\nhas been used to enable aqueous reactions including SNAr,239 α-arylations,240 fluorination of indoles,241 and Pd carbene-mediated\ninsertions.242 Polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS), see Scheme 5, is a first generation\nsurfactant to be shown to have utility in organic synthesis by Lipshutz\nand co-workers in 2008. Derived from the naturally occurring vitamin\nE307, α-tocopherol, PTS can be prepared by first condensing\nwith sebacoyl chloride, followed by dropwise addition of PEG-600,\nboth steps being carried out in the presence of triethylamine.243 Since first being described in organic synthesis\nas a surfactant, publications include Suzuki-Miyaura,244,245 Heck,246 Sonogashira,247 and Buchwald-Hartwig couplings,248 in addition to olefin metathesis.249,250 d,l-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycol\nsuccinate (TPGS-750-M), see Figure 21, is the second-generation variant of the amphiphile\nPTS, reported by Lipshutz and co-workers in 2011.55 Closely related to polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate\n(PTS), TPGS-750-M is again derived from the natural product α-tocopherol,\ndiffering in the carbon diacid and PEG chain link. Where PTS used\nthe 8 carbon acid linker sebacic acid, and PEG-600, TPGS has a shorter\n2-carbon diacid linker, in addition to the longer PEG-750-M chain.\nPreparation involves a similar sequence to that described for TPGS-750-M,\nwith sequential condensation of α-tocopherol with succinic anhydride\nin the presence of triethylamine, followed by PEG-750-M.55 In the publications disclosing the surfactant\namphiphile, its utility is shown in olefin metathesis, Suzuki-Miyaura,\nHeck, Sonogashira, Buchwald-Hartwig, Negishi, palladium catalyzed\nC–H activation, and palladium catalyzed allylations.55 A shortened, more stable version of this surfactant\nknown as TPG-Lite has also been developed in which the four carbon\nsuccinic acid linker is omitted. Reaction compatibility is broadly\nthat of TPGS-750M.251 d,l-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene\nglycol succinate also known as TPGS-750-M. In 2014, Lipshutz\net al. described a further enhancement to the previously designed\namphiphile surfactants, with a switch of the α-tocopherol to\nβ-sitosterol, see Figure 22. The resultant amphiphile, SPGS-550-M, otherwise known\nas “Nok”, was designed to be a more economically attractive\nsurfactant when compared with PTS and TPGS-750-M.229 Synthesis is similar to previous variants, with condensation\nof β-sitosterol with succinic anhydride, followed by further\nreaction with PEG-550-M.229 In the publication,\nthrough an extensive comparison process with TPGS-750-M, Nok was shown\nto perform as effectively as or more effectively than TPGS-750-M in\na range of reactions including metathesis, Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, Miyaura borylations, and Buchwald Hartwig aminations.229 Recent developments by the Lipshutz group have\nseen the invention of a low foaming surfactant known as “Coolade”.252 It is known that foaming can occur in surfactants\nthat possess long hydrophobic tails, the long tail leading to increased\nfoam volume and stability.252 Coolade does\nnot possess this tail, yet can still self-assemble into micelles.\nTypical reactions that suffered from foaming/frothing when conducted\nTPGS-750M, such as NaBH4 nitro reductions, were shown to\nbe free from foam when employing Coolade. Foam is generally seen as\nan inconvenience at best with larger reaction volumes and vessels\nrequired.252 Workup and product isolation\nmay also become complicated.

In 2019, the DMSO inspired surfactant\n“MC-1” was\ndeveloped by Cortes-Clerget et al., and it is a designer surfactant\nthat specifically tailors to the needs of peptide chemistry, see Figure 23. The micelle accommodates\nboth amino acids/peptide starting materials and typical coupling reagents\nsuch as COMU in a polar yet still lipophilic environment.253 Multigram synthesis of dipeptides was successfully\nconducted in high yields (>90%) using this surfactant. MC-1, a designer\nsurfactant successfully used for peptide coupling\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions. Nonionic designer surfactant stearyl methoxyPEGglycol succinate\n(SMPS) was designed and successfully implemented in nitro-arene reduction\nand tethered indole synthesis by Kothandapani et al., see Figure 24(254) Apart from high yielding synthesis of the target substrates\nin this SMPS-water system, a preliminary toxicity screen was also\nconducted, which included phytotoxicity, bacterial toxicity, and aquatic\ntoxicity. It was shown at the concentrations screened that seed growth\nwas not affected compared to controls nor were there significant bacterial\ntoxicity effects or harmful effects toward zebrafish during the aquatic\ntoxicity screening.254 The surfactant design\nconcept used here was structured around the “Benign by Design”\nprinciple central to green chemistry.255 Designer surfactant SMPS used for Zn mediated nitro-arene reduction\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions.254 Utilizing surfactants in organic chemistry can\nbe challenging and\noften lack generality when it comes to surfactant choice, that is,\nthere is no one universal surfactant. Often, starting material solubility\nis problematic, and organic cosolvents have been utilized to change\nthe nature and dynamics of the emulsions formed. One particularly\nproblem was assessed by Sanzone et al. for the synthesis of rigid\nand poorly soluble organic semiconductor molecules.256 It was hypothesized that by increasing the aromatic content\nof the hydrophobic portion of the surfactant, additional π–π\ninteractions could be facilitated between the surfactant and reaction\nstarting materials.

It was shown at the concentrations screened that seed growth\nwas not affected compared to controls nor were there significant bacterial\ntoxicity effects or harmful effects toward zebrafish during the aquatic\ntoxicity screening.254 The surfactant design\nconcept used here was structured around the “Benign by Design”\nprinciple central to green chemistry.255 Designer surfactant SMPS used for Zn mediated nitro-arene reduction\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions.254 Utilizing surfactants in organic chemistry can\nbe challenging and\noften lack generality when it comes to surfactant choice, that is,\nthere is no one universal surfactant.

      "title": "Common Reactions in Dipolar Aprotic or Ethereal\nSolvents Replaced by More Sustainable Alternatives",
      "text": "In this\nsection, some commonly employed reactions using more sustainable,\ngreener dipolar aprotic or ether based solvents will be discussed.\nNote: solvents in reactions schemes and tables are color coded according\nto the same traffic light system used in Table 1. It is envisaged that these case studies\nand examples will provide reliable literature references from which\nchemists can rely for inspiration and encouragement when potentially\nconducting solvent screening/swapping investigations of their own. The amide moiety\nis abundant within drug molecules,259 and\namide coupling has been consistently highlighted as the most frequently\nemployed transformation in medicinal chemistry (Scheme 9, Scheme 10).260 Traditionally, amide\ncoupling has relied heavily on solvents with major regulatory issues\nsuch as dichloromethane and DMF, which are classed as solvents of\nconcern.44 On the basis of the importance\nof amide bond formation, it is pertinent that greener and more sustainable\nsolvent use should be explored whenever possible. Several examples of amide coupling reactions employing previously\ndiscussed sustainable alternatives to dipolar aprotics are discussed\nbelow. Recently, Camp and co-workers reported the synthesis of amides\nfrom acid chlorides and amines in the biobased solvent Cyrene.125 The substrate scope was investigated pertaining\nto both the acid chlorides and primary amines. Crucially, the addition\nof water allowed for precipitation of the product and facile isolation\nfrom the Cyrene solvent without the use of chromatography, see Scheme 9. Watson and co-workers\nhave also evaluated the use of Cyrene in the HATU-mediated synthesis\nof amides and peptides.119 It was found\nthat Cyrene was an effective replacement for DMF and NMP in the synthesis\nof lead-like molecules. Conditions were established that demonstrated\na broad functional group tolerance and broad generality after evaluating\n25 examples, with yields ranged from 63–100%, see Scheme 10. In 2017, Hunt\nand co-workers published an article comparing the utility of 2,2,5,5-tetramethyloxolane\n(TMO) in a series of reactions, one of being formation of an amide\nfrom phenylbutanoic acid and benzyl amine (Scheme 11), with traditional solvents\nsuch as toluene.103 In the studies, reaction\nkinetics analysis of the amide formation resulted in similar reaction\nrates to the effective toluene and p-cymene solvents,\nalthough the basicity (β) of TMO was similar to the less effective\nDMSO (Figure 28).\nAlso in this report is discussed the nature of ethers containing α-protons\nto the oxygen to form dangerous peroxides in solution, upon irradiation\nwith UV light. In a comparative irradiation experiment, traditional\nperoxide-forming ethers THF, 2-MeTHF, and diethyl ether formed varying\namounts of detectable peroxide over a period of six months, whereas\na solution of TMO stored under identical conditions formed no detectable\nperoxide. Reaction\nkinetic analysis for TMO (TMTHF)-mediated amide bond formation\nconducted by Byrne et al.103 Reproduced\nfrom ref (103) with\npermission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. Handa et al. have recently developed solvent-free methodology for\nfast and clean amide couplings in water that require no extraction,\nchromatography, or crystallization (Scheme 12).261 This is\nachieved by use of the l-proline-based amphiphile PS-750-M,\ndeveloped by the group.238 In the micelle\nof PS-750-M, the presence of 3° amides from the surfactant proline\nlinker structurally mimics DMF, NMP, and DMAc solvents. This allows\nextremely fast amide couplings, mediated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)\ncarbodiimide (EDC), rather than expensive and specialized coupling\nreagents. The conditions developed by the group result in the precipitation\nof the product and isolation by filtration. The methodology is also\nreproducible on different reaction scales. Mechanistic and kinetic\ninsights into PS-705-M mediated fast amide bond formation have also\nbeen provided.262 A similar approach to that of Handa et al. is that of the Lipshutz\ngroup, inventors of the α-tocopherol derived surfactant TPGS-750-M,55 who demonstrated in 2015 that amide bond formation\ncan be rapidly conducted in TPGS-750-M–water systems in high\nyields. Products are extracted from the surfactant–water system\nusing an organic solvent. The surfactant has been designed to be preferentially\nsoluble in aqueous layers leading to facile product recovery and ease\nof recyclability of the surfactant–water phase (5 cycles conducted)\nand low E-factors (organic solvent + water E factor = 7.8).263 Reaction times were typically 1–4 h,\nand yields of amino acid amide couplings to give dipeptides (19 compounds)\nranged from 84 to 99%. In 2013, Watson et al. published a solvent-reagent\nguide evaluating the use of greener alternatives to DMF and DCM for\namide bond formation. It was shown that reaction rates and yields\nfor alternative solvents such as dimethylcarbonate, EtOAc, and\n2-MeTHF were comparable to DCM and DMF and could be considered as\npractical alternatives for both academic and industrial use. CPME\nwas shown to be a poor alternative, most likely due to reaction mixtures\nbecoming heterogeneous as they progressed.264 Amidation in water using N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide\n(DIC) as coupling reagent has been effectively demonstrated by Fattahi\net al. with no requirement for surfactant additives.265 Both aromatic and aliphatic acids were shown to be compatible\nwith this methodology. Catalytic amide bond formation was reported\nby Coomber et al. in\n2019 using a combination of B(OCH2CF3)3 in tert-butyl acetate, see Scheme 13. Significantly, this methodology allows\nfor the coupling of unprotected amino acids in high yields. Scales\nof up to 100 mmol were demonstrated with product isolation achieved\nby resin catch and release protocols.266 Ultrafast amidation reactions using lithium\namides under aerobic\nconditions and ambient temperatures have recently been reported by\nFairley et al. under these conditions, amidation of ester starting\nmaterials. The reaction proceeds via C–O bond cleavage and\nis complete in just 20 s. Solvents employed were either 2-MeTHF or\nglycerol.267 High yields and good selectivity\nwere generally observed making this methodology an advancement in\naccessing carboxamides by sustainable means via air and moisture compatible\norganometallic chemistry. A further push toward substitution\nof regulated solvents used in\namidation reactions with more sustainable biobased solvents, such\nas p-cymene, was demonstrated by Clark and co-workers\nfrom the University of York in 2018 (Scheme 14).268 Discovery\nof a preferred alternative to toluene for this transformation (which\ncould also act as an alternative to dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMF) also removes concerns associated with reproductive toxicity.269 A direct comparison of yields for toluene and p-cymene in a silica-catalyzed amidation of carboxylic acids,\nacross a varied substrate scope of 13 amides, was performed. In the\nmajority of cases, p-cymene outperformed that of\ntoluene when carried out under reflux (bp 177 °C). This methodology\nhas further enhanced sustainability, with facile purification through\namide precipitation, recycling of solvents, and use of a reusable\nsolid-supported catalyst. Palladium\ncatalysis is used extensively in both industrial and academic synthetic\nchemistry laboratories as a powerful methodology for the formation\nof C–C bonds. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of organoboronic\nacids and their derivatives is the most frequently utilized palladium-catalyzed\nC–C bond forming reactions in the chemical industry, see Scheme 15.14 Traditionally, ethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and\nTHF or dipolar aprotics such as DMF are employed for a large proportion\nof these reactions.14 Owing to the frequent\nuse and importance of this reaction, there is great potential for\n“greener” solvent alternatives to have a significant\nimpact. Note that discussion surrounding the use of Suzuki-Miyaura\nreactions as a benchmark for the performance of new solvents suggests\nthat it is not the most informative reaction manifold.270 For example, cross-coupling can be successfully\nconducted in rapeseed oil and butter with both of these lipid-based\nsystems outperforming benchmark solvent DMF.271 Watson and co-workers developed a mild method\nfor the Suzuki-Miyaura\nreaction that employed Cyrene as a greener alternative to the commonly\nused dipolar aprotic solvents (Scheme 16).14 The reaction\nscope was extensively explored by varying both the organoboron nucleophile\nand aryl electrophile. The conditions developed demonstrated excellent\ngenerality and functional group tolerance. The group reported 57 examples\nwith yields ranging from 44 to 100%, from discovery to gram-scale\nreactions. Hunt et al. have explored the use of NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent\nfor Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 17.110 Yields for\na series of reactions performed in both NMP and NBP have been reported,\nto carry out a comparison, using a range of different substituted\naryl halides to explore the scope. Although the results showed that\nreactions using NMP as solvent gave better yields overall (76–90%\nfor model reactions utilizing 4-iodoacetophenone and a range\nof phenylboronic acids), reactions carried out in NBP still gave good\nyields (∼10% lower for the same model reaction), as seen in Table 5. However, the reactions\nhad not been optimized to specifically favor N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\nso there may also be potential to improve the performance of these\nreactions. Dimethyl isosorbide has been\ndemonstrated as an effective reaction\nmedium for several classical cross-coupling reactions. In 2018, Watson\net al. reported the use of DMI in several Suzuki-Miyaura reactions\n(12 substrates). In general, aromatics with various electron donating\nand withdrawing groups were tolerated as were variations in the electrophilic\ncomponent including vinyl groups, boronic acids, and pinacol esters.214 Reaction times were 1 h conducted at 60 °C\nwith 4 mol % Pd(dppf)Cl2, and yields ranged from 62 to\n>99%. Garg and co-workers have reported the nickel-catalyzed\nSuzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling between aryl halides and (hetero)aromatic boronic\nacids in a number of greener solvent alternatives.272 Initial solvent screening showed that EtOAc, iPrOH, 2-MeTHF,\nand t-amyl alcohol were all demonstrated to be excellent\nalternatives, see Scheme 18, to traditionally employed solvents such as toluene or 1,4-dioxane.\nThe reaction scope was further explored using 2-MeTHF and t-amyl alcohol as solvents. The scope was found to be broad\npertaining to both coupling partners, with heterocycles well tolerated\n(Scheme 18). The methodology\nwas demonstrated on multigram scales using low catalyst loadings (0.5–1.0\nmol % nickel) to provide desired products in reasonable to excellent\nyields. 2-MeTHF has also been successfully employed as reaction solvent\nin palladium–NHC-catalyzed amide and ester cleaving cross-coupling\nreactions.273 Following the emergence of eucalyptol as a sustainable,\nbioderived\nsolvent, the utility of it in cross-coupling reactions has been explored\nin a number of transformations by Berteina-Raboin and colleagues.205−207 When tested in palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling\nreactions of arylboronic acids with heteroaryl chlorides, eucalyptol\noutperformed reactions conducted in THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, with\nyields ranging from 44 to 99%. Reaction temperatures of 100 °C\nwere required for complete dissolution of reagents. The\nMizoroki-Heck cross-coupling, commonly referred to as the Heck cross-coupling,\ninvolves the reaction of an aryl halide with an alkene under Pd(0)/Pd(II)\ncatalysis. Common reaction solvents for the Heck reaction include\n1,4-dioxane, THF, and amide-based solvents such as DMF and DMAc, see Scheme 19. Although there\nare examples using more sustainable solvents such as water and acetonitrile,\nexpansion of the available green solvents for the transformation is\nunderway.110,214 Hunt et al. have explored the scope and limitations of the use\nof NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent for the Heck cross-coupling reaction,\nsee Scheme 20, in\naddition to Suzuki-Miyaura couplings.110 The group reported and compared the yields from a series of reactions\nperformed in both NMP and NBP. In summary, they found that the Heck\nreactions carried out in NBP gave comparable to or higher yields than\nthose carried out in NMP, see Table 6. This comparison has demonstrated that NBP was a viable\nreplacement to NMP as reaction solvent in the Heck cross-coupling\nreactions examined. Dimethyl isosorbide has also been\ndemonstrated as an effective\nreaction medium for the Mizoroki-Heck reaction by Watson et al.214 Optimized reaction conditions using 5 mol %\nPd(dppf)Cl2 were trialled on 12 substrates and showed that\nthe reaction proceeded well with aryl iodides and bromides facilitating\ncoupling of both electron poor and rich arenes with a variety of vinyl\nketones and acrylamides in 47–91% yield. Reactions were generally\nconducted at 80 °C for 1 h though some aryl bromide examples\nrequired heating at 115 °C for 24 h.214 Another alternative class of solvents shown to have utility\nin\nMizoroki-Heck cross-couplings reactions is that of cyclic carbonates,\nsee Figure 29. In\na study evaluating the use of a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents\nfor the transformation, Clark and colleagues demonstrated the effective\nuse of propylene and ethylene carbonate in the place of NMP and DMSO.107 In many cases, both cyclic carbonate solvents\nperformed as or more effectively than NMP across a wide substrate\nscope, tolerating substrates of various electronics.

Recently, Su et al.\nhave demonstrated that DMI could be effectively\nutilized in a Ni-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling of aryl bromides\nwith vinyl acetate (acting as a vinylating reagent).274 Moderate to excellent yields of the vinylated products\nwere observed across a wide and varied heteroaryl substrate scope,\nsee Scheme 21. The Sonogashira\ncross-coupling is a widely used palladium and copper-catalyzed process\nfor accessing functionalized alkyne species from terminal alkynes\nand aryl halides, see Scheme 22.275 Another powerful C–C\nbond forming reaction, the Sonogashira reaction is commonly performed\nin THF and DMF,276 both of which are problematic\ndue to peroxide formation and reprotoxicity, respectively. Because\nof the efficiency and widespread use of this reaction in both academia\nand industry, a search for greener solvent alternatives is highly\ndesirable. Cyrene has been successfully\nutilized by Watson et al. as reaction\nsolvent for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 23.127 Utilization of the safer, more sustainable Cyrene as an alternative\nto traditionally employed DMF127 was demonstrated\nacross a number of aryl and heteroaryl iodides and alkyne coupling\npartners. Broad tolerance to the optimized reaction conditions was\nobserved with yields of 65–99% generally reported, though yield\nvariability was observed for some electron deficient aryl bromides\n(28–99%). Further expansion of the methodology to Cacchi-type\nannulations furnished benzofuran and indole scaffolds in good to excellent\nyields (73–100%), see Scheme 24. Dimethyl isosorbide has been successfully utilized as\nreaction\nsolvent for the Sonogashira reaction by Watson et al. Twelve substrates\nwere synthesized using the same catalyst and base conditions as depicted\nin Scheme 23 (reactions\nwere conducted at 25 °C).214 A range\nof aryl iodides and bromides including electron rich and deficient\nexamples, and a number of functionalized alkynes including BMIDA and\nTIPS functionalities, were synthesized in 83–98% yields. One\nexample of a thiophenol derived alkyne was synthesized, though in\na lower yield of 65%.214 Cabri and\nco-workers have recently published an investigation into\nthe use of N-substituted-pyrrolidinone solvents,\nalong with a small number of others, as a reaction medium for the\nSonogashira coupling.276 Given the knowledge\nof the reprotoxicity problems associated with NMP,17 the safer and more sustainable species discussed, such\nas NBP (N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone) and NCP (N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidinone), were shown to outperform\nDMF and NMP following optimization of reaction conditions. In addition\nto the broad substrate scope (generally >90% isolated yields),\nthe\nmethodology was applied to the synthesis of Erlotinib, performing\na Sonogashira cross-coupling step in quantitative yield, without the\nneed for a CuI additive, see Figure 30.276 Yield comparison for\nmodel Sonogashira reaction conducted by Cabri\net al. using a variety of NMP/DMF drop-in replacements.276 In addition to the previously\nmentioned explorations of the utility\nof eucalyptol as a solvent in palladium-catalyzed processes, it was\nalso shown to be effective in Sonogashira cross-couplings.277 A slightly different system to regular Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, utilizing Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 and\nPCy3, without addition of CuI, furnished a range of cross-coupled\nproducts in moderate to good yields.277 It was noted that the cross-coupling of any heterocycles containing\nfree amine functionality, such as 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine is ineffective when using eucalyptol\nas the solvent; further investigations are required to optimize this\nprocess such that yields are comparable to those obtained using traditional\nSonogashira solvents such as DMF. Buchwald-Hartwig\namination is a widely employed cross-coupling strategy used for the\nformation of C–N bonds, see Scheme 25. Commonly used for substrates that are\nless reactive to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the palladium-catalyzed\ntransformation is also known to perform well with oxygen and sulfur\nnucleophiles.278,279 1,4-Dioxane is commonly utilized\nas reaction solvent for these transformations, and 1,4-dioxane has\nserious issues and is regarded as a solvent of concern.280 A number of strategies\nto overcome this issue include reactions\nconducted solvent-free,281 in water,282 or using water–surfactant systems.55 In 2014, the Lipshutz group published methodology\ndescribing Buchwald-Hartwig amination using the TPGS-750-M surfactant–water\nsystem, see Scheme 26. In 2020, Manikandan and co-workers\nopted for the use of 2-MeTHF\nin the synthesis of a triazolo-pyridazine-6-yl-substituted via a Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-coupling.283 The 2-MeTHF was used\nas the solvent in the final stage of the synthesis for 12 medicinally\nrelevant antidiabetic compounds, and yields were reported in the range\nof 92–98% using a catalytic combination of 10 mol % Pd2(dba)3/XPhos, in the presence of NaOtBu at room temperature for 4 h, see Scheme 27. The use of a surfactant however is not always necessary, and aqueous\nsingle or two-phase systems have been known in the Pd-catalyzed amination\nmanifold.284 Further exploration into aqueous\nsystems has also been conducted and was well documented by Buchwald\net al. in 2003.285 Water has also\nbeen successfully utilized as reaction solvent in\nrelated Cu-catalyzed Ullman-type reactions,286 as have other safer solvents such as tBuOH.287 Solvent-free examples are also known.288 Bio-based solvent eucalyptol has also been studied\nfor its potential\nuse as solvent in the Buchwald-Hartwig amination, see Scheme 28. A number of model reactions\nwere examined encompassing a variety of bromoarenes and amines and\nanilines. Moderate to excellent yields were obtained (43–99%),\nin many cases better than the reported yields for the analogous reaction\nconducted in a conventional dipolar aprotic solvent.289 Ma et al. have demonstrated\nthat tBuOH could be\neffectively used as an alternative to 1,4-dioxane in the cross-coupling\nof amino acid esters with aryl bromides and chlorides, see Scheme 29.290 The methodology was not just limited to α-amino acids\nbut also included β-, γ-, and δ-, proteinogenic,\nand nonproteinogenic amino acids. Products were prepared generally\nin moderate to high yields with retention of optical activity. Other\nexamples utilizing tBuOH in Pd catalyzed C–N\nhave also been reported,291 and alcohols,\nsuch as iPrOH, have also seen use in Pd-catalyzed\nC–N and C–O bond forming reactions.292 Solvent-free, ball milling conditions have been described\nby Shao et al. in 2018.293 A solvent selection guide for conducting acyl Buchwald-Hartwig\ntransamidation reactions has recently been compiled by Lei et al.\nIn their study, an exhaustive solvent screen of alternative solvents\nhas been conducted including 2-MeTHF, CPME, GVL, anisole, and p-cymene, see Scheme 30.294 1,2-Dimethoxyethane\nwas used as a benchmark solvent, giving 86% yield in the same transformation.\nBoth 2-MeTHF and MTBE showed excellent generality and applicability\nacross a wide range of transamidation coupling partners demonstrated\nthrough a substrate screen consisting of a variety of anilines and\namides bearing EDGs and EWGs. Thus, dipolar aprotics of concern in\nthese reactions such as THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane can be effectively\nreplaced by a drop-in alternative.294 Because of\nthe widespread use of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, and variants thereof,\nin synthetic and medicinal chemistry,14 and the requirement for a boronic acid or boronate coupling partner,\nsustainable methods for accessing these moieties are highly desirable.\nTraditional methods for preparation of boronic acids and boronates,\nsuch as the Miyaura borylation (Scheme 31), require dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMSO, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane.295 Recently, advancements have been made toward more sustainable\nsolvents\nfor borylation reactions, with cyclic ethers and cyclic ketones being\nused as substitutes. A recent publication by Frantz and co-workers\ndescribes a sustainable method for accessing arylboronic acids from\npseudohalides and B2(OH)4 using a 0.01 mol %\npalladium catalyst loading in a 1:1 mixture of 2-MeTHF and MeOH, see Scheme 32.296 Also described is a direct one-pot conversion of aryl halide\nto the boronic acid diethanolamine (DEA) adduct, providing synthesis\nof boronate species less susceptible to protodeboronation.297 This transformation is well-tolerated for aryl\nand (hetero)aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides, with yields ranging\nfrom 60–85%, on the choice of catalyst, (AtaPhos)2PdCl2 or XPhos-Pd-G3. The effectiveness of the methodology\nis demonstrated by a one-pot tandem borylation-Suzuki sequence, furnishing\na diverse range of C–C coupled products with no more than 2\nmol % palladium used for the overall two-step process. Many more examples\nof greener palladium-catalyzed borylations of aryl halides using B2(OH)4 or B2pin2 are known\nin 2-MeTHF298 and CPME.299 Although not as widely used as aryl and hetero(aryl)boronic\nacids and boronates, alkenyl boronates have important applications\nin Diels–Alder cycloadditions, as precursors to cyclopropyl\nboronates, and as effective radical acceptors.300 Recently, a number of publications have highlighted the\nuse of sustainable solvents in borylation reactions of alkynes, both\nrhodium301 and copper-catalyzed.302 A publication by Hutzler and co-workers in\n2017, outlining routes to the synthesis of herbicides, included a\nrhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with HBpin, with a solvent\nchoice of cyclohexanone.301 The reaction,\ncarried out below room temperature (18 °C), yielded the desired Z-alkene in 52% yield after 2 h (Scheme 33). Similarly, a publication by Woźniak and co-workers in 2019,\nshowcasing the utility of copper-NHC complexes containing sulfone\nand sulfoxide side-chains, describes a low catalyst loading (0.05\nmol %) hydroboration of alkynes, using CPME as the solvent, with a\nMeOH additive (10:1), see Scheme 34.302 In this instance, CPME\noutperforms both isopropanol and toluene, and the catalytic system\napplies to both alkynes (yielding alkenyl boronates) and alkenes (yielding\nalkyl boronates). Yields for all substrates studied are in excess\nof 95%, proving the methodology a very powerful and sustainable way\nto hydroborate alkynes and alkenes. In addition to solvent swaps to\nCPME, 2-MeTHF, and cyclohexanone, MTBE has also been shown to be highly\neffective in borylation sequences. Reported in 2009, Marder and co-workers\nutilized the solvent in a one-pot C–H borylation/Suzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling sequence, a transformation shown to be highly effective\nfor both aryl and heteroaryl substrates.174 Borylation in protic solvents such as MeOH303 and EtOH304 has also been reported including\nin the 2020 report on transition metal-free borylation of aryl halides\nusing bis-boronic acid in MeOH.305 The direct\nactivation and functionalization of C–H bonds, which avoids\nthe installation of intermediate functional groups, is both step-\nand atom-efficient, see Scheme 35. However, the sustainability of C–H activation\nis hindered (especially for large-scale chemistry) by numerous factors,\none of these being the introduction of safer, greener, and more sustainable\nsolvents. In many examples of chemistry involving C–H activation,\ngreen solvents have been too easily overlooked in preference to solvents\nsuch as THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, which have been frequently used.306 The inclusion of safer solvents such as 2-MeTHF\n(and exploring less conventional PEG or aqueous-micellar systems)\nduring reaction optimization and solvent screening is therefore critical\nif the field of C–H activation is to migrate away from solvents\nof concern. Reviews on the subject of emerging unconventional organic\nsolvents for C–H bond activation have been published in 2019\nby Gandeepan et al.,307 in 2020 by Yu et\nal.,308 and in 2021 by Dhawa et al.309 and Dalton et al.306 We direct the reader toward these bodies of work for further information\nand specific examples. The 2-MeTHF was used as a replacement to THF and 1,4-dioxane by\nAckerman and co-workers in a mild C–H activation of allenes\nusing a Fe(0) phosphine catalyst (Scheme 36).310 Across\na selection of aryl substrates containing an α-ketone directing\ngroup, efficient C–H functionalization using Fe(PMe3)4 yielded a diverse range of products in good to excellent\nyields. Also demonstrated was a tolerability of hydroxyl, amino, and\nalkoxycarbonyl moieties, in addition to mechanistic and computational\ninvestigations. The bioderived solvent eucalyptol has also been shown to have utility\nas a solvent for direct C–H arylations by Berteina-Raboin and\ncolleagues.277 Following synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines from the corresponding 2-aminopyridine\nand 2-bromoacetophenone derivatives, Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed\ndirect C–H arylation at the C-3 position using bromobenzene\nin eucalyptol yielded the desired arylated product in 60% (5 mol %\ncat.) and 61% yields (10 mol % cat.) after 24 h at 150 °C, see Scheme 37. Other bio-based\nsolvents such as cumene have also been promoted as a potential solvent\nfor C–H bond activation chemistry.308 A regioselective C–H functionalization of 1,2,3-triazoles\nin GVL was accomplished by Vaccaro and co-workers in continuous flow,\nsee Scheme 38. Across\n8 substrates, excellent yields (79–91%) of the cyclized product\nwere obtained, with solvent recovery and reuse, without further purification,\nalso demonstrated.311 Kakiuchi and co-workers developed a Ru-catalyzed stereoselective\nC–H arylation of ortho-methoxylated acetophenones and C–H\nmonoarylation of ortho-unsubstituted acetophenones in high yields\nusing cyclohexanone as solvent, see Scheme 39. Note: styrene was utilized as a necessary\nadditive to selectively provide monoarylation.312,313 Aqueous surfactant systems such as TPGS750M-H2O have\nalso been successfully utilized in ruthenium-catalyzed C–H\narylation reactions.314 PEG-based systems have been demonstrated as promising alternatives\nto conventional solvents as evidenced by Ackermann et al., who first\nshowed in 2009 that PEG-20000 could be used as solvent for either\nRu- or Pd-catalyzed direct arylation chemistry.315 This discovery has led to other PEG-derived systems such\nas that demonstrated by Reddy et al.316 who showed that PEG-400 was an excellent solvent for Cu-mediated\ncross-coupling of oxadiazoles with dibromoalkenes, see Scheme 40. When conventional\nsolvents such as CH3CN and DCM were screened instead of\nthe PEG, no reaction took place. The t-butyl carbamate (Boc)\ngroup is a common protecting group for amines,\nmost often utilized in multistep syntheses due to its stability under\na wide range of reaction conditions. One of the most common methods\nof deprotection typically employs 4 M HCl in 1,4-dioxane, a solvent\nit would be good to replace when possible, see Scheme 41. Commercially available alternatives to 1,4-dioxane\npreparations\nof HCl are available in safer, more sustainable solvents including\nethereal alternative CPME.317 Given the\nincreasing availability of HCl solutions in more sustainable solvents,\nit is recommended that alternative mixtures are considered before\nopting to use HCl in 1,4-dioxane. Several examples throughout the\nliterature demonstrate the utility of more sustainable methods for\nBoc deprotections, as part of lengthy syntheses. As part of\nthe design and testing of a sustainable methodology\nfor an improved Pinner reaction in CPME, Torisawa and co-workers discuss\nthe use of a 4 M solution of HCl in CPME for the deprotection of a\nBoc-protected amino acid derivative.318 Stirring of the derivative for 6 h at 0 °C provided the desired\ndeprotected amine in 97% yield, with the workup procedure also employing\nthe greener solvent. A common alternative acidic medium for the deprotection\nof Boc groups involves the use of CF3CO2H, trifluoroacetic\nacid (TFA). The use of TFA within a sustainable solvent was demonstrated\nas part of a peptide coupling by North et al. in 2017, in which the\nfinal Boc deprotection step used a solution of TFA in propylene carbonate,\nsee Scheme 42.319 Use of this combination provided sequential\ndeprotection yields between 80 and 99% yields in the three individual\nBoc deprotection steps in the multistep synthesis of tetrapeptides. An additional example demonstrating the deprotection of a Boc group\nwas reported in a Pfizer patent in 2005.320 Instead of using TFA or HCl, a biphasic mixture of sodium tert-butoxide in H2O/2-MeTHF provided improved\nconditions for the deprotection of a range of heterocyclic substrates\nwith medicinal applications, see Scheme 43.158 Aldehydes, amides, esters, and carboxylic\nacids are abundant groups\nin synthetic organic chemistry, whether as part of a reaction intermediate\nor pharmaceutically relevant scaffold. Traditional methods for the\npreparation of such species include hydroformylations of alkenes and\namide couplings, to name a few, which often require toxic heavy metals,321 pyrophoric organometallic reagents,322 or allergenic amide coupling reagents.323 In recent years there has been a shift toward\ncatalytic methodologies including palladium-catalyzed formylations\nand carbonylations of aryl halides using carbon monoxide gas or surrogates\nthereof.324 Unfortunately, use of the gas\nis often accompanied by the use of dipolar aprotic solvents such as\nDMF,325 see Schemes 44 and 45, or 1,4-dioxane,326 see Scheme 46, to aid the solubility of the gas in the reaction\nmedium.327 Recently, there has been interest in substituting reprotoxic dipolar\naprotic solvents with more sustainable alternatives for carbonylation\nreactions. One of the alternative solvents for such transformations\nhas been the cellulose-derived solvent GVL. In 2016, initial exploratory\nwork into the use of biomass-derived solvents by Mika and colleagues\nrevealed the utility of GVL in the aminocarbonylation of aryl\nhalides under CO(g), see Scheme 47.328 In a system catalyzed\nby Pd(OAc)2/PPh3, it was shown that a mixture\nof the carboxamide and ketocarboxamide products could be obtained,\nand relative ratio of the ketocarboxamide could be favored by\nincreasing of CO(g) pressure, see Table 7.328 Following\non from this initial work, the group later published\na palladium-catalyzed carbonylative esterification of aryl iodides\nwith a wide range of alcohols in 2020.329 Again using GVL, the transformation provided a wide range of ester\nproducts with significantly improved yields compared to the previous\naminocarbonylation,328 ranging from\n39 to 99% with phenol coupling partners and 13–99% with alkyl\nalcohol coupling partners, see Scheme 48.329 In 2019, Schwab and co-workers\nreported a simple and efficient\naminocarbonylation process to access 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides\nfrom the related heteroaryl iodide species.330 The Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed process involved in situ generation of CO(g) using a combination of H2SO4 and HCO2H within CO-ware equipment.\nUtilizing the sustainable solvent dimethyl carbonate, a variety of\nfunctionalized 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides were produced, with yields\nranging from 33 to 98% (Scheme 49).330 In the area of carboxylation reactions, in 2015, Levacher\nand co-workers\nreported a sustainable carboxylation of organic (heteroaryl, alkenyl,\nand allyl) halides in 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 50.331 Using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl formate as a CO2(g)\nsurrogate, and in the process eliminating the requirement for a high\nCO2-solubilizing dipolar aprotic solvent and opting for\nthe use of 2-MeTHF, a wide range of N-hydroxysuccinimide\nesters were accessible (Scheme 50). The methodology was shown to be effective in the\ncarboxylation of a functionalized quinoline intermediate in the preparation\nof a number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, with\nthe transformation progressing in 82% isolated yield.331 Metal-catalyzed hydroamination of styrenes has recently been reported\nby Mulks et al., see Scheme 51. In their work, the conventional wisdom of air- and moisture-free\norganometallic reactions is challenged by their demonstration of hydroamination\nof aryl alkenes in 2-MeTHF using lithium amides, see Table 8. Reactions were open to air\nand moisture and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Yields were\nmoderate to excellent with some incompatibility observed when using\nstyrenes containing aryl halide moieties.332 Remarkably, the presence of adventitious moisture was shown to be\nbeneficial and not detrimental. Reactions were accelerated by moisture,\nwhich generated free amine in situ at a steady rate.332 Sodium amides were also shown to be compatible\nwith the methodology. In 2020, a publication by Gevorgyan et al.\ninvestigated the utility\nof newly discovered biomass-sourced solvents in carboxylation reactions.208 In an overall transformation for the hydrocarboxylation\nof alkenes, via a boronate species from an initial hydroboration with\n9-BBN, sustainable solvents including eucalyptol, dimethyl isosorbide\n(DMI), and GVL were screened, see Scheme 52. Given that the process occurs via a boronate\nspecies, the effectiveness of the secondary carboxylation of boronic\nacid pinacol esters, Bpins, was also explored. For the overall hydrocarboxylation\nof 4-methylstyrene, 2-MeTHF, eucalyptol, DMI, and GVL were all found\nto outperform dipolar aprotics of concern including THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nsee Table 9. The hydroboration\nmethodology was not restricted to just benzylic alkenes, that is,\nstyrenes.208 For the conversion of phenyl Bpin to the corresponding phenyl carboxylic\nacid, of the general type depicted in Scheme 53, DMI was found to outperform THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nwith 2-MeTHF and (+)-rose oxide also notably performing above 70%\nyield (Table 10).\nIn addition to these two reactions, the solvents were comparatively\nscreened for numerous other carboxylation processes including transition\nmetal-catalyzed carboxylations (copper, zirconium, iron, and nickel).208 The Cu-catalyzed carboyxylation methodology\nwas further applied toward the synthesis of active pharmaceutical\ningredients Fenoprofen (60% yield) and Flurbiprofen (53% yield). Pd-catalyzed alkoxy- and amino-carbonylation and aryl bromide/boronic\nacid carbonylation in greener more sustainable solvents has been recently\ndemonstrated by Ismael et al.333 Sixteen\npotentially safer, more sustainable solvents were included during\nsolvent screening investigations including dipolar aprotic alternatives\nsuch as DMI, GVL, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, and\nether 2-MeTHF. It was found that aminocarbonylation proceeded\nwell in DMC while alkoxycarbonylation was successfully conducted\nin DMC and 2-MeTHF.333 Lastly, a\nvery recent report by Elorriaga and colleagues disclosed\na hybrid synthetic method in which an aluminum-catalyzed fixation\nof carbon dioxide in 2-MeTHF led to conversion of epoxides into tertiary\nalcohols.334 This process, catalyzed by\nAlEt2(κ2-bpzbdeape) (bpzbdeape = 1,1-bis(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethan-1-ol),\nresults in insertion of CO2 into one of the epoxide C–O\nbonds and subsequent ring expansion to form 5-membered cyclic carbonates\nin a near-quantitative yield. These cyclic carbonates, derived from\nthe structure of the starting epoxide, are then treated with 5 equiv\nof an alkyllithium reagent (e.g., EtLi), resulting in rapid conversion\nto the trialkyl alcohol. This methodology highlights an efficient\nmethod for the fixation of carbon dioxide to produce a range of highly\nsubstituted tertiary alcohols in one pot (Scheme 54).334 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution, or SNAr, is one of the most commonly used classes of reaction for\nsynthesis of aryl and heteroaryl ring systems, see Scheme 55.260 Because of the ease of reaction, including room temperature procedures,\nhigh-yielding transformations, and the ability to predict regioselectivity,335 the popularity of this reaction class has significantly\nincreased in the previous 30 years.260 Although\nthere are many examples using sustainable solvents in SNAr reactions, incidences using solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and THF\nare also prevalent within the literature.336,337 In the previous 5 years, a number of advances\nhave been made toward\nthe use of novel, sustainable solvents in nucleophilic aromatic substitution\nreactions (SNAr). In 2019, Szekely and co-workers discussed\nthe use of novel solvent PolarClean alongside other greener alternatives\n(GVL, Cyrene, and propylene carbonate) in a selection of reaction\nclasses including SNAr reactions.104 Using model reactions for the substitution of phenol or benzimidazole\non substrate bis(4-fluorophenyl) sulfone, comparisons between the\nsustainable solvents and more traditional alternatives of concern\n(DMAc, toluene) were explored, see Scheme 56. Using phenol, the more favorable alternatives\nperformed effectively compared to DMAc/toluene (86–92% compared\nto 70%) though were slightly less effective using benzimidazole (77–87%\ncompared to 97%), see Table 11. Studying the use of Cyrene-derived solvents such as\nthose falling\ninto the Cygnet class, Clark and colleagues at the University of York\nexplored the substitution of these solvents in nucleophilic aromatic\nfluorination reactions of pyridines.66 In\nthe study, which also involved use in other reaction classes, kinetic\ninvestigations in the fluorination of 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine using\na Cygnet 0.0 and a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents were carried\nout. Cygnet 0.0 resulted in higher reaction rates that MeCN and NMP,\nwith comparable rates to DMF.66 A small\nselection of publications in the previous 5 years have opted for a\nstraight solvent swap of the disfavored THF for the more sustainable\nalternative 2-MeTHF, mostly focusing on SNAr reactions\nfor medicinal chemistry applications. While investigating Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-couplings, Buchwald and Smith discovered that in a small number\nof cases when coupling secondary amines with the model substrate,\nthe reaction in 2-MeTHF proceeded effectively under noncatalyzed conditions.338 In the design of a greener synthetic route\nto an EGFR receptor inhibitor, McWilliams and co-workers from Pfizer\nsubstituted THF for 2-MeTHF in a key SNAr step, yielding\nthe desired product in 90% yield, see Scheme 57.339 A report by Parmentier et al.\nin 2016 demonstrated the utility\nof surfactant-based amphiphiles in the synthesis of a pharmaceutically\nrelevant API.340 Looking to enhance the\nfirst generation route for synthesis, the group explored the use of\nTPGS-750-M in water over the 5-step synthesis, with the primary step\ninvolving an SNAr reaction of an amine fragment and an\n(hetero)aryl electrophile (structures likely withdrawn from the publication\ndue to intellectual property restraints). For this SNAr\nstep, a switch from organic solvents to a surfactant–water\nsystem resulted in a slightly diminished yield of 75% compared to\n87%, but for the overall 5-step route, the process mass intensity\n(PMI) of the process was decreased by 32%.340 More recently, Berteina-Raboin and co-workers explored the\nuse\nof the widely available PEG-400 (polyethylene glycol) as a solvent\nin nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, see Scheme 58.341 The reaction was shown to perform effectively, using a range of\naliphatic and aromatic amines, on medicinally relevant substrate classes\nincluding imidazo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazines. For the wide ranging substrate scope, yields are\nreported in the range of 70–99%.341 Various PEG variants have also been successfully applied in many\nmetal-mediated reactions including oxidation, reduction, cross-coupling,\nand polymerization. This subject has been well reviewed by Colacino\net al.342 Often, organic solvents\ncan be replaced entirely from SNAr type chemistry. In 2013,\nWalsh et al. demonstrated that several\nSNAr reactions comprising heteroaryl chlorides such as\npyrimidine, pyrazine, and quinazoline could be conducted in water\nin the presence of KF. Surprisingly, several transformations that\nwere previously reported in the literature as requiring transition\nmetal catalysis were able to be conducted free from Pd.343 Organometallic-based\nreactions, such as those involving the use of alkyl lithium reagents,\nGrignard reagents, and metal hydride reductions, are commonly carried\nout in ethereal solvents and hydrocarbons due to the need for stability\nunder basic conditions.204,344 The most commonly\nused solvents within this class include diethyl ether, THF, and 1,4-dioxane,\nall of which are solvents of concern, see Figure 31.8 In recent\nyears, as a solution to the ongoing issues surrounding these solvents,\n2-MeTHF158,160 and CPME345 have\nboth been proposed as sustainable alternative solvents in a range\nof organometallic reactions, key examples of which will be discussed\nin this section. A number of commonly employed organometallic reagents\nare also now available as commercial preparations in alternative solvents\nsuch as 2-MeTHF.346 Organometallic reagents\nand their commonly employed ethereal solvents. 2-MeTHF\nhas been successfully utilized in a multitude of organometallic\nreactions, often acting as a “drop in” replacement for\nTHF or 1,4-dioxane. In 2010, Carbone et al. demonstrated that 2-MeTHF\ncould be used as solvent in asymmetric deprotonation reactions where\na chiral amine anion base is prepared in situ. Remarkably,\nthe chiral nature of the amine base is critical for enantioselectivity\nin asymmetric lithiation reactions when THF or 2-MeTHF are used as\nsolvent; anion bases derived from (−)-sparteine proceeded with\nlow enantioselectivity, whereas when a (+)-sparteine surrogate was\nemployed, excellent selectivity was observed.347 When MTBE was employed as solvent, excellent enantioselectivity\nwas observed for both sparteine bases, see Table 12 and Scheme 59. The selectivity is explained by the authors\nthrough a series of experiments investigating the solution phase dimerization\nand organization of the lithium base solvent complexes. The (+)-sparteine\nsurrogate used is (+)-(1R,2S,9S)-11-methyl-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7tridecane]. Mild, chemoselective N-TBS\nprotection of anilines\nhas been reported by Pace et al. using 2-MeTHF as a direct replacement\nfor THF. Under their optimized reaction conditions, TBS protection\nof aniline was conducted at 0 °C in just 30 min using MeLi and\nTBDMSCl in excellent yields (88–98%, 15 examples). Excellent\nchemoselectivity was also observed when iodo and bromo anilines were\nutilized as substrates; no lithium-halogen exchange was observed when\nusing 2-MeTHF as solvent but exchange did occur when using diethyl\nether. Finally, site selective TBS protection of aniline nitrogen\nover alkylamino nitrogen atoms was demonstrated, see Scheme 60. When using THF or diethyl\nether, a 1:1 mixture was observed. This remarkable selectivity has\nbeen proposed by the authors as being due to a reduction in the amount\nof highly polar amine dianion formed in 2-MeTHF due to the solvent’s\npolarity.348 Additionally, the authors\nundertook an examination of deprotection conditions showing that it\nwas possible to deprotect the TBS protected anilines in near quantitative\nyield in 2 h by simply stirring the compounds in a suspension of silica\ngel in an ethanol:water mixture (1:5). Note: −50 °C\nused here instead of 0 °C. The utility\nof 2-MeTHF in LiBr mediated selective 1,2-additions\nof organolithium reagents to α,β-unsaturated imines, ketones,\nand aldehydes to give a variety of allylic alcohols and amines has\nbeen demonstrated.349 Notably, no 1,4-addition\nproducts were detected by 1H NMR, and the reactions were\nconducted at 0 °C making this an attractively simple method.\nAnalogous reactions conducted in THF took longer and gave poorer yields\nwhen compared to 2-MeTHF (e.g., 6 h 79% yield vs 2 h quantitative\nyield for the 1,2 addition of MeLi to cyclohexenone), see Scheme 61. Other lithium base mediated reactions that have been successfully\nconducted in 2-MeTHF include preparations of γ-hydroxy-α,β-acetylenic\nesters using the base lithium tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP).350 Once more, Pace et al. have demonstrated the\nsuperior utility of 2-MeTHF through their exhaustive screening of\nhydrocarbon and ethereal solvents in the reaction of methyl-2-bromoacrylate\nwith benzaldehyde in the presence of a strong alkyllithium base, see Scheme 62. The 2-MeTHF gave\na 94% yield of the desired alcohol in just 1.5 h at −40 °C\ncompared to THF, which gave just 67% under the same conditions. Efficient access decorated four- and six-membered sulfur containing\nheterocycles (i.e., thietanes and thiopyrans) have also been achieved\nthrough a lithiation electrophile trapping strategy using 2-MeTHF\nas solvent, see Scheme 63. The 2-MeTHF was shown to improve regioselectivity considerably\nover THF.351 A wide range of benzylic and\naliphatic electrophiles were utilized, and varying degrees of electrophile\ndependent stereocontrol were observed. Other areas of organometallic chemistry in which 2-MeTHF has seen\nutility include zirconium chemistry such as that employing Schwartz’s\nreagent ((C5H5)2ZrHCl). Schwartz’s\nreagent in the presence of 2-MeTHF has been used to reduce isocyanates\nto formamides under mild conditions with excellent chemoselectivity\nand stereoretention of chiral substrates observed (room temperature,\n1 h), see Scheme 65.352 THF gave\nslightly poorer yields of about −5% during solvent screening\nreaction development. Similarly, Schwartz’s reagent can be\nutilized to reduce isothiocyanates to thioformamides.351 Electron withdrawing groups attached to the\naromatic isocyanates were also well tolerated including reactive functional\ngroups such as azo and azide motifs.353 The use of 2-MeTHF and the use of an in situ generated\nSchwartz reagent as the hydride source were crucial for obtaining\nhigh chemocontrol.354 Schwartz’s reagent\nis prepared in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and LiAl(O-t-Bu)3H, that is, Snieckus protocol. Subtle differences in the solubilizing and stabilizing\neffect of\n2-MeTHF have been effectively leveraged by Lelo et al., who have successfully\nemployed this solvent to promote α-elimination of lithium halide\nsalts to carbenoids, that is, Kirmse’s α-elimination.\nTaking advantage of the unique properties of 2-MeTHF, LiX salts have\nbeen degraded to carbenoids and reacted in situ with\nepoxides to give β-halohydrins. Employing THF or diethyl ether\nunder the same conditions helps to stabilize the lithium salts, and\nthe transformations were poorly accommodated by these more stabilizing\nsolvents.355 Other uses of ICH2X include the NaBH4-mediated reduction of diselenides\nin the presence of ICH2F to give α-fluoromethyl selenoethers.356 Synthesis of secondary amides from phenyl\nthiocarbamates and commercially\navailable Grignard reagents has been demonstrated by Mampuys et al.\nutilizing 2-MeTHF as solvent, see Scheme 66.357 Good to\nexcellent yields were observed across a wide variety of substrates\nincluding sterically hindered and electron-deficient compounds (Scheme 67). The Grignard reaction manifold\nrepresents a classical and key methodology\nfor C–C bond formation. Grignard reactions, at their simplest,\ninvolve the addition of an organomagnesium halide to a carbonyl\ncontaining molecule, forming a new C–C bond and an alcohol.\nThe reaction was discovered in 1900 by Victor Grignard, for which\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912.358 The reaction today is still widely employed and has even\nbeen conducted in the large scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and their intermediates.177 Grignard reactions have classically employed solvents of concern\nsuch as THF or diethyl ether, thus prompting the research group of\nZhang et al. to undertake a systematic study evaluating the performance\nof a variety of alternative and more sustainable solvents in Grignard-type\nreactions.177 It was demonstrated that\n2-MeTHF performed just as well or out-performed diethyl ether or THF\nin a wide variety of Grignard reactions including benzyl, aryl, and\nheteroaromatic Grignard reagents. CPME was also shown to be an appropriate\nsolvent when DIBAL-H instead of I2 was used as an initiator.\nA solvent comparison study for the formation of API tramadol was also\nconducted, see Scheme 64, with 2-MeTHF outperforming THF by +11% yield. After a performance\nevaluation and screening of solvents for a range of Grignard reactions,\nZhang et al. now recommend the use of 2-MeTHF as alternative solvent\nto Et2O and THF for the preparation of most Grignard reagents\nand their subsequent reactions, see Scheme 68. They noted that the use of 2-MeTHF was\nequal if not superior in suppressing the Wurtz coupling byproduct\nfrom benzyl Grignard reactions, see Table 13.177 The use of Reformatsky reagents in the large-scale synthesis of\nvarious enantiopure N-tert-butanesulfinyl trifluoromethyl\nβ-amino esters from bench-stable analogues of aliphatic and\naromatic trifluoromethyl N-tert-butanesulfinyl ketoimines\nwas reported by Grellepois, see Scheme 69. During optimization studies, it was found\nthat 2-MeTHF was the best solvent.359 The synthesis of enantioenriched\nalcohols via the Corey-Baskshi-Shibata\n(CBS) oxazaborolidine-mediated reduction of prochiral ketones was\ncarried out by Luisi and co-workers using a combination of flow technology\nand 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 70. The optimized conditions gave the desired asymmetric products\nin yields of up to 99% and 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), with a reaction\nduration 10 min.360 CPME, as discussed preciously in section 2, has been available\nin commercially useful\nquantities since 2005165 and has been utilized\nin a wide variety of reaction classes including organometallic mediated\ntransformations. A selection of examples highlighting some of the\nbreadth and scope of CPME employment in organometallic reactions will\nbe discussed in this section. In 2007, Okabayashi et al. developed\na facile method for the regio- and stereoselective preparation of\nketene trimethylsilyl acetals (KSAs) from t-butyl\nesters or ketoesters using strong bases such as LDA and NaHMDS, in\nconjunction with TMSCl, and CPME as solvent. The reactions were conducted\nunder mild conditions, 0–5 °C, 2.5 h and produced both\n(E)-KSAs and 1,3-bis(TMS)-KSAs, see Scheme 71.361 α-Oxygen and α -nitrogen-substituted t-butyl esters were also shown to be compatible with this methodology.\nDuring solvent screening for reaction condition optimization, it was\nshown that other ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, THF, 1,4-dioxane,\nand dimethoxyethane led to poor regioselectivity and C-silylation, whereas CPME by comparison outperformed all of these\nsolvents. CPME has also seen use as a\ncosolvent in conjunction with THF,\nsee Scheme 72. Takeda\net al. demonstrated that CPME was critical for a titanocene-mediated\nketone allylation strategy that gave access to alkyl systems containing\nadjacent stereocenters in high yield and high diastereoselectivity.362 CPME has also been used as a co-solvent (in\nconjunction with toluene) by researchers at Novartis who employed\nthe solvent as a stabilizer for a Grignard reagent during a reaction\nsequence.363 The stabilizing effect of CPME was once again\nexploited by Molander\net al. during their reaction optimization for the synthesis of azaborines.\nA 1:1 mixture of CPME:toluene was discovered to be optimum.364 Azaborines represent an important and emerging\nclass of potential isosteric replacements for traditional carbon containing\nheterocycles, and the methodology developed, Scheme 73, has allowed for facile synthesis using,\nat least in part, a more contemporary solvent. The Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is a classical\nmethod for the\nsynthesis of cyclopropanes from alkenes via insertion of a zinc carbene,\nsee Scheme 74. THF\nor diethyl ether is most often employed as solvent in this reaction\nmanifold, and in 2013, Fujii et al. conducted solvent screening to\ndetermine whether other alternative ethers could be used. It was demonstrated\nthat reactions conducted using CPME went to completion up to ten-times\nfaster than those in diethyl ether with no loss in product yield or\nselectivity. Yield improvements in some cases were also noted.365 In 2015, Pace et al. demonstrated that CPME was the optimum\nsolvent\nfor their synthesis of thioamides from the corresponding isothiocyanate\nand lithium reagent, see Scheme 75. Solvent screening showed CPME to be superior to traditional\nethers such as THF and diethyl ether and even outperformed 2-MeTHF\nin terms of yield. The methodology reported provides robust and efficient\naccess to secondary thioamides from commercially available isothiocyanates\nand includes examples where chiral isothiocyanates or organolithium\nreagents have been used to form enantiopure products with excellent\nselectivity. In 2016, a thorough investigation into the use\nof CPME in Grignard\nreactions was conducted by Kobayashi et al., see Scheme 76.345 It was shown that CPME can be used in place of THF to great effect\nand that DIBALH was the most effective method of activating the Mg\nwhen using CPME as solvent. Efficient solvent recycling of CPME was\nalso demonstrated with no loss of yield observed. Promisingly, CPME\nwas shown to be stable to Grignard reagents during long-term storage\nwith no solvent degradation observed. Furthermore, Grignard reagent\nstability in CPME was often in the order of many months; thus, CPME\ncould be used in commercial preparations of Grignard reagents.345 Ureas are used\nin agrochemicals, and in the pharmaceutical industry where they are\nfound in areas such as antibiotics, antimalarial compounds, antimicrobials,\nand many others. They have also been utilized as catalysts, ligands,\nand solvents, see Scheme 77. A greener, mild, and efficient\napproach for the synthesis of ureas,\nfrom isocyanates and secondary amines, was developed by Camp and co-workers\nusing the bioalternative solvent Cyrene, see Scheme 78.88 This method\nremoves the use of toxic solvents such as DMF, which has been used\nin the traditional synthesis of ureas. A simple workup procedure for\nthe removal of Cyrene was also established by the addition of water,\nwhich led to precipitation of the desired urea. The substrate scope\nof both the amine and isocyanate was investigated. Steglich\nesterification remains a commonly employed technique for the mild\nsynthesis of esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols or thiols.184,367 This methodology employs coupling reagents often encountered in\namide bond formation such as carbodiimides and relies heavily on either\nDCM or DMF as solvents of choice.8,367 Solvent-reagent\nselection guides for both ester and thioester synthesis have been\ndeveloped by Jordan et al. and effectively demonstrate the effective\nreplacement of dipolar aprotic solvents with safer, more sustainable\nalternatives, see Scheme 79. For the formation of thioesters from acids and thiols,\nit was found\nthat coupling reagent T3P in conjunction with solvent cyclopentanone\ngave good to excellent yields across a variety of building-block-like\nmolecules, often with rapid reaction times of just 1 h, see Scheme 79 (left). 2-MeTHF,\nEtOAc, DMC, and CPME were also shown to be viable alternatives, though\nless general in their applicability/compatibility to the substrates\nscreened.184 A solvent-reagent guide\nfor ester formation from alcohols and acids\nhas also been recently developed. In this study, a high-throughput\napproach allowed for the simultaneous identification of alternative\nsolvent DMC in conjunction with safer coupling reagent 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium\niodide (Mukaiyama’s reagent). Further optimized conditions\nwere identified from the initial screen and then successfully applied\nin the synthesis of a selection of building-block-like molecules,\nsee Scheme 79 (right).\nIn both studies, less desirable polar aprotic solvents were successfully\nreplaced with greener, safer, more sustainable alternatives. Steglich esterification in water has also been demonstrated by\nFattahi et al. using DIC as coupling reagent, though the methodology\nis limited to phenolic alcohols due to their lower pKa when compared to aliphatic alcohols in water.265 A range of peptide-based compounds are widely\nused globally, including\nclinically used hormones such as oxytocin, and peptide therapeutics.\nFrom 2015–2019, 208 new drugs were approved by the FDA, 15\nof which were peptides or peptide-containing molecules (7%).370 The increasing proportion of therapeutics falling\ninto the peptides category has been accompanied by a need for more\nsustainable methods for the solid phase synthesis of peptides (SPPS),\nsee Scheme 80. Commonly\nused solvents for SPPS fall within the reprotoxic dipolar aprotics\ncategory, being DMF, DMAc, and NMP.371 The\nchallenges in improving the sustainability in peptide synthesis and\npurification are well reviewed by Isidro-Llobet et al.372 Recently, a number of publications have aimed\nto move away from\nreprotoxic dipolar aprotic solvents in solid phase peptide synthesis,\nswitching to more sustainable alternatives. The work of Lawrenson\net al. has successfully demonstrated the use of propylene carbonate\nas a safer, more sustainable alternative to polar aprotic solvents\nsuch as DMF or NMP. In their publication, both SPPS and solution phase\nmethodology were successfully demonstrated using propylene carbonate\nas solvent with no significant impact on racemization of the amino\nacid (AA) observed. Synthesis of nonapeptide “Bradykinin”\nwas also demonstrated. NBP was identified by Novartis in 2018\nduring a systematic examination\nof 34 alternative solvents shortlisted as potential DMF replacements\nin SPPS.222 A number of parameters were\nexamined including solvent ability to swell resin, solubility of SPPS\nreagents, and reaction performance including Fmoc deprotection steps.\nNBP was successfully demonstrated as a viable drop-in replacement\nfor DMF; NBP was successfully used as the solvent during the SPPS\nsynthesis of an octapeptide with comparable yield and purity to that\nof DMF (93% yield NBP vs >99% DMF, 80% purity NBP vs 86% DMF).\nOne\nmajor point of difference was highlighted: NBP is more viscous than\nDMF (4.0 cP vs 0.8 cP) and makes for slower fluid transfer steps during\nsmaller scale SPPS operations.222 Two reports were published in 2020 in which the solvent NBP was\nused in place of traditional solvents. Kumar et al. have successfully\ndemonstrated the use of NBP as a replacement for DMF and NMP SPPS\noperations using both in situ activation and preactivation\nstrategies. Less racemization was observed for reactions conducted\nin NBP, and a reduction in the generation of side-products when forcing\nconditions were utilized was also observed. Thus, NBP has been demonstrated\nas a superior alternative to both DMF and NMP in this study.373 De la Torre et al. report the successful\nuse of NBP in an SPPS\nsequence employing problematic amino acid residue Fmoc-Arg (Pbf)–OH;\npbf = (2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl group).\nThe amino acid residue is particularly troublesome due to its propensity\nto react intramolecularly leading to δ-lactam side product.\nA systematic analysis of reaction conditions allowed for the identification\nof optimum conditions, and NBP was shown to be an excellent alternative\nsolvent to DMF, with levels of amino acid incorporation into the peptide\nbackbone approaching 100%. Purity of the crude peptides was also similar.374 From a safety perspective, it has been\nreported by Erny et al.\nthat the levels of HCN produced in DIC/Oxyma mediate amide bond forming\nreactions can be significantly reduced when a mixture of NBP:EtOAc\n1:4 is employed.375 In conjunction with\ndimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) as a HCN scrubbing additive, the authors\nsuggest that with further developments, the implementation of this\nmethodology combining greener solvents and HCN-free synthesis could\nbe applied to the industrial manufacturing of peptides. Other\nthan NBP, GVL has also been proposed as a potential alternative\nsolvent in SPPS. The group of Albericio and co-workers illustrated\nthat GVL could be utilized in polystyrene (PS)-based SPPS. GVL showed\nexcellent coupling efficiencies in both the synthesis of a pentapeptide\n(Aib-enkephalin) and decapeptide (Aib-ACP), with no major side products\nor ring opening products detected.376 A\nfollow-up to this work was published in 2019 demonstrating the effectiveness\nof GVL in Wang resin SPPS; DCM was effectively replaced as an alternative\nsolvent for the initial anchoring to the Wang resin. Subsequent elongation\nof the peptide was also successfully conducted in GVL with racemization\nand dipeptide formation found to be within acceptable levels.377 Both publications also note the compatibility\nof Fmoc residues in GVL. Most recently, Leko et al. have demonstrated\nthat a combination of EtOAc/CH3CN can be used in chlorotrityl\nchloride and 4-methylbenzhydryl bromide resin loading operations\nwith loading levels comparable to that when DCM, THF, 2-MeTHF, or\nDMF was utilized.378 In recent years,\nthere has been a significant expansion in the field of biocatalysis,\ncommonly using water as a solvent or cosolvent. However, there are\na number of problems associated with the use of water as a solvent\nin biocatalysis, even though it is readily available, is nonhazardous,\nand does not have the flammability or explosion risks associated with\norganic solvents.379 Many synthetically\nuseful reagents, those that are of interest in biocatalytic transformations,\nare poorly water-soluble, which in turn results in a requirement of\nextremely dilute reaction mixtures, leading to increased solvent use.\nThere has been a recent drive for discovery of enzymatic reactions\ncompatible with sustainable organic solvents, most notably 2-MeTHF380 and CPME.168 The most expansive class of enzymatic reaction using 2-MeTHF is that\nof hydrolases, mostly in stereoselective acylations for kinetic resolutions\nof racemates.381−383 In 2017, Secundo and co-workers reported\nthe use of 2-MeTHF in the esterification of a range of natural products\n(menthol, rac-sulcatol and rac-α-cyclogeraniol)\nusing a range of commercial lipases.384 2-MeTHF, as well as CPME, performed well compared to traditional\nsolvents such as toluene and MTBE, with high enantioselectivity. A\nsimilar enzymatic acylation of racemic benzoin in 2-MeTHF, reported\nby Alcántara and colleagues in 2011, using Pseudomonas\nstutzeri lipase (PSL) and Shvo’s catalyst, led to\nkinetic resolution over 48 h, in a 85% yield and 99% e.e. (Scheme 81).385 Numerous additional examples are also found\nwithin the literature using 2-MeTHF as an alternative bio-based solvent,\ntargeting selective acylations of glycosides.386−390 Away from kinetic resolutions, Pseudomonas stutzeri lipase (PSL) has additionally be used as an effective catalyst in\namination reactions of esters, reported by Wong et al. in 2011.391 Shown to form a wide range of alkyl and aryl\namides, 2-MeTHF was reportedly selected due to a high solubilizing\nability of the organic starting materials, with MTBE also shown to\nperform effectively in the transformation. A selection of papers\nusing 2-MeTHF as a bio-based solvent, for\naccessing chiral α-hydroxyketones through either carboligation392,393 or domino enzymatic reactions,394 have\nalso been reported. The first of which, by Domínquez de María\nin 2010, involved use of 2-MeTHF as a (co)solvent alternative to DMSO\nor MTBE for enantioselective C–C bond formation between aldehydes.\nCatalyzed by a thiamine diphosphate-dependent lyase (ThDP-Lyase),\nan efficient enantioselective carboligation of aldehydes to furnish\nchiral α-hydroxyketones was described, providing products in\n>90% yield and generally >95% e.e. (Scheme 82a). A similar report by Rother and co-workers\nin 2012 also used ThDP-Lyase for the umpolung carboligation\nof acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde, examining the relative product distribution\nof the eight possible enantiomeric products.393 (a) Carboligation of aldehydes\nto produce chiral α-hydroxyketones. (b) Domino enzymatic process\nfor the preparation of 2-HPP, with in situ generation\nof acetaldehyde via kinetic resolution. This\nwas further followed up in 2012 by a domino enzymatic cascade\nusing an aldehyde and butyrate or laurate substrate, in the presence\nof Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) and benzaldehyde\nlyase (BAL).394 An initial conversion of\nthe vinyl ester into acetaldehyde, followed by a subsequent C–C\nbond formation with benzaldehyde, catalyzed by BAL, furnished (R)-2-hydroxypropriophenone (2-HPP) in quantitative\nconversion and >99% e.e. (Scheme 82b). Although the majority of biocatalytic transformations\ncarried out\nin organic solvents such as 2-MeTHF fall under the hydrolases class\ndue to their high robustness, a small number of other enzymes are\nalso compatible. In 2014, metagenome screening by Kurokawa and colleagues\nidentified a dehydrogenase enzyme, homologous Leifsoniaadh alcohol\ndehydrogenase (HLADH), which was able to effectively reduce a selection\nof ketones, with high tolerance to 2-MeTHF, in excellent (generally\n>99%) enantiomeric excess.395 Similar\nketone\nreductions have been reported, for example, using YOL151W reductase396 and KREDs (Scheme 83).397 Other than 2-MeTHF, a solvent\n(or cosolvent) that has demonstrated\npotential within biocatalytic transformations is cyclopentyl methyl\nether (CPME). CPME, similar to 2-MeTHF, has proven effective in kinetic\nresolution, such as the one reported by González-Sabín\nand co-workers in 2017.398 As part of a\nkey step in the synthesis of Ivabradine, a drug used for the treatment\nof stable angina pectoris, alkoxycarbonylation kinetic resolution\nof an amine precursor was carried out using the lipase PSC-II and\ndiethylcarbonate, yielding the desired (S)-enantiomer\nin 30% yield, 92% e.e. (Scheme 84). The utility of CPME as a solvent in the reduction of imine-type\nfunctionalities, using IREDs (imine reductases), was reported by Rother\nand Maugeri in 2016.399 Reduction of cyclic\nC=N functionalities using whole cells containing Streptomyces\naurantiacus and Paenibacillus elgii B69\ngave an e.r. of >99:1 under micro aqueous reaction conditions (Scheme 85)."

      "title": "Amide Bond Formation",
      "text": "The amide moiety\nis abundant within drug molecules,259 and\namide coupling has been consistently highlighted as the most frequently\nemployed transformation in medicinal chemistry (Scheme 9, Scheme 10).260 Traditionally, amide\ncoupling has relied heavily on solvents with major regulatory issues\nsuch as dichloromethane and DMF, which are classed as solvents of\nconcern.44 On the basis of the importance\nof amide bond formation, it is pertinent that greener and more sustainable\nsolvent use should be explored whenever possible. Several examples of amide coupling reactions employing previously\ndiscussed sustainable alternatives to dipolar aprotics are discussed\nbelow. Recently, Camp and co-workers reported the synthesis of amides\nfrom acid chlorides and amines in the biobased solvent Cyrene.125 The substrate scope was investigated pertaining\nto both the acid chlorides and primary amines. Crucially, the addition\nof water allowed for precipitation of the product and facile isolation\nfrom the Cyrene solvent without the use of chromatography, see Scheme 9. Watson and co-workers\nhave also evaluated the use of Cyrene in the HATU-mediated synthesis\nof amides and peptides.119 It was found\nthat Cyrene was an effective replacement for DMF and NMP in the synthesis\nof lead-like molecules. Conditions were established that demonstrated\na broad functional group tolerance and broad generality after evaluating\n25 examples, with yields ranged from 63–100%, see Scheme 10. In 2017, Hunt\nand co-workers published an article comparing the utility of 2,2,5,5-tetramethyloxolane\n(TMO) in a series of reactions, one of being formation of an amide\nfrom phenylbutanoic acid and benzyl amine (Scheme 11), with traditional solvents\nsuch as toluene.103 In the studies, reaction\nkinetics analysis of the amide formation resulted in similar reaction\nrates to the effective toluene and p-cymene solvents,\nalthough the basicity (β) of TMO was similar to the less effective\nDMSO (Figure 28).\nAlso in this report is discussed the nature of ethers containing α-protons\nto the oxygen to form dangerous peroxides in solution, upon irradiation\nwith UV light. In a comparative irradiation experiment, traditional\nperoxide-forming ethers THF, 2-MeTHF, and diethyl ether formed varying\namounts of detectable peroxide over a period of six months, whereas\na solution of TMO stored under identical conditions formed no detectable\nperoxide. Reaction\nkinetic analysis for TMO (TMTHF)-mediated amide bond formation\nconducted by Byrne et al.103 Reproduced\nfrom ref (103) with\npermission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. Handa et al. have recently developed solvent-free methodology for\nfast and clean amide couplings in water that require no extraction,\nchromatography, or crystallization (Scheme 12).261 This is\nachieved by use of the l-proline-based amphiphile PS-750-M,\ndeveloped by the group.238 In the micelle\nof PS-750-M, the presence of 3° amides from the surfactant proline\nlinker structurally mimics DMF, NMP, and DMAc solvents. This allows\nextremely fast amide couplings, mediated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)\ncarbodiimide (EDC), rather than expensive and specialized coupling\nreagents. The conditions developed by the group result in the precipitation\nof the product and isolation by filtration. The methodology is also\nreproducible on different reaction scales. Mechanistic and kinetic\ninsights into PS-705-M mediated fast amide bond formation have also\nbeen provided.262 A similar approach to that of Handa et al. is that of the Lipshutz\ngroup, inventors of the α-tocopherol derived surfactant TPGS-750-M,55 who demonstrated in 2015 that amide bond formation\ncan be rapidly conducted in TPGS-750-M–water systems in high\nyields. Products are extracted from the surfactant–water system\nusing an organic solvent. The surfactant has been designed to be preferentially\nsoluble in aqueous layers leading to facile product recovery and ease\nof recyclability of the surfactant–water phase (5 cycles conducted)\nand low E-factors (organic solvent + water E factor = 7.8).263 Reaction times were typically 1–4 h,\nand yields of amino acid amide couplings to give dipeptides (19 compounds)\nranged from 84 to 99%. In 2013, Watson et al. published a solvent-reagent\nguide evaluating the use of greener alternatives to DMF and DCM for\namide bond formation. It was shown that reaction rates and yields\nfor alternative solvents such as dimethylcarbonate, EtOAc, and\n2-MeTHF were comparable to DCM and DMF and could be considered as\npractical alternatives for both academic and industrial use. CPME\nwas shown to be a poor alternative, most likely due to reaction mixtures\nbecoming heterogeneous as they progressed.264 Amidation in water using N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide\n(DIC) as coupling reagent has been effectively demonstrated by Fattahi\net al. with no requirement for surfactant additives.265 Both aromatic and aliphatic acids were shown to be compatible\nwith this methodology. Catalytic amide bond formation was reported\nby Coomber et al. in\n2019 using a combination of B(OCH2CF3)3 in tert-butyl acetate, see Scheme 13. Significantly, this methodology allows\nfor the coupling of unprotected amino acids in high yields. Scales\nof up to 100 mmol were demonstrated with product isolation achieved\nby resin catch and release protocols.266 Ultrafast amidation reactions using lithium\namides under aerobic\nconditions and ambient temperatures have recently been reported by\nFairley et al. under these conditions, amidation of ester starting\nmaterials. The reaction proceeds via C–O bond cleavage and\nis complete in just 20 s. Solvents employed were either 2-MeTHF or\nglycerol.267 High yields and good selectivity\nwere generally observed making this methodology an advancement in\naccessing carboxamides by sustainable means via air and moisture compatible\norganometallic chemistry. A further push toward substitution\nof regulated solvents used in\namidation reactions with more sustainable biobased solvents, such\nas p-cymene, was demonstrated by Clark and co-workers\nfrom the University of York in 2018 (Scheme 14).268 Discovery\nof a preferred alternative to toluene for this transformation (which\ncould also act as an alternative to dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMF) also removes concerns associated with reproductive toxicity.269 A direct comparison of yields for toluene and p-cymene in a silica-catalyzed amidation of carboxylic acids,\nacross a varied substrate scope of 13 amides, was performed. In the\nmajority of cases, p-cymene outperformed that of\ntoluene when carried out under reflux (bp 177 °C). This methodology\nhas further enhanced sustainability, with facile purification through\namide precipitation, recycling of solvents, and use of a reusable\nsolid-supported catalyst. Palladium\ncatalysis is used extensively in both industrial and academic synthetic\nchemistry laboratories as a powerful methodology for the formation\nof C–C bonds. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of organoboronic\nacids and their derivatives is the most frequently utilized palladium-catalyzed\nC–C bond forming reactions in the chemical industry, see Scheme 15.14 Traditionally, ethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and\nTHF or dipolar aprotics such as DMF are employed for a large proportion\nof these reactions.14 Owing to the frequent\nuse and importance of this reaction, there is great potential for\n“greener” solvent alternatives to have a significant\nimpact. Note that discussion surrounding the use of Suzuki-Miyaura\nreactions as a benchmark for the performance of new solvents suggests\nthat it is not the most informative reaction manifold.270 For example, cross-coupling can be successfully\nconducted in rapeseed oil and butter with both of these lipid-based\nsystems outperforming benchmark solvent DMF.271 Watson and co-workers developed a mild method\nfor the Suzuki-Miyaura\nreaction that employed Cyrene as a greener alternative to the commonly\nused dipolar aprotic solvents (Scheme 16).14 The reaction\nscope was extensively explored by varying both the organoboron nucleophile\nand aryl electrophile. The conditions developed demonstrated excellent\ngenerality and functional group tolerance. The group reported 57 examples\nwith yields ranging from 44 to 100%, from discovery to gram-scale\nreactions. Hunt et al. have explored the use of NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent\nfor Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 17.110 Yields for\na series of reactions performed in both NMP and NBP have been reported,\nto carry out a comparison, using a range of different substituted\naryl halides to explore the scope. Although the results showed that\nreactions using NMP as solvent gave better yields overall (76–90%\nfor model reactions utilizing 4-iodoacetophenone and a range\nof phenylboronic acids), reactions carried out in NBP still gave good\nyields (∼10% lower for the same model reaction), as seen in Table 5. However, the reactions\nhad not been optimized to specifically favor N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\nso there may also be potential to improve the performance of these\nreactions. Dimethyl isosorbide has been\ndemonstrated as an effective reaction\nmedium for several classical cross-coupling reactions. In 2018, Watson\net al. reported the use of DMI in several Suzuki-Miyaura reactions\n(12 substrates). In general, aromatics with various electron donating\nand withdrawing groups were tolerated as were variations in the electrophilic\ncomponent including vinyl groups, boronic acids, and pinacol esters.214 Reaction times were 1 h conducted at 60 °C\nwith 4 mol % Pd(dppf)Cl2, and yields ranged from 62 to\n>99%. Garg and co-workers have reported the nickel-catalyzed\nSuzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling between aryl halides and (hetero)aromatic boronic\nacids in a number of greener solvent alternatives.272 Initial solvent screening showed that EtOAc, iPrOH, 2-MeTHF,\nand t-amyl alcohol were all demonstrated to be excellent\nalternatives, see Scheme 18, to traditionally employed solvents such as toluene or 1,4-dioxane.\nThe reaction scope was further explored using 2-MeTHF and t-amyl alcohol as solvents. The scope was found to be broad\npertaining to both coupling partners, with heterocycles well tolerated\n(Scheme 18). The methodology\nwas demonstrated on multigram scales using low catalyst loadings (0.5–1.0\nmol % nickel) to provide desired products in reasonable to excellent\nyields. 2-MeTHF has also been successfully employed as reaction solvent\nin palladium–NHC-catalyzed amide and ester cleaving cross-coupling\nreactions.273 Following the emergence of eucalyptol as a sustainable,\nbioderived\nsolvent, the utility of it in cross-coupling reactions has been explored\nin a number of transformations by Berteina-Raboin and colleagues.205−207 When tested in palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling\nreactions of arylboronic acids with heteroaryl chlorides, eucalyptol\noutperformed reactions conducted in THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, with\nyields ranging from 44 to 99%. Reaction temperatures of 100 °C\nwere required for complete dissolution of reagents. The\nMizoroki-Heck cross-coupling, commonly referred to as the Heck cross-coupling,\ninvolves the reaction of an aryl halide with an alkene under Pd(0)/Pd(II)\ncatalysis. Common reaction solvents for the Heck reaction include\n1,4-dioxane, THF, and amide-based solvents such as DMF and DMAc, see Scheme 19. Although there\nare examples using more sustainable solvents such as water and acetonitrile,\nexpansion of the available green solvents for the transformation is\nunderway.110,214 Hunt et al. have explored the scope and limitations of the use\nof NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent for the Heck cross-coupling reaction,\nsee Scheme 20, in\naddition to Suzuki-Miyaura couplings.110 The group reported and compared the yields from a series of reactions\nperformed in both NMP and NBP. In summary, they found that the Heck\nreactions carried out in NBP gave comparable to or higher yields than\nthose carried out in NMP, see Table 6. This comparison has demonstrated that NBP was a viable\nreplacement to NMP as reaction solvent in the Heck cross-coupling\nreactions examined. Dimethyl isosorbide has also been\ndemonstrated as an effective\nreaction medium for the Mizoroki-Heck reaction by Watson et al.214 Optimized reaction conditions using 5 mol %\nPd(dppf)Cl2 were trialled on 12 substrates and showed that\nthe reaction proceeded well with aryl iodides and bromides facilitating\ncoupling of both electron poor and rich arenes with a variety of vinyl\nketones and acrylamides in 47–91% yield. Reactions were generally\nconducted at 80 °C for 1 h though some aryl bromide examples\nrequired heating at 115 °C for 24 h.214 Another alternative class of solvents shown to have utility\nin\nMizoroki-Heck cross-couplings reactions is that of cyclic carbonates,\nsee Figure 29. In\na study evaluating the use of a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents\nfor the transformation, Clark and colleagues demonstrated the effective\nuse of propylene and ethylene carbonate in the place of NMP and DMSO.107 In many cases, both cyclic carbonate solvents\nperformed as or more effectively than NMP across a wide substrate\nscope, tolerating substrates of various electronics.

Recently, Su et al.\nhave demonstrated that DMI could be effectively\nutilized in a Ni-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling of aryl bromides\nwith vinyl acetate (acting as a vinylating reagent).274 Moderate to excellent yields of the vinylated products\nwere observed across a wide and varied heteroaryl substrate scope,\nsee Scheme 21. The Sonogashira\ncross-coupling is a widely used palladium and copper-catalyzed process\nfor accessing functionalized alkyne species from terminal alkynes\nand aryl halides, see Scheme 22.275 Another powerful C–C\nbond forming reaction, the Sonogashira reaction is commonly performed\nin THF and DMF,276 both of which are problematic\ndue to peroxide formation and reprotoxicity, respectively. Because\nof the efficiency and widespread use of this reaction in both academia\nand industry, a search for greener solvent alternatives is highly\ndesirable. Cyrene has been successfully\nutilized by Watson et al. as reaction\nsolvent for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 23.127 Utilization of the safer, more sustainable Cyrene as an alternative\nto traditionally employed DMF127 was demonstrated\nacross a number of aryl and heteroaryl iodides and alkyne coupling\npartners. Broad tolerance to the optimized reaction conditions was\nobserved with yields of 65–99% generally reported, though yield\nvariability was observed for some electron deficient aryl bromides\n(28–99%). Further expansion of the methodology to Cacchi-type\nannulations furnished benzofuran and indole scaffolds in good to excellent\nyields (73–100%), see Scheme 24. Dimethyl isosorbide has been successfully utilized as\nreaction\nsolvent for the Sonogashira reaction by Watson et al. Twelve substrates\nwere synthesized using the same catalyst and base conditions as depicted\nin Scheme 23 (reactions\nwere conducted at 25 °C).214 A range\nof aryl iodides and bromides including electron rich and deficient\nexamples, and a number of functionalized alkynes including BMIDA and\nTIPS functionalities, were synthesized in 83–98% yields. One\nexample of a thiophenol derived alkyne was synthesized, though in\na lower yield of 65%.214 Cabri and\nco-workers have recently published an investigation into\nthe use of N-substituted-pyrrolidinone solvents,\nalong with a small number of others, as a reaction medium for the\nSonogashira coupling.276 Given the knowledge\nof the reprotoxicity problems associated with NMP,17 the safer and more sustainable species discussed, such\nas NBP (N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone) and NCP (N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidinone), were shown to outperform\nDMF and NMP following optimization of reaction conditions. In addition\nto the broad substrate scope (generally >90% isolated yields),\nthe\nmethodology was applied to the synthesis of Erlotinib, performing\na Sonogashira cross-coupling step in quantitative yield, without the\nneed for a CuI additive, see Figure 30.276 Yield comparison for\nmodel Sonogashira reaction conducted by Cabri\net al. using a variety of NMP/DMF drop-in replacements.276 In addition to the previously\nmentioned explorations of the utility\nof eucalyptol as a solvent in palladium-catalyzed processes, it was\nalso shown to be effective in Sonogashira cross-couplings.277 A slightly different system to regular Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, utilizing Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 and\nPCy3, without addition of CuI, furnished a range of cross-coupled\nproducts in moderate to good yields.277 It was noted that the cross-coupling of any heterocycles containing\nfree amine functionality, such as 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine is ineffective when using eucalyptol\nas the solvent; further investigations are required to optimize this\nprocess such that yields are comparable to those obtained using traditional\nSonogashira solvents such as DMF. Buchwald-Hartwig\namination is a widely employed cross-coupling strategy used for the\nformation of C–N bonds, see Scheme 25. Commonly used for substrates that are\nless reactive to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the palladium-catalyzed\ntransformation is also known to perform well with oxygen and sulfur\nnucleophiles.278,279 1,4-Dioxane is commonly utilized\nas reaction solvent for these transformations, and 1,4-dioxane has\nserious issues and is regarded as a solvent of concern.280 A number of strategies\nto overcome this issue include reactions\nconducted solvent-free,281 in water,282 or using water–surfactant systems.55 In 2014, the Lipshutz group published methodology\ndescribing Buchwald-Hartwig amination using the TPGS-750-M surfactant–water\nsystem, see Scheme 26. In 2020, Manikandan and co-workers\nopted for the use of 2-MeTHF\nin the synthesis of a triazolo-pyridazine-6-yl-substituted via a Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-coupling.283 The 2-MeTHF was used\nas the solvent in the final stage of the synthesis for 12 medicinally\nrelevant antidiabetic compounds, and yields were reported in the range\nof 92–98% using a catalytic combination of 10 mol % Pd2(dba)3/XPhos, in the presence of NaOtBu at room temperature for 4 h, see Scheme 27. The use of a surfactant however is not always necessary, and aqueous\nsingle or two-phase systems have been known in the Pd-catalyzed amination\nmanifold.284 Further exploration into aqueous\nsystems has also been conducted and was well documented by Buchwald\net al. in 2003.285 Water has also\nbeen successfully utilized as reaction solvent in\nrelated Cu-catalyzed Ullman-type reactions,286 as have other safer solvents such as tBuOH.287 Solvent-free examples are also known.288 Bio-based solvent eucalyptol has also been studied\nfor its potential\nuse as solvent in the Buchwald-Hartwig amination, see Scheme 28. A number of model reactions\nwere examined encompassing a variety of bromoarenes and amines and\nanilines. Moderate to excellent yields were obtained (43–99%),\nin many cases better than the reported yields for the analogous reaction\nconducted in a conventional dipolar aprotic solvent.289 Ma et al. have demonstrated\nthat tBuOH could be\neffectively used as an alternative to 1,4-dioxane in the cross-coupling\nof amino acid esters with aryl bromides and chlorides, see Scheme 29.290 The methodology was not just limited to α-amino acids\nbut also included β-, γ-, and δ-, proteinogenic,\nand nonproteinogenic amino acids. Products were prepared generally\nin moderate to high yields with retention of optical activity. Other\nexamples utilizing tBuOH in Pd catalyzed C–N\nhave also been reported,291 and alcohols,\nsuch as iPrOH, have also seen use in Pd-catalyzed\nC–N and C–O bond forming reactions.292 Solvent-free, ball milling conditions have been described\nby Shao et al. in 2018.293 A solvent selection guide for conducting acyl Buchwald-Hartwig\ntransamidation reactions has recently been compiled by Lei et al.\nIn their study, an exhaustive solvent screen of alternative solvents\nhas been conducted including 2-MeTHF, CPME, GVL, anisole, and p-cymene, see Scheme 30.294 1,2-Dimethoxyethane\nwas used as a benchmark solvent, giving 86% yield in the same transformation.\nBoth 2-MeTHF and MTBE showed excellent generality and applicability\nacross a wide range of transamidation coupling partners demonstrated\nthrough a substrate screen consisting of a variety of anilines and\namides bearing EDGs and EWGs. Thus, dipolar aprotics of concern in\nthese reactions such as THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane can be effectively\nreplaced by a drop-in alternative.294 Because of\nthe widespread use of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, and variants thereof,\nin synthetic and medicinal chemistry,14 and the requirement for a boronic acid or boronate coupling partner,\nsustainable methods for accessing these moieties are highly desirable.\nTraditional methods for preparation of boronic acids and boronates,\nsuch as the Miyaura borylation (Scheme 31), require dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMSO, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane.295 Recently, advancements have been made toward more sustainable\nsolvents\nfor borylation reactions, with cyclic ethers and cyclic ketones being\nused as substitutes. A recent publication by Frantz and co-workers\ndescribes a sustainable method for accessing arylboronic acids from\npseudohalides and B2(OH)4 using a 0.01 mol %\npalladium catalyst loading in a 1:1 mixture of 2-MeTHF and MeOH, see Scheme 32.296 Also described is a direct one-pot conversion of aryl halide\nto the boronic acid diethanolamine (DEA) adduct, providing synthesis\nof boronate species less susceptible to protodeboronation.297 This transformation is well-tolerated for aryl\nand (hetero)aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides, with yields ranging\nfrom 60–85%, on the choice of catalyst, (AtaPhos)2PdCl2 or XPhos-Pd-G3. The effectiveness of the methodology\nis demonstrated by a one-pot tandem borylation-Suzuki sequence, furnishing\na diverse range of C–C coupled products with no more than 2\nmol % palladium used for the overall two-step process. Many more examples\nof greener palladium-catalyzed borylations of aryl halides using B2(OH)4 or B2pin2 are known\nin 2-MeTHF298 and CPME.299 Although not as widely used as aryl and hetero(aryl)boronic\nacids and boronates, alkenyl boronates have important applications\nin Diels–Alder cycloadditions, as precursors to cyclopropyl\nboronates, and as effective radical acceptors.300 Recently, a number of publications have highlighted the\nuse of sustainable solvents in borylation reactions of alkynes, both\nrhodium301 and copper-catalyzed.302 A publication by Hutzler and co-workers in\n2017, outlining routes to the synthesis of herbicides, included a\nrhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with HBpin, with a solvent\nchoice of cyclohexanone.301 The reaction,\ncarried out below room temperature (18 °C), yielded the desired Z-alkene in 52% yield after 2 h (Scheme 33). Similarly, a publication by Woźniak and co-workers in 2019,\nshowcasing the utility of copper-NHC complexes containing sulfone\nand sulfoxide side-chains, describes a low catalyst loading (0.05\nmol %) hydroboration of alkynes, using CPME as the solvent, with a\nMeOH additive (10:1), see Scheme 34.302 In this instance, CPME\noutperforms both isopropanol and toluene, and the catalytic system\napplies to both alkynes (yielding alkenyl boronates) and alkenes (yielding\nalkyl boronates). Yields for all substrates studied are in excess\nof 95%, proving the methodology a very powerful and sustainable way\nto hydroborate alkynes and alkenes. In addition to solvent swaps to\nCPME, 2-MeTHF, and cyclohexanone, MTBE has also been shown to be highly\neffective in borylation sequences. Reported in 2009, Marder and co-workers\nutilized the solvent in a one-pot C–H borylation/Suzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling sequence, a transformation shown to be highly effective\nfor both aryl and heteroaryl substrates.174 Borylation in protic solvents such as MeOH303 and EtOH304 has also been reported including\nin the 2020 report on transition metal-free borylation of aryl halides\nusing bis-boronic acid in MeOH.305 The direct\nactivation and functionalization of C–H bonds, which avoids\nthe installation of intermediate functional groups, is both step-\nand atom-efficient, see Scheme 35. However, the sustainability of C–H activation\nis hindered (especially for large-scale chemistry) by numerous factors,\none of these being the introduction of safer, greener, and more sustainable\nsolvents. In many examples of chemistry involving C–H activation,\ngreen solvents have been too easily overlooked in preference to solvents\nsuch as THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, which have been frequently used.306 The inclusion of safer solvents such as 2-MeTHF\n(and exploring less conventional PEG or aqueous-micellar systems)\nduring reaction optimization and solvent screening is therefore critical\nif the field of C–H activation is to migrate away from solvents\nof concern. Reviews on the subject of emerging unconventional organic\nsolvents for C–H bond activation have been published in 2019\nby Gandeepan et al.,307 in 2020 by Yu et\nal.,308 and in 2021 by Dhawa et al.309 and Dalton et al.306 We direct the reader toward these bodies of work for further information\nand specific examples. The 2-MeTHF was used as a replacement to THF and 1,4-dioxane by\nAckerman and co-workers in a mild C–H activation of allenes\nusing a Fe(0) phosphine catalyst (Scheme 36).310 Across\na selection of aryl substrates containing an α-ketone directing\ngroup, efficient C–H functionalization using Fe(PMe3)4 yielded a diverse range of products in good to excellent\nyields. Also demonstrated was a tolerability of hydroxyl, amino, and\nalkoxycarbonyl moieties, in addition to mechanistic and computational\ninvestigations. The bioderived solvent eucalyptol has also been shown to have utility\nas a solvent for direct C–H arylations by Berteina-Raboin and\ncolleagues.277 Following synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines from the corresponding 2-aminopyridine\nand 2-bromoacetophenone derivatives, Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed\ndirect C–H arylation at the C-3 position using bromobenzene\nin eucalyptol yielded the desired arylated product in 60% (5 mol %\ncat.) and 61% yields (10 mol % cat.) after 24 h at 150 °C, see Scheme 37. Other bio-based\nsolvents such as cumene have also been promoted as a potential solvent\nfor C–H bond activation chemistry.308 A regioselective C–H functionalization of 1,2,3-triazoles\nin GVL was accomplished by Vaccaro and co-workers in continuous flow,\nsee Scheme 38. Across\n8 substrates, excellent yields (79–91%) of the cyclized product\nwere obtained, with solvent recovery and reuse, without further purification,\nalso demonstrated.311 Kakiuchi and co-workers developed a Ru-catalyzed stereoselective\nC–H arylation of ortho-methoxylated acetophenones and C–H\nmonoarylation of ortho-unsubstituted acetophenones in high yields\nusing cyclohexanone as solvent, see Scheme 39. Note: styrene was utilized as a necessary\nadditive to selectively provide monoarylation.312,313 Aqueous surfactant systems such as TPGS750M-H2O have\nalso been successfully utilized in ruthenium-catalyzed C–H\narylation reactions.314 PEG-based systems have been demonstrated as promising alternatives\nto conventional solvents as evidenced by Ackermann et al., who first\nshowed in 2009 that PEG-20000 could be used as solvent for either\nRu- or Pd-catalyzed direct arylation chemistry.315 This discovery has led to other PEG-derived systems such\nas that demonstrated by Reddy et al.316 who showed that PEG-400 was an excellent solvent for Cu-mediated\ncross-coupling of oxadiazoles with dibromoalkenes, see Scheme 40. When conventional\nsolvents such as CH3CN and DCM were screened instead of\nthe PEG, no reaction took place. The t-butyl carbamate (Boc)\ngroup is a common protecting group for amines,\nmost often utilized in multistep syntheses due to its stability under\na wide range of reaction conditions. One of the most common methods\nof deprotection typically employs 4 M HCl in 1,4-dioxane, a solvent\nit would be good to replace when possible, see Scheme 41. Commercially available alternatives to 1,4-dioxane\npreparations\nof HCl are available in safer, more sustainable solvents including\nethereal alternative CPME.317 Given the\nincreasing availability of HCl solutions in more sustainable solvents,\nit is recommended that alternative mixtures are considered before\nopting to use HCl in 1,4-dioxane. Several examples throughout the\nliterature demonstrate the utility of more sustainable methods for\nBoc deprotections, as part of lengthy syntheses. As part of\nthe design and testing of a sustainable methodology\nfor an improved Pinner reaction in CPME, Torisawa and co-workers discuss\nthe use of a 4 M solution of HCl in CPME for the deprotection of a\nBoc-protected amino acid derivative.318 Stirring of the derivative for 6 h at 0 °C provided the desired\ndeprotected amine in 97% yield, with the workup procedure also employing\nthe greener solvent. A common alternative acidic medium for the deprotection\nof Boc groups involves the use of CF3CO2H, trifluoroacetic\nacid (TFA). The use of TFA within a sustainable solvent was demonstrated\nas part of a peptide coupling by North et al. in 2017, in which the\nfinal Boc deprotection step used a solution of TFA in propylene carbonate,\nsee Scheme 42.319 Use of this combination provided sequential\ndeprotection yields between 80 and 99% yields in the three individual\nBoc deprotection steps in the multistep synthesis of tetrapeptides. An additional example demonstrating the deprotection of a Boc group\nwas reported in a Pfizer patent in 2005.320 Instead of using TFA or HCl, a biphasic mixture of sodium tert-butoxide in H2O/2-MeTHF provided improved\nconditions for the deprotection of a range of heterocyclic substrates\nwith medicinal applications, see Scheme 43.158 Aldehydes, amides, esters, and carboxylic\nacids are abundant groups\nin synthetic organic chemistry, whether as part of a reaction intermediate\nor pharmaceutically relevant scaffold. Traditional methods for the\npreparation of such species include hydroformylations of alkenes and\namide couplings, to name a few, which often require toxic heavy metals,321 pyrophoric organometallic reagents,322 or allergenic amide coupling reagents.323 In recent years there has been a shift toward\ncatalytic methodologies including palladium-catalyzed formylations\nand carbonylations of aryl halides using carbon monoxide gas or surrogates\nthereof.324 Unfortunately, use of the gas\nis often accompanied by the use of dipolar aprotic solvents such as\nDMF,325 see Schemes 44 and 45, or 1,4-dioxane,326 see Scheme 46, to aid the solubility of the gas in the reaction\nmedium.327 Recently, there has been interest in substituting reprotoxic dipolar\naprotic solvents with more sustainable alternatives for carbonylation\nreactions. One of the alternative solvents for such transformations\nhas been the cellulose-derived solvent GVL. In 2016, initial exploratory\nwork into the use of biomass-derived solvents by Mika and colleagues\nrevealed the utility of GVL in the aminocarbonylation of aryl\nhalides under CO(g), see Scheme 47.328 In a system catalyzed\nby Pd(OAc)2/PPh3, it was shown that a mixture\nof the carboxamide and ketocarboxamide products could be obtained,\nand relative ratio of the ketocarboxamide could be favored by\nincreasing of CO(g) pressure, see Table 7.328 Following\non from this initial work, the group later published\na palladium-catalyzed carbonylative esterification of aryl iodides\nwith a wide range of alcohols in 2020.329 Again using GVL, the transformation provided a wide range of ester\nproducts with significantly improved yields compared to the previous\naminocarbonylation,328 ranging from\n39 to 99% with phenol coupling partners and 13–99% with alkyl\nalcohol coupling partners, see Scheme 48.329 In 2019, Schwab and co-workers\nreported a simple and efficient\naminocarbonylation process to access 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides\nfrom the related heteroaryl iodide species.330 The Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed process involved in situ generation of CO(g) using a combination of H2SO4 and HCO2H within CO-ware equipment.\nUtilizing the sustainable solvent dimethyl carbonate, a variety of\nfunctionalized 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides were produced, with yields\nranging from 33 to 98% (Scheme 49).330 In the area of carboxylation reactions, in 2015, Levacher\nand co-workers\nreported a sustainable carboxylation of organic (heteroaryl, alkenyl,\nand allyl) halides in 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 50.331 Using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl formate as a CO2(g)\nsurrogate, and in the process eliminating the requirement for a high\nCO2-solubilizing dipolar aprotic solvent and opting for\nthe use of 2-MeTHF, a wide range of N-hydroxysuccinimide\nesters were accessible (Scheme 50). The methodology was shown to be effective in the\ncarboxylation of a functionalized quinoline intermediate in the preparation\nof a number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, with\nthe transformation progressing in 82% isolated yield.331 Metal-catalyzed hydroamination of styrenes has recently been reported\nby Mulks et al., see Scheme 51. In their work, the conventional wisdom of air- and moisture-free\norganometallic reactions is challenged by their demonstration of hydroamination\nof aryl alkenes in 2-MeTHF using lithium amides, see Table 8. Reactions were open to air\nand moisture and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Yields were\nmoderate to excellent with some incompatibility observed when using\nstyrenes containing aryl halide moieties.332 Remarkably, the presence of adventitious moisture was shown to be\nbeneficial and not detrimental. Reactions were accelerated by moisture,\nwhich generated free amine in situ at a steady rate.332 Sodium amides were also shown to be compatible\nwith the methodology. In 2020, a publication by Gevorgyan et al.\ninvestigated the utility\nof newly discovered biomass-sourced solvents in carboxylation reactions.208 In an overall transformation for the hydrocarboxylation\nof alkenes, via a boronate species from an initial hydroboration with\n9-BBN, sustainable solvents including eucalyptol, dimethyl isosorbide\n(DMI), and GVL were screened, see Scheme 52. Given that the process occurs via a boronate\nspecies, the effectiveness of the secondary carboxylation of boronic\nacid pinacol esters, Bpins, was also explored. For the overall hydrocarboxylation\nof 4-methylstyrene, 2-MeTHF, eucalyptol, DMI, and GVL were all found\nto outperform dipolar aprotics of concern including THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nsee Table 9. The hydroboration\nmethodology was not restricted to just benzylic alkenes, that is,\nstyrenes.208 For the conversion of phenyl Bpin to the corresponding phenyl carboxylic\nacid, of the general type depicted in Scheme 53, DMI was found to outperform THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nwith 2-MeTHF and (+)-rose oxide also notably performing above 70%\nyield (Table 10).\nIn addition to these two reactions, the solvents were comparatively\nscreened for numerous other carboxylation processes including transition\nmetal-catalyzed carboxylations (copper, zirconium, iron, and nickel).208 The Cu-catalyzed carboyxylation methodology\nwas further applied toward the synthesis of active pharmaceutical\ningredients Fenoprofen (60% yield) and Flurbiprofen (53% yield). Pd-catalyzed alkoxy- and amino-carbonylation and aryl bromide/boronic\nacid carbonylation in greener more sustainable solvents has been recently\ndemonstrated by Ismael et al.333 Sixteen\npotentially safer, more sustainable solvents were included during\nsolvent screening investigations including dipolar aprotic alternatives\nsuch as DMI, GVL, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, and\nether 2-MeTHF. It was found that aminocarbonylation proceeded\nwell in DMC while alkoxycarbonylation was successfully conducted\nin DMC and 2-MeTHF.333 Lastly, a\nvery recent report by Elorriaga and colleagues disclosed\na hybrid synthetic method in which an aluminum-catalyzed fixation\nof carbon dioxide in 2-MeTHF led to conversion of epoxides into tertiary\nalcohols.334 This process, catalyzed by\nAlEt2(κ2-bpzbdeape) (bpzbdeape = 1,1-bis(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethan-1-ol),\nresults in insertion of CO2 into one of the epoxide C–O\nbonds and subsequent ring expansion to form 5-membered cyclic carbonates\nin a near-quantitative yield. These cyclic carbonates, derived from\nthe structure of the starting epoxide, are then treated with 5 equiv\nof an alkyllithium reagent (e.g., EtLi), resulting in rapid conversion\nto the trialkyl alcohol. This methodology highlights an efficient\nmethod for the fixation of carbon dioxide to produce a range of highly\nsubstituted tertiary alcohols in one pot (Scheme 54).334 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution, or SNAr, is one of the most commonly used classes of reaction for\nsynthesis of aryl and heteroaryl ring systems, see Scheme 55.260 Because of the ease of reaction, including room temperature procedures,\nhigh-yielding transformations, and the ability to predict regioselectivity,335 the popularity of this reaction class has significantly\nincreased in the previous 30 years.260 Although\nthere are many examples using sustainable solvents in SNAr reactions, incidences using solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and THF\nare also prevalent within the literature.336,337 In the previous 5 years, a number of advances\nhave been made toward\nthe use of novel, sustainable solvents in nucleophilic aromatic substitution\nreactions (SNAr). In 2019, Szekely and co-workers discussed\nthe use of novel solvent PolarClean alongside other greener alternatives\n(GVL, Cyrene, and propylene carbonate) in a selection of reaction\nclasses including SNAr reactions.104 Using model reactions for the substitution of phenol or benzimidazole\non substrate bis(4-fluorophenyl) sulfone, comparisons between the\nsustainable solvents and more traditional alternatives of concern\n(DMAc, toluene) were explored, see Scheme 56. Using phenol, the more favorable alternatives\nperformed effectively compared to DMAc/toluene (86–92% compared\nto 70%) though were slightly less effective using benzimidazole (77–87%\ncompared to 97%), see Table 11. Studying the use of Cyrene-derived solvents such as\nthose falling\ninto the Cygnet class, Clark and colleagues at the University of York\nexplored the substitution of these solvents in nucleophilic aromatic\nfluorination reactions of pyridines.66 In\nthe study, which also involved use in other reaction classes, kinetic\ninvestigations in the fluorination of 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine using\na Cygnet 0.0 and a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents were carried\nout. Cygnet 0.0 resulted in higher reaction rates that MeCN and NMP,\nwith comparable rates to DMF.66 A small\nselection of publications in the previous 5 years have opted for a\nstraight solvent swap of the disfavored THF for the more sustainable\nalternative 2-MeTHF, mostly focusing on SNAr reactions\nfor medicinal chemistry applications. While investigating Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-couplings, Buchwald and Smith discovered that in a small number\nof cases when coupling secondary amines with the model substrate,\nthe reaction in 2-MeTHF proceeded effectively under noncatalyzed conditions.338 In the design of a greener synthetic route\nto an EGFR receptor inhibitor, McWilliams and co-workers from Pfizer\nsubstituted THF for 2-MeTHF in a key SNAr step, yielding\nthe desired product in 90% yield, see Scheme 57.339 A report by Parmentier et al.\nin 2016 demonstrated the utility\nof surfactant-based amphiphiles in the synthesis of a pharmaceutically\nrelevant API.340 Looking to enhance the\nfirst generation route for synthesis, the group explored the use of\nTPGS-750-M in water over the 5-step synthesis, with the primary step\ninvolving an SNAr reaction of an amine fragment and an\n(hetero)aryl electrophile (structures likely withdrawn from the publication\ndue to intellectual property restraints). For this SNAr\nstep, a switch from organic solvents to a surfactant–water\nsystem resulted in a slightly diminished yield of 75% compared to\n87%, but for the overall 5-step route, the process mass intensity\n(PMI) of the process was decreased by 32%.340 More recently, Berteina-Raboin and co-workers explored the\nuse\nof the widely available PEG-400 (polyethylene glycol) as a solvent\nin nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, see Scheme 58.341 The reaction was shown to perform effectively, using a range of\naliphatic and aromatic amines, on medicinally relevant substrate classes\nincluding imidazo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazines. For the wide ranging substrate scope, yields are\nreported in the range of 70–99%.341 Various PEG variants have also been successfully applied in many\nmetal-mediated reactions including oxidation, reduction, cross-coupling,\nand polymerization. This subject has been well reviewed by Colacino\net al.342 Often, organic solvents\ncan be replaced entirely from SNAr type chemistry. In 2013,\nWalsh et al. demonstrated that several\nSNAr reactions comprising heteroaryl chlorides such as\npyrimidine, pyrazine, and quinazoline could be conducted in water\nin the presence of KF. Surprisingly, several transformations that\nwere previously reported in the literature as requiring transition\nmetal catalysis were able to be conducted free from Pd.343 Organometallic-based\nreactions, such as those involving the use of alkyl lithium reagents,\nGrignard reagents, and metal hydride reductions, are commonly carried\nout in ethereal solvents and hydrocarbons due to the need for stability\nunder basic conditions.204,344 The most commonly\nused solvents within this class include diethyl ether, THF, and 1,4-dioxane,\nall of which are solvents of concern, see Figure 31.8 In recent\nyears, as a solution to the ongoing issues surrounding these solvents,\n2-MeTHF158,160 and CPME345 have\nboth been proposed as sustainable alternative solvents in a range\nof organometallic reactions, key examples of which will be discussed\nin this section. A number of commonly employed organometallic reagents\nare also now available as commercial preparations in alternative solvents\nsuch as 2-MeTHF.346 Organometallic reagents\nand their commonly employed ethereal solvents. 2-MeTHF\nhas been successfully utilized in a multitude of organometallic\nreactions, often acting as a “drop in” replacement for\nTHF or 1,4-dioxane. In 2010, Carbone et al. demonstrated that 2-MeTHF\ncould be used as solvent in asymmetric deprotonation reactions where\na chiral amine anion base is prepared in situ. Remarkably,\nthe chiral nature of the amine base is critical for enantioselectivity\nin asymmetric lithiation reactions when THF or 2-MeTHF are used as\nsolvent; anion bases derived from (−)-sparteine proceeded with\nlow enantioselectivity, whereas when a (+)-sparteine surrogate was\nemployed, excellent selectivity was observed.347 When MTBE was employed as solvent, excellent enantioselectivity\nwas observed for both sparteine bases, see Table 12 and Scheme 59. The selectivity is explained by the authors\nthrough a series of experiments investigating the solution phase dimerization\nand organization of the lithium base solvent complexes. The (+)-sparteine\nsurrogate used is (+)-(1R,2S,9S)-11-methyl-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7tridecane]. Mild, chemoselective N-TBS\nprotection of anilines\nhas been reported by Pace et al. using 2-MeTHF as a direct replacement\nfor THF. Under their optimized reaction conditions, TBS protection\nof aniline was conducted at 0 °C in just 30 min using MeLi and\nTBDMSCl in excellent yields (88–98%, 15 examples). Excellent\nchemoselectivity was also observed when iodo and bromo anilines were\nutilized as substrates; no lithium-halogen exchange was observed when\nusing 2-MeTHF as solvent but exchange did occur when using diethyl\nether. Finally, site selective TBS protection of aniline nitrogen\nover alkylamino nitrogen atoms was demonstrated, see Scheme 60. When using THF or diethyl\nether, a 1:1 mixture was observed. This remarkable selectivity has\nbeen proposed by the authors as being due to a reduction in the amount\nof highly polar amine dianion formed in 2-MeTHF due to the solvent’s\npolarity.348 Additionally, the authors\nundertook an examination of deprotection conditions showing that it\nwas possible to deprotect the TBS protected anilines in near quantitative\nyield in 2 h by simply stirring the compounds in a suspension of silica\ngel in an ethanol:water mixture (1:5). Note: −50 °C\nused here instead of 0 °C. The utility\nof 2-MeTHF in LiBr mediated selective 1,2-additions\nof organolithium reagents to α,β-unsaturated imines, ketones,\nand aldehydes to give a variety of allylic alcohols and amines has\nbeen demonstrated.349 Notably, no 1,4-addition\nproducts were detected by 1H NMR, and the reactions were\nconducted at 0 °C making this an attractively simple method.\nAnalogous reactions conducted in THF took longer and gave poorer yields\nwhen compared to 2-MeTHF (e.g., 6 h 79% yield vs 2 h quantitative\nyield for the 1,2 addition of MeLi to cyclohexenone), see Scheme 61. Other lithium base mediated reactions that have been successfully\nconducted in 2-MeTHF include preparations of γ-hydroxy-α,β-acetylenic\nesters using the base lithium tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP).350 Once more, Pace et al. have demonstrated the\nsuperior utility of 2-MeTHF through their exhaustive screening of\nhydrocarbon and ethereal solvents in the reaction of methyl-2-bromoacrylate\nwith benzaldehyde in the presence of a strong alkyllithium base, see Scheme 62. The 2-MeTHF gave\na 94% yield of the desired alcohol in just 1.5 h at −40 °C\ncompared to THF, which gave just 67% under the same conditions. Efficient access decorated four- and six-membered sulfur containing\nheterocycles (i.e., thietanes and thiopyrans) have also been achieved\nthrough a lithiation electrophile trapping strategy using 2-MeTHF\nas solvent, see Scheme 63. The 2-MeTHF was shown to improve regioselectivity considerably\nover THF.351 A wide range of benzylic and\naliphatic electrophiles were utilized, and varying degrees of electrophile\ndependent stereocontrol were observed. Other areas of organometallic chemistry in which 2-MeTHF has seen\nutility include zirconium chemistry such as that employing Schwartz’s\nreagent ((C5H5)2ZrHCl). Schwartz’s\nreagent in the presence of 2-MeTHF has been used to reduce isocyanates\nto formamides under mild conditions with excellent chemoselectivity\nand stereoretention of chiral substrates observed (room temperature,\n1 h), see Scheme 65.352 THF gave\nslightly poorer yields of about −5% during solvent screening\nreaction development. Similarly, Schwartz’s reagent can be\nutilized to reduce isothiocyanates to thioformamides.351 Electron withdrawing groups attached to the\naromatic isocyanates were also well tolerated including reactive functional\ngroups such as azo and azide motifs.353 The use of 2-MeTHF and the use of an in situ generated\nSchwartz reagent as the hydride source were crucial for obtaining\nhigh chemocontrol.354 Schwartz’s reagent\nis prepared in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and LiAl(O-t-Bu)3H, that is, Snieckus protocol. Subtle differences in the solubilizing and stabilizing\neffect of\n2-MeTHF have been effectively leveraged by Lelo et al., who have successfully\nemployed this solvent to promote α-elimination of lithium halide\nsalts to carbenoids, that is, Kirmse’s α-elimination.\nTaking advantage of the unique properties of 2-MeTHF, LiX salts have\nbeen degraded to carbenoids and reacted in situ with\nepoxides to give β-halohydrins. Employing THF or diethyl ether\nunder the same conditions helps to stabilize the lithium salts, and\nthe transformations were poorly accommodated by these more stabilizing\nsolvents.355 Other uses of ICH2X include the NaBH4-mediated reduction of diselenides\nin the presence of ICH2F to give α-fluoromethyl selenoethers.356 Synthesis of secondary amides from phenyl\nthiocarbamates and commercially\navailable Grignard reagents has been demonstrated by Mampuys et al.\nutilizing 2-MeTHF as solvent, see Scheme 66.357 Good to\nexcellent yields were observed across a wide variety of substrates\nincluding sterically hindered and electron-deficient compounds (Scheme 67). The Grignard reaction manifold\nrepresents a classical and key methodology\nfor C–C bond formation. Grignard reactions, at their simplest,\ninvolve the addition of an organomagnesium halide to a carbonyl\ncontaining molecule, forming a new C–C bond and an alcohol.\nThe reaction was discovered in 1900 by Victor Grignard, for which\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912.358 The reaction today is still widely employed and has even\nbeen conducted in the large scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and their intermediates.177 Grignard reactions have classically employed solvents of concern\nsuch as THF or diethyl ether, thus prompting the research group of\nZhang et al. to undertake a systematic study evaluating the performance\nof a variety of alternative and more sustainable solvents in Grignard-type\nreactions.177 It was demonstrated that\n2-MeTHF performed just as well or out-performed diethyl ether or THF\nin a wide variety of Grignard reactions including benzyl, aryl, and\nheteroaromatic Grignard reagents. CPME was also shown to be an appropriate\nsolvent when DIBAL-H instead of I2 was used as an initiator.\nA solvent comparison study for the formation of API tramadol was also\nconducted, see Scheme 64, with 2-MeTHF outperforming THF by +11% yield. After a performance\nevaluation and screening of solvents for a range of Grignard reactions,\nZhang et al. now recommend the use of 2-MeTHF as alternative solvent\nto Et2O and THF for the preparation of most Grignard reagents\nand their subsequent reactions, see Scheme 68. They noted that the use of 2-MeTHF was\nequal if not superior in suppressing the Wurtz coupling byproduct\nfrom benzyl Grignard reactions, see Table 13.177 The use of Reformatsky reagents in the large-scale synthesis of\nvarious enantiopure N-tert-butanesulfinyl trifluoromethyl\nβ-amino esters from bench-stable analogues of aliphatic and\naromatic trifluoromethyl N-tert-butanesulfinyl ketoimines\nwas reported by Grellepois, see Scheme 69. During optimization studies, it was found\nthat 2-MeTHF was the best solvent.359 The synthesis of enantioenriched\nalcohols via the Corey-Baskshi-Shibata\n(CBS) oxazaborolidine-mediated reduction of prochiral ketones was\ncarried out by Luisi and co-workers using a combination of flow technology\nand 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 70. The optimized conditions gave the desired asymmetric products\nin yields of up to 99% and 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), with a reaction\nduration 10 min.360 CPME, as discussed preciously in section 2, has been available\nin commercially useful\nquantities since 2005165 and has been utilized\nin a wide variety of reaction classes including organometallic mediated\ntransformations. A selection of examples highlighting some of the\nbreadth and scope of CPME employment in organometallic reactions will\nbe discussed in this section. In 2007, Okabayashi et al. developed\na facile method for the regio- and stereoselective preparation of\nketene trimethylsilyl acetals (KSAs) from t-butyl\nesters or ketoesters using strong bases such as LDA and NaHMDS, in\nconjunction with TMSCl, and CPME as solvent. The reactions were conducted\nunder mild conditions, 0–5 °C, 2.5 h and produced both\n(E)-KSAs and 1,3-bis(TMS)-KSAs, see Scheme 71.361 α-Oxygen and α -nitrogen-substituted t-butyl esters were also shown to be compatible with this methodology.\nDuring solvent screening for reaction condition optimization, it was\nshown that other ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, THF, 1,4-dioxane,\nand dimethoxyethane led to poor regioselectivity and C-silylation, whereas CPME by comparison outperformed all of these\nsolvents. CPME has also seen use as a\ncosolvent in conjunction with THF,\nsee Scheme 72. Takeda\net al. demonstrated that CPME was critical for a titanocene-mediated\nketone allylation strategy that gave access to alkyl systems containing\nadjacent stereocenters in high yield and high diastereoselectivity.362 CPME has also been used as a co-solvent (in\nconjunction with toluene) by researchers at Novartis who employed\nthe solvent as a stabilizer for a Grignard reagent during a reaction\nsequence.363 The stabilizing effect of CPME was once again\nexploited by Molander\net al. during their reaction optimization for the synthesis of azaborines.\nA 1:1 mixture of CPME:toluene was discovered to be optimum.364 Azaborines represent an important and emerging\nclass of potential isosteric replacements for traditional carbon containing\nheterocycles, and the methodology developed, Scheme 73, has allowed for facile synthesis using,\nat least in part, a more contemporary solvent. The Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is a classical\nmethod for the\nsynthesis of cyclopropanes from alkenes via insertion of a zinc carbene,\nsee Scheme 74. THF\nor diethyl ether is most often employed as solvent in this reaction\nmanifold, and in 2013, Fujii et al. conducted solvent screening to\ndetermine whether other alternative ethers could be used. It was demonstrated\nthat reactions conducted using CPME went to completion up to ten-times\nfaster than those in diethyl ether with no loss in product yield or\nselectivity. Yield improvements in some cases were also noted.365 In 2015, Pace et al. demonstrated that CPME was the optimum\nsolvent\nfor their synthesis of thioamides from the corresponding isothiocyanate\nand lithium reagent, see Scheme 75. Solvent screening showed CPME to be superior to traditional\nethers such as THF and diethyl ether and even outperformed 2-MeTHF\nin terms of yield. The methodology reported provides robust and efficient\naccess to secondary thioamides from commercially available isothiocyanates\nand includes examples where chiral isothiocyanates or organolithium\nreagents have been used to form enantiopure products with excellent\nselectivity. In 2016, a thorough investigation into the use\nof CPME in Grignard\nreactions was conducted by Kobayashi et al., see Scheme 76.345 It was shown that CPME can be used in place of THF to great effect\nand that DIBALH was the most effective method of activating the Mg\nwhen using CPME as solvent. Efficient solvent recycling of CPME was\nalso demonstrated with no loss of yield observed. Promisingly, CPME\nwas shown to be stable to Grignard reagents during long-term storage\nwith no solvent degradation observed. Furthermore, Grignard reagent\nstability in CPME was often in the order of many months; thus, CPME\ncould be used in commercial preparations of Grignard reagents.345 Ureas are used\nin agrochemicals, and in the pharmaceutical industry where they are\nfound in areas such as antibiotics, antimalarial compounds, antimicrobials,\nand many others. They have also been utilized as catalysts, ligands,\nand solvents, see Scheme 77. A greener, mild, and efficient\napproach for the synthesis of ureas,\nfrom isocyanates and secondary amines, was developed by Camp and co-workers\nusing the bioalternative solvent Cyrene, see Scheme 78.88 This method\nremoves the use of toxic solvents such as DMF, which has been used\nin the traditional synthesis of ureas. A simple workup procedure for\nthe removal of Cyrene was also established by the addition of water,\nwhich led to precipitation of the desired urea. The substrate scope\nof both the amine and isocyanate was investigated. Steglich\nesterification remains a commonly employed technique for the mild\nsynthesis of esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols or thiols.184,367 This methodology employs coupling reagents often encountered in\namide bond formation such as carbodiimides and relies heavily on either\nDCM or DMF as solvents of choice.8,367 Solvent-reagent\nselection guides for both ester and thioester synthesis have been\ndeveloped by Jordan et al. and effectively demonstrate the effective\nreplacement of dipolar aprotic solvents with safer, more sustainable\nalternatives, see Scheme 79. For the formation of thioesters from acids and thiols,\nit was found\nthat coupling reagent T3P in conjunction with solvent cyclopentanone\ngave good to excellent yields across a variety of building-block-like\nmolecules, often with rapid reaction times of just 1 h, see Scheme 79 (left). 2-MeTHF,\nEtOAc, DMC, and CPME were also shown to be viable alternatives, though\nless general in their applicability/compatibility to the substrates\nscreened.184 A solvent-reagent guide\nfor ester formation from alcohols and acids\nhas also been recently developed. In this study, a high-throughput\napproach allowed for the simultaneous identification of alternative\nsolvent DMC in conjunction with safer coupling reagent 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium\niodide (Mukaiyama’s reagent). Further optimized conditions\nwere identified from the initial screen and then successfully applied\nin the synthesis of a selection of building-block-like molecules,\nsee Scheme 79 (right).\nIn both studies, less desirable polar aprotic solvents were successfully\nreplaced with greener, safer, more sustainable alternatives. Steglich esterification in water has also been demonstrated by\nFattahi et al. using DIC as coupling reagent, though the methodology\nis limited to phenolic alcohols due to their lower pKa when compared to aliphatic alcohols in water.265 A range of peptide-based compounds are widely\nused globally, including\nclinically used hormones such as oxytocin, and peptide therapeutics.\nFrom 2015–2019, 208 new drugs were approved by the FDA, 15\nof which were peptides or peptide-containing molecules (7%).370 The increasing proportion of therapeutics falling\ninto the peptides category has been accompanied by a need for more\nsustainable methods for the solid phase synthesis of peptides (SPPS),\nsee Scheme 80. Commonly\nused solvents for SPPS fall within the reprotoxic dipolar aprotics\ncategory, being DMF, DMAc, and NMP.371 The\nchallenges in improving the sustainability in peptide synthesis and\npurification are well reviewed by Isidro-Llobet et al.372 Recently, a number of publications have aimed\nto move away from\nreprotoxic dipolar aprotic solvents in solid phase peptide synthesis,\nswitching to more sustainable alternatives. The work of Lawrenson\net al. has successfully demonstrated the use of propylene carbonate\nas a safer, more sustainable alternative to polar aprotic solvents\nsuch as DMF or NMP. In their publication, both SPPS and solution phase\nmethodology were successfully demonstrated using propylene carbonate\nas solvent with no significant impact on racemization of the amino\nacid (AA) observed. Synthesis of nonapeptide “Bradykinin”\nwas also demonstrated. NBP was identified by Novartis in 2018\nduring a systematic examination\nof 34 alternative solvents shortlisted as potential DMF replacements\nin SPPS.222 A number of parameters were\nexamined including solvent ability to swell resin, solubility of SPPS\nreagents, and reaction performance including Fmoc deprotection steps.\nNBP was successfully demonstrated as a viable drop-in replacement\nfor DMF; NBP was successfully used as the solvent during the SPPS\nsynthesis of an octapeptide with comparable yield and purity to that\nof DMF (93% yield NBP vs >99% DMF, 80% purity NBP vs 86% DMF).\nOne\nmajor point of difference was highlighted: NBP is more viscous than\nDMF (4.0 cP vs 0.8 cP) and makes for slower fluid transfer steps during\nsmaller scale SPPS operations.222 Two reports were published in 2020 in which the solvent NBP was\nused in place of traditional solvents. Kumar et al. have successfully\ndemonstrated the use of NBP as a replacement for DMF and NMP SPPS\noperations using both in situ activation and preactivation\nstrategies. Less racemization was observed for reactions conducted\nin NBP, and a reduction in the generation of side-products when forcing\nconditions were utilized was also observed. Thus, NBP has been demonstrated\nas a superior alternative to both DMF and NMP in this study.373 De la Torre et al. report the successful\nuse of NBP in an SPPS\nsequence employing problematic amino acid residue Fmoc-Arg (Pbf)–OH;\npbf = (2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl group).\nThe amino acid residue is particularly troublesome due to its propensity\nto react intramolecularly leading to δ-lactam side product.\nA systematic analysis of reaction conditions allowed for the identification\nof optimum conditions, and NBP was shown to be an excellent alternative\nsolvent to DMF, with levels of amino acid incorporation into the peptide\nbackbone approaching 100%. Purity of the crude peptides was also similar.374 From a safety perspective, it has been\nreported by Erny et al.\nthat the levels of HCN produced in DIC/Oxyma mediate amide bond forming\nreactions can be significantly reduced when a mixture of NBP:EtOAc\n1:4 is employed.375 In conjunction with\ndimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) as a HCN scrubbing additive, the authors\nsuggest that with further developments, the implementation of this\nmethodology combining greener solvents and HCN-free synthesis could\nbe applied to the industrial manufacturing of peptides. Other\nthan NBP, GVL has also been proposed as a potential alternative\nsolvent in SPPS. The group of Albericio and co-workers illustrated\nthat GVL could be utilized in polystyrene (PS)-based SPPS. GVL showed\nexcellent coupling efficiencies in both the synthesis of a pentapeptide\n(Aib-enkephalin) and decapeptide (Aib-ACP), with no major side products\nor ring opening products detected.376 A\nfollow-up to this work was published in 2019 demonstrating the effectiveness\nof GVL in Wang resin SPPS; DCM was effectively replaced as an alternative\nsolvent for the initial anchoring to the Wang resin. Subsequent elongation\nof the peptide was also successfully conducted in GVL with racemization\nand dipeptide formation found to be within acceptable levels.377 Both publications also note the compatibility\nof Fmoc residues in GVL. Most recently, Leko et al. have demonstrated\nthat a combination of EtOAc/CH3CN can be used in chlorotrityl\nchloride and 4-methylbenzhydryl bromide resin loading operations\nwith loading levels comparable to that when DCM, THF, 2-MeTHF, or\nDMF was utilized.378 In recent years,\nthere has been a significant expansion in the field of biocatalysis,\ncommonly using water as a solvent or cosolvent. However, there are\na number of problems associated with the use of water as a solvent\nin biocatalysis, even though it is readily available, is nonhazardous,\nand does not have the flammability or explosion risks associated with\norganic solvents.379 Many synthetically\nuseful reagents, those that are of interest in biocatalytic transformations,\nare poorly water-soluble, which in turn results in a requirement of\nextremely dilute reaction mixtures, leading to increased solvent use.\nThere has been a recent drive for discovery of enzymatic reactions\ncompatible with sustainable organic solvents, most notably 2-MeTHF380 and CPME.168 The most expansive class of enzymatic reaction using 2-MeTHF is that\nof hydrolases, mostly in stereoselective acylations for kinetic resolutions\nof racemates.381−383 In 2017, Secundo and co-workers reported\nthe use of 2-MeTHF in the esterification of a range of natural products\n(menthol, rac-sulcatol and rac-α-cyclogeraniol)\nusing a range of commercial lipases.384 2-MeTHF, as well as CPME, performed well compared to traditional\nsolvents such as toluene and MTBE, with high enantioselectivity. A\nsimilar enzymatic acylation of racemic benzoin in 2-MeTHF, reported\nby Alcántara and colleagues in 2011, using Pseudomonas\nstutzeri lipase (PSL) and Shvo’s catalyst, led to\nkinetic resolution over 48 h, in a 85% yield and 99% e.e. (Scheme 81).385 Numerous additional examples are also found\nwithin the literature using 2-MeTHF as an alternative bio-based solvent,\ntargeting selective acylations of glycosides.386−390 Away from kinetic resolutions, Pseudomonas stutzeri lipase (PSL) has additionally be used as an effective catalyst in\namination reactions of esters, reported by Wong et al. in 2011.391 Shown to form a wide range of alkyl and aryl\namides, 2-MeTHF was reportedly selected due to a high solubilizing\nability of the organic starting materials, with MTBE also shown to\nperform effectively in the transformation. A selection of papers\nusing 2-MeTHF as a bio-based solvent, for\naccessing chiral α-hydroxyketones through either carboligation392,393 or domino enzymatic reactions,394 have\nalso been reported. The first of which, by Domínquez de María\nin 2010, involved use of 2-MeTHF as a (co)solvent alternative to DMSO\nor MTBE for enantioselective C–C bond formation between aldehydes.\nCatalyzed by a thiamine diphosphate-dependent lyase (ThDP-Lyase),\nan efficient enantioselective carboligation of aldehydes to furnish\nchiral α-hydroxyketones was described, providing products in\n>90% yield and generally >95% e.e. (Scheme 82a). A similar report by Rother and co-workers\nin 2012 also used ThDP-Lyase for the umpolung carboligation\nof acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde, examining the relative product distribution\nof the eight possible enantiomeric products.393 (a) Carboligation of aldehydes\nto produce chiral α-hydroxyketones. (b) Domino enzymatic process\nfor the preparation of 2-HPP, with in situ generation\nof acetaldehyde via kinetic resolution. This\nwas further followed up in 2012 by a domino enzymatic cascade\nusing an aldehyde and butyrate or laurate substrate, in the presence\nof Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) and benzaldehyde\nlyase (BAL).394 An initial conversion of\nthe vinyl ester into acetaldehyde, followed by a subsequent C–C\nbond formation with benzaldehyde, catalyzed by BAL, furnished (R)-2-hydroxypropriophenone (2-HPP) in quantitative\nconversion and >99% e.e. (Scheme 82b). Although the majority of biocatalytic transformations\ncarried out\nin organic solvents such as 2-MeTHF fall under the hydrolases class\ndue to their high robustness, a small number of other enzymes are\nalso compatible. In 2014, metagenome screening by Kurokawa and colleagues\nidentified a dehydrogenase enzyme, homologous Leifsoniaadh alcohol\ndehydrogenase (HLADH), which was able to effectively reduce a selection\nof ketones, with high tolerance to 2-MeTHF, in excellent (generally\n>99%) enantiomeric excess.395 Similar\nketone\nreductions have been reported, for example, using YOL151W reductase396 and KREDs (Scheme 83).397 Other than 2-MeTHF, a solvent\n(or cosolvent) that has demonstrated\npotential within biocatalytic transformations is cyclopentyl methyl\nether (CPME). CPME, similar to 2-MeTHF, has proven effective in kinetic\nresolution, such as the one reported by González-Sabín\nand co-workers in 2017.398 As part of a\nkey step in the synthesis of Ivabradine, a drug used for the treatment\nof stable angina pectoris, alkoxycarbonylation kinetic resolution\nof an amine precursor was carried out using the lipase PSC-II and\ndiethylcarbonate, yielding the desired (S)-enantiomer\nin 30% yield, 92% e.e. (Scheme 84). The utility of CPME as a solvent in the reduction of imine-type\nfunctionalities, using IREDs (imine reductases), was reported by Rother\nand Maugeri in 2016.399 Reduction of cyclic\nC=N functionalities using whole cells containing Streptomyces\naurantiacus and Paenibacillus elgii B69\ngave an e.r. of >99:1 under micro aqueous reaction conditions (Scheme 85)."

      "title": "Suzuki-Miyaura\nCross-Coupling",
      "text": "Palladium\ncatalysis is used extensively in both industrial and academic synthetic\nchemistry laboratories as a powerful methodology for the formation\nof C–C bonds. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of organoboronic\nacids and their derivatives is the most frequently utilized palladium-catalyzed\nC–C bond forming reactions in the chemical industry, see Scheme 15.14 Traditionally, ethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and\nTHF or dipolar aprotics such as DMF are employed for a large proportion\nof these reactions.14 Owing to the frequent\nuse and importance of this reaction, there is great potential for\n“greener” solvent alternatives to have a significant\nimpact. Note that discussion surrounding the use of Suzuki-Miyaura\nreactions as a benchmark for the performance of new solvents suggests\nthat it is not the most informative reaction manifold.270 For example, cross-coupling can be successfully\nconducted in rapeseed oil and butter with both of these lipid-based\nsystems outperforming benchmark solvent DMF.271 Watson and co-workers developed a mild method\nfor the Suzuki-Miyaura\nreaction that employed Cyrene as a greener alternative to the commonly\nused dipolar aprotic solvents (Scheme 16).14 The reaction\nscope was extensively explored by varying both the organoboron nucleophile\nand aryl electrophile. The conditions developed demonstrated excellent\ngenerality and functional group tolerance. The group reported 57 examples\nwith yields ranging from 44 to 100%, from discovery to gram-scale\nreactions. Hunt et al. have explored the use of NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent\nfor Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 17.110 Yields for\na series of reactions performed in both NMP and NBP have been reported,\nto carry out a comparison, using a range of different substituted\naryl halides to explore the scope. Although the results showed that\nreactions using NMP as solvent gave better yields overall (76–90%\nfor model reactions utilizing 4-iodoacetophenone and a range\nof phenylboronic acids), reactions carried out in NBP still gave good\nyields (∼10% lower for the same model reaction), as seen in Table 5. However, the reactions\nhad not been optimized to specifically favor N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\nso there may also be potential to improve the performance of these\nreactions. Dimethyl isosorbide has been\ndemonstrated as an effective reaction\nmedium for several classical cross-coupling reactions. In 2018, Watson\net al. reported the use of DMI in several Suzuki-Miyaura reactions\n(12 substrates). In general, aromatics with various electron donating\nand withdrawing groups were tolerated as were variations in the electrophilic\ncomponent including vinyl groups, boronic acids, and pinacol esters.214 Reaction times were 1 h conducted at 60 °C\nwith 4 mol % Pd(dppf)Cl2, and yields ranged from 62 to\n>99%. Garg and co-workers have reported the nickel-catalyzed\nSuzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling between aryl halides and (hetero)aromatic boronic\nacids in a number of greener solvent alternatives.272 Initial solvent screening showed that EtOAc, iPrOH, 2-MeTHF,\nand t-amyl alcohol were all demonstrated to be excellent\nalternatives, see Scheme 18, to traditionally employed solvents such as toluene or 1,4-dioxane.\nThe reaction scope was further explored using 2-MeTHF and t-amyl alcohol as solvents. The scope was found to be broad\npertaining to both coupling partners, with heterocycles well tolerated\n(Scheme 18). The methodology\nwas demonstrated on multigram scales using low catalyst loadings (0.5–1.0\nmol % nickel) to provide desired products in reasonable to excellent\nyields. 2-MeTHF has also been successfully employed as reaction solvent\nin palladium–NHC-catalyzed amide and ester cleaving cross-coupling\nreactions.273 Following the emergence of eucalyptol as a sustainable,\nbioderived\nsolvent, the utility of it in cross-coupling reactions has been explored\nin a number of transformations by Berteina-Raboin and colleagues.205−207 When tested in palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling\nreactions of arylboronic acids with heteroaryl chlorides, eucalyptol\noutperformed reactions conducted in THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, with\nyields ranging from 44 to 99%. Reaction temperatures of 100 °C\nwere required for complete dissolution of reagents."

In 2020, Manikandan and co-workers\nopted for the use of 2-MeTHF\nin the synthesis of a triazolo-pyridazine-6-yl-substituted via a Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-coupling.283 The 2-MeTHF was used\nas the solvent in the final stage of the synthesis for 12 medicinally\nrelevant antidiabetic compounds, and yields were reported in the range\nof 92–98% using a catalytic combination of 10 mol % Pd2(dba)3/XPhos, in the presence of NaOtBu at room temperature for 4 h, see Scheme 27.

A recent publication by Frantz and co-workers\ndescribes a sustainable method for accessing arylboronic acids from\npseudohalides and B2(OH)4 using a 0.01 mol %\npalladium catalyst loading in a 1:1 mixture of 2-MeTHF and MeOH, see Scheme 32.296 Also described is a direct one-pot conversion of aryl halide\nto the boronic acid diethanolamine (DEA) adduct, providing synthesis\nof boronate species less susceptible to protodeboronation.297 This transformation is well-tolerated for aryl\nand (hetero)aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides, with yields ranging\nfrom 60–85%, on the choice of catalyst, (AtaPhos)2PdCl2 or XPhos-Pd-G3. The effectiveness of the methodology\nis demonstrated by a one-pot tandem borylation-Suzuki sequence, furnishing\na diverse range of C–C coupled products with no more than 2\nmol % palladium used for the overall two-step process. Many more examples\nof greener palladium-catalyzed borylations of aryl halides using B2(OH)4 or B2pin2 are known\nin 2-MeTHF298 and CPME.299 Although not as widely used as aryl and hetero(aryl)boronic\nacids and boronates, alkenyl boronates have important applications\nin Diels–Alder cycloadditions, as precursors to cyclopropyl\nboronates, and as effective radical acceptors.300 Recently, a number of publications have highlighted the\nuse of sustainable solvents in borylation reactions of alkynes, both\nrhodium301 and copper-catalyzed.302 A publication by Hutzler and co-workers in\n2017, outlining routes to the synthesis of herbicides, included a\nrhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with HBpin, with a solvent\nchoice of cyclohexanone.301 The reaction,\ncarried out below room temperature (18 °C), yielded the desired Z-alkene in 52% yield after 2 h (Scheme 33). Similarly, a publication by Woźniak and co-workers in 2019,\nshowcasing the utility of copper-NHC complexes containing sulfone\nand sulfoxide side-chains, describes a low catalyst loading (0.05\nmol %) hydroboration of alkynes, using CPME as the solvent, with a\nMeOH additive (10:1), see Scheme 34.302 In this instance, CPME\noutperforms both isopropanol and toluene, and the catalytic system\napplies to both alkynes (yielding alkenyl boronates) and alkenes (yielding\nalkyl boronates). Yields for all substrates studied are in excess\nof 95%, proving the methodology a very powerful and sustainable way\nto hydroborate alkynes and alkenes. In addition to solvent swaps to\nCPME, 2-MeTHF, and cyclohexanone, MTBE has also been shown to be highly\neffective in borylation sequences. Reported in 2009, Marder and co-workers\nutilized the solvent in a one-pot C–H borylation/Suzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling sequence, a transformation shown to be highly effective\nfor both aryl and heteroaryl substrates.174 Borylation in protic solvents such as MeOH303 and EtOH304 has also been reported including\nin the 2020 report on transition metal-free borylation of aryl halides\nusing bis-boronic acid in MeOH.305"

In many examples of chemistry involving C–H activation,\ngreen solvents have been too easily overlooked in preference to solvents\nsuch as THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, which have been frequently used.306 The inclusion of safer solvents such as 2-MeTHF\n(and exploring less conventional PEG or aqueous-micellar systems)\nduring reaction optimization and solvent screening is therefore critical\nif the field of C–H activation is to migrate away from solvents\nof concern. Reviews on the subject of emerging unconventional organic\nsolvents for C–H bond activation have been published in 2019\nby Gandeepan et al.,307 in 2020 by Yu et\nal.,308 and in 2021 by Dhawa et al.309 and Dalton et al.306 We direct the reader toward these bodies of work for further information\nand specific examples. The 2-MeTHF was used as a replacement to THF and 1,4-dioxane by\nAckerman and co-workers in a mild C–H activation of allenes\nusing a Fe(0) phosphine catalyst (Scheme 36).310 Across\na selection of aryl substrates containing an α-ketone directing\ngroup, efficient C–H functionalization using Fe(PMe3)4 yielded a diverse range of products in good to excellent\nyields. Also demonstrated was a tolerability of hydroxyl, amino, and\nalkoxycarbonyl moieties, in addition to mechanistic and computational\ninvestigations. The bioderived solvent eucalyptol has also been shown to have utility\nas a solvent for direct C–H arylations by Berteina-Raboin and\ncolleagues.277 Following synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines from the corresponding 2-aminopyridine\nand 2-bromoacetophenone derivatives, Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed\ndirect C–H arylation at the C-3 position using bromobenzene\nin eucalyptol yielded the desired arylated product in 60% (5 mol %\ncat.) and 61% yields (10 mol % cat.) after 24 h at 150 °C, see Scheme 37.

Across\n8 substrates, excellent yields (79–91%) of the cyclized product\nwere obtained, with solvent recovery and reuse, without further purification,\nalso demonstrated.311 Kakiuchi and co-workers developed a Ru-catalyzed stereoselective\nC–H arylation of ortho-methoxylated acetophenones and C–H\nmonoarylation of ortho-unsubstituted acetophenones in high yields\nusing cyclohexanone as solvent, see Scheme 39. Note: styrene was utilized as a necessary\nadditive to selectively provide monoarylation.312,313 Aqueous surfactant systems such as TPGS750M-H2O have\nalso been successfully utilized in ruthenium-catalyzed C–H\narylation reactions.314 PEG-based systems have been demonstrated as promising alternatives\nto conventional solvents as evidenced by Ackermann et al., who first\nshowed in 2009 that PEG-20000 could be used as solvent for either\nRu- or Pd-catalyzed direct arylation chemistry.315 This discovery has led to other PEG-derived systems such\nas that demonstrated by Reddy et al.316 who showed that PEG-400 was an excellent solvent for Cu-mediated\ncross-coupling of oxadiazoles with dibromoalkenes, see Scheme 40.

Traditional methods for the\npreparation of such species include hydroformylations of alkenes and\namide couplings, to name a few, which often require toxic heavy metals,321 pyrophoric organometallic reagents,322 or allergenic amide coupling reagents.323 In recent years there has been a shift toward\ncatalytic methodologies including palladium-catalyzed formylations\nand carbonylations of aryl halides using carbon monoxide gas or surrogates\nthereof.324 Unfortunately, use of the gas\nis often accompanied by the use of dipolar aprotic solvents such as\nDMF,325 see Schemes 44 and 45, or 1,4-dioxane,326 see Scheme 46, to aid the solubility of the gas in the reaction\nmedium.327 Recently, there has been interest in substituting reprotoxic dipolar\naprotic solvents with more sustainable alternatives for carbonylation\nreactions. One of the alternative solvents for such transformations\nhas been the cellulose-derived solvent GVL. In 2016, initial exploratory\nwork into the use of biomass-derived solvents by Mika and colleagues\nrevealed the utility of GVL in the aminocarbonylation of aryl\nhalides under CO(g), see Scheme 47.328 In a system catalyzed\nby Pd(OAc)2/PPh3, it was shown that a mixture\nof the carboxamide and ketocarboxamide products could be obtained,\nand relative ratio of the ketocarboxamide could be favored by\nincreasing of CO(g) pressure, see Table 7.328 Following\non from this initial work, the group later published\na palladium-catalyzed carbonylative esterification of aryl iodides\nwith a wide range of alcohols in 2020.329 Again using GVL, the transformation provided a wide range of ester\nproducts with significantly improved yields compared to the previous\naminocarbonylation,328 ranging from\n39 to 99% with phenol coupling partners and 13–99% with alkyl\nalcohol coupling partners, see Scheme 48.329 In 2019, Schwab and co-workers\nreported a simple and efficient\naminocarbonylation process to access 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides\nfrom the related heteroaryl iodide species.330 The Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed process involved in situ generation of CO(g) using a combination of H2SO4 and HCO2H within CO-ware equipment.\nUtilizing the sustainable solvent dimethyl carbonate, a variety of\nfunctionalized 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides were produced, with yields\nranging from 33 to 98% (Scheme 49).330 In the area of carboxylation reactions, in 2015, Levacher\nand co-workers\nreported a sustainable carboxylation of organic (heteroaryl, alkenyl,\nand allyl) halides in 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 50.331 Using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl formate as a CO2(g)\nsurrogate, and in the process eliminating the requirement for a high\nCO2-solubilizing dipolar aprotic solvent and opting for\nthe use of 2-MeTHF, a wide range of N-hydroxysuccinimide\nesters were accessible (Scheme 50). The methodology was shown to be effective in the\ncarboxylation of a functionalized quinoline intermediate in the preparation\nof a number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, with\nthe transformation progressing in 82% isolated yield.331 Metal-catalyzed hydroamination of styrenes has recently been reported\nby Mulks et al., see Scheme 51. In their work, the conventional wisdom of air- and moisture-free\norganometallic reactions is challenged by their demonstration of hydroamination\nof aryl alkenes in 2-MeTHF using lithium amides, see Table 8. Reactions were open to air\nand moisture and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Yields were\nmoderate to excellent with some incompatibility observed when using\nstyrenes containing aryl halide moieties.332 Remarkably, the presence of adventitious moisture was shown to be\nbeneficial and not detrimental. Reactions were accelerated by moisture,\nwhich generated free amine in situ at a steady rate.332 Sodium amides were also shown to be compatible\nwith the methodology. In 2020, a publication by Gevorgyan et al.\ninvestigated the utility\nof newly discovered biomass-sourced solvents in carboxylation reactions.208 In an overall transformation for the hydrocarboxylation\nof alkenes, via a boronate species from an initial hydroboration with\n9-BBN, sustainable solvents including eucalyptol, dimethyl isosorbide\n(DMI), and GVL were screened, see Scheme 52. Given that the process occurs via a boronate\nspecies, the effectiveness of the secondary carboxylation of boronic\nacid pinacol esters, Bpins, was also explored. For the overall hydrocarboxylation\nof 4-methylstyrene, 2-MeTHF, eucalyptol, DMI, and GVL were all found\nto outperform dipolar aprotics of concern including THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nsee Table 9. The hydroboration\nmethodology was not restricted to just benzylic alkenes, that is,\nstyrenes.208 For the conversion of phenyl Bpin to the corresponding phenyl carboxylic\nacid, of the general type depicted in Scheme 53, DMI was found to outperform THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nwith 2-MeTHF and (+)-rose oxide also notably performing above 70%\nyield (Table 10).\nIn addition to these two reactions, the solvents were comparatively\nscreened for numerous other carboxylation processes including transition\nmetal-catalyzed carboxylations (copper, zirconium, iron, and nickel).208 The Cu-catalyzed carboyxylation methodology\nwas further applied toward the synthesis of active pharmaceutical\ningredients Fenoprofen (60% yield) and Flurbiprofen (53% yield). Pd-catalyzed alkoxy- and amino-carbonylation and aryl bromide/boronic\nacid carbonylation in greener more sustainable solvents has been recently\ndemonstrated by Ismael et al.333 Sixteen\npotentially safer, more sustainable solvents were included during\nsolvent screening investigations including dipolar aprotic alternatives\nsuch as DMI, GVL, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, and\nether 2-MeTHF. It was found that aminocarbonylation proceeded\nwell in DMC while alkoxycarbonylation was successfully conducted\nin DMC and 2-MeTHF.333 Lastly, a\nvery recent report by Elorriaga and colleagues disclosed\na hybrid synthetic method in which an aluminum-catalyzed fixation\nof carbon dioxide in 2-MeTHF led to conversion of epoxides into tertiary\nalcohols.334 This process, catalyzed by\nAlEt2(κ2-bpzbdeape) (bpzbdeape = 1,1-bis(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethan-1-ol),\nresults in insertion of CO2 into one of the epoxide C–O\nbonds and subsequent ring expansion to form 5-membered cyclic carbonates\nin a near-quantitative yield. These cyclic carbonates, derived from\nthe structure of the starting epoxide, are then treated with 5 equiv\nof an alkyllithium reagent (e.g., EtLi), resulting in rapid conversion\nto the trialkyl alcohol.

In 2019, Szekely and co-workers discussed\nthe use of novel solvent PolarClean alongside other greener alternatives\n(GVL, Cyrene, and propylene carbonate) in a selection of reaction\nclasses including SNAr reactions.104 Using model reactions for the substitution of phenol or benzimidazole\non substrate bis(4-fluorophenyl) sulfone, comparisons between the\nsustainable solvents and more traditional alternatives of concern\n(DMAc, toluene) were explored, see Scheme 56. Using phenol, the more favorable alternatives\nperformed effectively compared to DMAc/toluene (86–92% compared\nto 70%) though were slightly less effective using benzimidazole (77–87%\ncompared to 97%), see Table 11. Studying the use of Cyrene-derived solvents such as\nthose falling\ninto the Cygnet class, Clark and colleagues at the University of York\nexplored the substitution of these solvents in nucleophilic aromatic\nfluorination reactions of pyridines.66 In\nthe study, which also involved use in other reaction classes, kinetic\ninvestigations in the fluorination of 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine using\na Cygnet 0.0 and a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents were carried\nout. Cygnet 0.0 resulted in higher reaction rates that MeCN and NMP,\nwith comparable rates to DMF.66 A small\nselection of publications in the previous 5 years have opted for a\nstraight solvent swap of the disfavored THF for the more sustainable\nalternative 2-MeTHF, mostly focusing on SNAr reactions\nfor medicinal chemistry applications. While investigating Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-couplings, Buchwald and Smith discovered that in a small number\nof cases when coupling secondary amines with the model substrate,\nthe reaction in 2-MeTHF proceeded effectively under noncatalyzed conditions.338 In the design of a greener synthetic route\nto an EGFR receptor inhibitor, McWilliams and co-workers from Pfizer\nsubstituted THF for 2-MeTHF in a key SNAr step, yielding\nthe desired product in 90% yield, see Scheme 57.339 A report by Parmentier et al.\nin 2016 demonstrated the utility\nof surfactant-based amphiphiles in the synthesis of a pharmaceutically\nrelevant API.340 Looking to enhance the\nfirst generation route for synthesis, the group explored the use of\nTPGS-750-M in water over the 5-step synthesis, with the primary step\ninvolving an SNAr reaction of an amine fragment and an\n(hetero)aryl electrophile (structures likely withdrawn from the publication\ndue to intellectual property restraints). For this SNAr\nstep, a switch from organic solvents to a surfactant–water\nsystem resulted in a slightly diminished yield of 75% compared to\n87%, but for the overall 5-step route, the process mass intensity\n(PMI) of the process was decreased by 32%.340 More recently, Berteina-Raboin and co-workers explored the\nuse\nof the widely available PEG-400 (polyethylene glycol) as a solvent\nin nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, see Scheme 58.341 The reaction was shown to perform effectively, using a range of\naliphatic and aromatic amines, on medicinally relevant substrate classes\nincluding imidazo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazines. For the wide ranging substrate scope, yields are\nreported in the range of 70–99%.341 Various PEG variants have also been successfully applied in many\nmetal-mediated reactions including oxidation, reduction, cross-coupling,\nand polymerization. This subject has been well reviewed by Colacino\net al.342 Often, organic solvents\ncan be replaced entirely from SNAr type chemistry. In 2013,\nWalsh et al. demonstrated that several\nSNAr reactions comprising heteroaryl chlorides such as\npyrimidine, pyrazine, and quinazoline could be conducted in water\nin the presence of KF. Surprisingly, several transformations that\nwere previously reported in the literature as requiring transition\nmetal catalysis were able to be conducted free from Pd.343"

      "text": "Organometallic-based\nreactions, such as those involving the use of alkyl lithium reagents,\nGrignard reagents, and metal hydride reductions, are commonly carried\nout in ethereal solvents and hydrocarbons due to the need for stability\nunder basic conditions.204,344 The most commonly\nused solvents within this class include diethyl ether, THF, and 1,4-dioxane,\nall of which are solvents of concern, see Figure 31.8 In recent\nyears, as a solution to the ongoing issues surrounding these solvents,\n2-MeTHF158,160 and CPME345 have\nboth been proposed as sustainable alternative solvents in a range\nof organometallic reactions, key examples of which will be discussed\nin this section. A number of commonly employed organometallic reagents\nare also now available as commercial preparations in alternative solvents\nsuch as 2-MeTHF.346 Organometallic reagents\nand their commonly employed ethereal solvents. 2-MeTHF\nhas been successfully utilized in a multitude of organometallic\nreactions, often acting as a “drop in” replacement for\nTHF or 1,4-dioxane. In 2010, Carbone et al. demonstrated that 2-MeTHF\ncould be used as solvent in asymmetric deprotonation reactions where\na chiral amine anion base is prepared in situ. Remarkably,\nthe chiral nature of the amine base is critical for enantioselectivity\nin asymmetric lithiation reactions when THF or 2-MeTHF are used as\nsolvent; anion bases derived from (−)-sparteine proceeded with\nlow enantioselectivity, whereas when a (+)-sparteine surrogate was\nemployed, excellent selectivity was observed.347 When MTBE was employed as solvent, excellent enantioselectivity\nwas observed for both sparteine bases, see Table 12 and Scheme 59. The selectivity is explained by the authors\nthrough a series of experiments investigating the solution phase dimerization\nand organization of the lithium base solvent complexes. The (+)-sparteine\nsurrogate used is (+)-(1R,2S,9S)-11-methyl-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7tridecane]. Mild, chemoselective N-TBS\nprotection of anilines\nhas been reported by Pace et al. using 2-MeTHF as a direct replacement\nfor THF. Under their optimized reaction conditions, TBS protection\nof aniline was conducted at 0 °C in just 30 min using MeLi and\nTBDMSCl in excellent yields (88–98%, 15 examples). Excellent\nchemoselectivity was also observed when iodo and bromo anilines were\nutilized as substrates; no lithium-halogen exchange was observed when\nusing 2-MeTHF as solvent but exchange did occur when using diethyl\nether. Finally, site selective TBS protection of aniline nitrogen\nover alkylamino nitrogen atoms was demonstrated, see Scheme 60. When using THF or diethyl\nether, a 1:1 mixture was observed. This remarkable selectivity has\nbeen proposed by the authors as being due to a reduction in the amount\nof highly polar amine dianion formed in 2-MeTHF due to the solvent’s\npolarity.348 Additionally, the authors\nundertook an examination of deprotection conditions showing that it\nwas possible to deprotect the TBS protected anilines in near quantitative\nyield in 2 h by simply stirring the compounds in a suspension of silica\ngel in an ethanol:water mixture (1:5). Note: −50 °C\nused here instead of 0 °C. The utility\nof 2-MeTHF in LiBr mediated selective 1,2-additions\nof organolithium reagents to α,β-unsaturated imines, ketones,\nand aldehydes to give a variety of allylic alcohols and amines has\nbeen demonstrated.349 Notably, no 1,4-addition\nproducts were detected by 1H NMR, and the reactions were\nconducted at 0 °C making this an attractively simple method.\nAnalogous reactions conducted in THF took longer and gave poorer yields\nwhen compared to 2-MeTHF (e.g., 6 h 79% yield vs 2 h quantitative\nyield for the 1,2 addition of MeLi to cyclohexenone), see Scheme 61. Other lithium base mediated reactions that have been successfully\nconducted in 2-MeTHF include preparations of γ-hydroxy-α,β-acetylenic\nesters using the base lithium tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP).350 Once more, Pace et al. have demonstrated the\nsuperior utility of 2-MeTHF through their exhaustive screening of\nhydrocarbon and ethereal solvents in the reaction of methyl-2-bromoacrylate\nwith benzaldehyde in the presence of a strong alkyllithium base, see Scheme 62. The 2-MeTHF gave\na 94% yield of the desired alcohol in just 1.5 h at −40 °C\ncompared to THF, which gave just 67% under the same conditions. Efficient access decorated four- and six-membered sulfur containing\nheterocycles (i.e., thietanes and thiopyrans) have also been achieved\nthrough a lithiation electrophile trapping strategy using 2-MeTHF\nas solvent, see Scheme 63. The 2-MeTHF was shown to improve regioselectivity considerably\nover THF.351 A wide range of benzylic and\naliphatic electrophiles were utilized, and varying degrees of electrophile\ndependent stereocontrol were observed. Other areas of organometallic chemistry in which 2-MeTHF has seen\nutility include zirconium chemistry such as that employing Schwartz’s\nreagent ((C5H5)2ZrHCl). Schwartz’s\nreagent in the presence of 2-MeTHF has been used to reduce isocyanates\nto formamides under mild conditions with excellent chemoselectivity\nand stereoretention of chiral substrates observed (room temperature,\n1 h), see Scheme 65.352 THF gave\nslightly poorer yields of about −5% during solvent screening\nreaction development. Similarly, Schwartz’s reagent can be\nutilized to reduce isothiocyanates to thioformamides.351 Electron withdrawing groups attached to the\naromatic isocyanates were also well tolerated including reactive functional\ngroups such as azo and azide motifs.353 The use of 2-MeTHF and the use of an in situ generated\nSchwartz reagent as the hydride source were crucial for obtaining\nhigh chemocontrol.354 Schwartz’s reagent\nis prepared in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and LiAl(O-t-Bu)3H, that is, Snieckus protocol. Subtle differences in the solubilizing and stabilizing\neffect of\n2-MeTHF have been effectively leveraged by Lelo et al., who have successfully\nemployed this solvent to promote α-elimination of lithium halide\nsalts to carbenoids, that is, Kirmse’s α-elimination.\nTaking advantage of the unique properties of 2-MeTHF, LiX salts have\nbeen degraded to carbenoids and reacted in situ with\nepoxides to give β-halohydrins. Employing THF or diethyl ether\nunder the same conditions helps to stabilize the lithium salts, and\nthe transformations were poorly accommodated by these more stabilizing\nsolvents.355 Other uses of ICH2X include the NaBH4-mediated reduction of diselenides\nin the presence of ICH2F to give α-fluoromethyl selenoethers.356 Synthesis of secondary amides from phenyl\nthiocarbamates and commercially\navailable Grignard reagents has been demonstrated by Mampuys et al.\nutilizing 2-MeTHF as solvent, see Scheme 66.357 Good to\nexcellent yields were observed across a wide variety of substrates\nincluding sterically hindered and electron-deficient compounds (Scheme 67). The Grignard reaction manifold\nrepresents a classical and key methodology\nfor C–C bond formation. Grignard reactions, at their simplest,\ninvolve the addition of an organomagnesium halide to a carbonyl\ncontaining molecule, forming a new C–C bond and an alcohol.\nThe reaction was discovered in 1900 by Victor Grignard, for which\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912.358 The reaction today is still widely employed and has even\nbeen conducted in the large scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and their intermediates.177 Grignard reactions have classically employed solvents of concern\nsuch as THF or diethyl ether, thus prompting the research group of\nZhang et al. to undertake a systematic study evaluating the performance\nof a variety of alternative and more sustainable solvents in Grignard-type\nreactions.177 It was demonstrated that\n2-MeTHF performed just as well or out-performed diethyl ether or THF\nin a wide variety of Grignard reactions including benzyl, aryl, and\nheteroaromatic Grignard reagents. CPME was also shown to be an appropriate\nsolvent when DIBAL-H instead of I2 was used as an initiator.\nA solvent comparison study for the formation of API tramadol was also\nconducted, see Scheme 64, with 2-MeTHF outperforming THF by +11% yield. After a performance\nevaluation and screening of solvents for a range of Grignard reactions,\nZhang et al. now recommend the use of 2-MeTHF as alternative solvent\nto Et2O and THF for the preparation of most Grignard reagents\nand their subsequent reactions, see Scheme 68. They noted that the use of 2-MeTHF was\nequal if not superior in suppressing the Wurtz coupling byproduct\nfrom benzyl Grignard reactions, see Table 13.177 The use of Reformatsky reagents in the large-scale synthesis of\nvarious enantiopure N-tert-butanesulfinyl trifluoromethyl\nβ-amino esters from bench-stable analogues of aliphatic and\naromatic trifluoromethyl N-tert-butanesulfinyl ketoimines\nwas reported by Grellepois, see Scheme 69. During optimization studies, it was found\nthat 2-MeTHF was the best solvent.359 The synthesis of enantioenriched\nalcohols via the Corey-Baskshi-Shibata\n(CBS) oxazaborolidine-mediated reduction of prochiral ketones was\ncarried out by Luisi and co-workers using a combination of flow technology\nand 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 70. The optimized conditions gave the desired asymmetric products\nin yields of up to 99% and 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), with a reaction\nduration 10 min.360 CPME, as discussed preciously in section 2, has been available\nin commercially useful\nquantities since 2005165 and has been utilized\nin a wide variety of reaction classes including organometallic mediated\ntransformations. A selection of examples highlighting some of the\nbreadth and scope of CPME employment in organometallic reactions will\nbe discussed in this section. In 2007, Okabayashi et al. developed\na facile method for the regio- and stereoselective preparation of\nketene trimethylsilyl acetals (KSAs) from t-butyl\nesters or ketoesters using strong bases such as LDA and NaHMDS, in\nconjunction with TMSCl, and CPME as solvent. The reactions were conducted\nunder mild conditions, 0–5 °C, 2.5 h and produced both\n(E)-KSAs and 1,3-bis(TMS)-KSAs, see Scheme 71.361 α-Oxygen and α -nitrogen-substituted t-butyl esters were also shown to be compatible with this methodology.\nDuring solvent screening for reaction condition optimization, it was\nshown that other ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, THF, 1,4-dioxane,\nand dimethoxyethane led to poor regioselectivity and C-silylation, whereas CPME by comparison outperformed all of these\nsolvents. CPME has also seen use as a\ncosolvent in conjunction with THF,\nsee Scheme 72. Takeda\net al. demonstrated that CPME was critical for a titanocene-mediated\nketone allylation strategy that gave access to alkyl systems containing\nadjacent stereocenters in high yield and high diastereoselectivity.362 CPME has also been used as a co-solvent (in\nconjunction with toluene) by researchers at Novartis who employed\nthe solvent as a stabilizer for a Grignard reagent during a reaction\nsequence.363 The stabilizing effect of CPME was once again\nexploited by Molander\net al. during their reaction optimization for the synthesis of azaborines.\nA 1:1 mixture of CPME:toluene was discovered to be optimum.364 Azaborines represent an important and emerging\nclass of potential isosteric replacements for traditional carbon containing\nheterocycles, and the methodology developed, Scheme 73, has allowed for facile synthesis using,\nat least in part, a more contemporary solvent. The Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is a classical\nmethod for the\nsynthesis of cyclopropanes from alkenes via insertion of a zinc carbene,\nsee Scheme 74. THF\nor diethyl ether is most often employed as solvent in this reaction\nmanifold, and in 2013, Fujii et al. conducted solvent screening to\ndetermine whether other alternative ethers could be used. It was demonstrated\nthat reactions conducted using CPME went to completion up to ten-times\nfaster than those in diethyl ether with no loss in product yield or\nselectivity. Yield improvements in some cases were also noted.365 In 2015, Pace et al. demonstrated that CPME was the optimum\nsolvent\nfor their synthesis of thioamides from the corresponding isothiocyanate\nand lithium reagent, see Scheme 75. Solvent screening showed CPME to be superior to traditional\nethers such as THF and diethyl ether and even outperformed 2-MeTHF\nin terms of yield. The methodology reported provides robust and efficient\naccess to secondary thioamides from commercially available isothiocyanates\nand includes examples where chiral isothiocyanates or organolithium\nreagents have been used to form enantiopure products with excellent\nselectivity. In 2016, a thorough investigation into the use\nof CPME in Grignard\nreactions was conducted by Kobayashi et al., see Scheme 76.345 It was shown that CPME can be used in place of THF to great effect\nand that DIBALH was the most effective method of activating the Mg\nwhen using CPME as solvent. Efficient solvent recycling of CPME was\nalso demonstrated with no loss of yield observed. Promisingly, CPME\nwas shown to be stable to Grignard reagents during long-term storage\nwith no solvent degradation observed. Furthermore, Grignard reagent\nstability in CPME was often in the order of many months; thus, CPME\ncould be used in commercial preparations of Grignard reagents.345"

Furthermore, Grignard reagent\nstability in CPME was often in the order of many months; thus, CPME\ncould be used in commercial preparations of Grignard reagents.345"

      "title": "Solid Phase Peptide\nSynthesis (SPPS)",
      "text": "A range of peptide-based compounds are widely\nused globally, including\nclinically used hormones such as oxytocin, and peptide therapeutics.\nFrom 2015–2019, 208 new drugs were approved by the FDA, 15\nof which were peptides or peptide-containing molecules (7%).370 The increasing proportion of therapeutics falling\ninto the peptides category has been accompanied by a need for more\nsustainable methods for the solid phase synthesis of peptides (SPPS),\nsee Scheme 80. Commonly\nused solvents for SPPS fall within the reprotoxic dipolar aprotics\ncategory, being DMF, DMAc, and NMP.371 The\nchallenges in improving the sustainability in peptide synthesis and\npurification are well reviewed by Isidro-Llobet et al.372 Recently, a number of publications have aimed\nto move away from\nreprotoxic dipolar aprotic solvents in solid phase peptide synthesis,\nswitching to more sustainable alternatives. The work of Lawrenson\net al. has successfully demonstrated the use of propylene carbonate\nas a safer, more sustainable alternative to polar aprotic solvents\nsuch as DMF or NMP. In their publication, both SPPS and solution phase\nmethodology were successfully demonstrated using propylene carbonate\nas solvent with no significant impact on racemization of the amino\nacid (AA) observed. Synthesis of nonapeptide “Bradykinin”\nwas also demonstrated. NBP was identified by Novartis in 2018\nduring a systematic examination\nof 34 alternative solvents shortlisted as potential DMF replacements\nin SPPS.222 A number of parameters were\nexamined including solvent ability to swell resin, solubility of SPPS\nreagents, and reaction performance including Fmoc deprotection steps.\nNBP was successfully demonstrated as a viable drop-in replacement\nfor DMF; NBP was successfully used as the solvent during the SPPS\nsynthesis of an octapeptide with comparable yield and purity to that\nof DMF (93% yield NBP vs >99% DMF, 80% purity NBP vs 86% DMF).\nOne\nmajor point of difference was highlighted: NBP is more viscous than\nDMF (4.0 cP vs 0.8 cP) and makes for slower fluid transfer steps during\nsmaller scale SPPS operations.222 Two reports were published in 2020 in which the solvent NBP was\nused in place of traditional solvents. Kumar et al. have successfully\ndemonstrated the use of NBP as a replacement for DMF and NMP SPPS\noperations using both in situ activation and preactivation\nstrategies. Less racemization was observed for reactions conducted\nin NBP, and a reduction in the generation of side-products when forcing\nconditions were utilized was also observed. Thus, NBP has been demonstrated\nas a superior alternative to both DMF and NMP in this study.373 De la Torre et al. report the successful\nuse of NBP in an SPPS\nsequence employing problematic amino acid residue Fmoc-Arg (Pbf)–OH;\npbf = (2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl group).\nThe amino acid residue is particularly troublesome due to its propensity\nto react intramolecularly leading to δ-lactam side product.\nA systematic analysis of reaction conditions allowed for the identification\nof optimum conditions, and NBP was shown to be an excellent alternative\nsolvent to DMF, with levels of amino acid incorporation into the peptide\nbackbone approaching 100%. Purity of the crude peptides was also similar.374 From a safety perspective, it has been\nreported by Erny et al.\nthat the levels of HCN produced in DIC/Oxyma mediate amide bond forming\nreactions can be significantly reduced when a mixture of NBP:EtOAc\n1:4 is employed.375 In conjunction with\ndimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) as a HCN scrubbing additive, the authors\nsuggest that with further developments, the implementation of this\nmethodology combining greener solvents and HCN-free synthesis could\nbe applied to the industrial manufacturing of peptides. Other\nthan NBP, GVL has also been proposed as a potential alternative\nsolvent in SPPS. The group of Albericio and co-workers illustrated\nthat GVL could be utilized in polystyrene (PS)-based SPPS. GVL showed\nexcellent coupling efficiencies in both the synthesis of a pentapeptide\n(Aib-enkephalin) and decapeptide (Aib-ACP), with no major side products\nor ring opening products detected.376 A\nfollow-up to this work was published in 2019 demonstrating the effectiveness\nof GVL in Wang resin SPPS; DCM was effectively replaced as an alternative\nsolvent for the initial anchoring to the Wang resin. Subsequent elongation\nof the peptide was also successfully conducted in GVL with racemization\nand dipeptide formation found to be within acceptable levels.377 Both publications also note the compatibility\nof Fmoc residues in GVL. Most recently, Leko et al. have demonstrated\nthat a combination of EtOAc/CH3CN can be used in chlorotrityl\nchloride and 4-methylbenzhydryl bromide resin loading operations\nwith loading levels comparable to that when DCM, THF, 2-MeTHF, or\nDMF was utilized.378"

      "text": "In recent years,\nthere has been a significant expansion in the field of biocatalysis,\ncommonly using water as a solvent or cosolvent. However, there are\na number of problems associated with the use of water as a solvent\nin biocatalysis, even though it is readily available, is nonhazardous,\nand does not have the flammability or explosion risks associated with\norganic solvents.379 Many synthetically\nuseful reagents, those that are of interest in biocatalytic transformations,\nare poorly water-soluble, which in turn results in a requirement of\nextremely dilute reaction mixtures, leading to increased solvent use.\nThere has been a recent drive for discovery of enzymatic reactions\ncompatible with sustainable organic solvents, most notably 2-MeTHF380 and CPME.168 The most expansive class of enzymatic reaction using 2-MeTHF is that\nof hydrolases, mostly in stereoselective acylations for kinetic resolutions\nof racemates.381−383 In 2017, Secundo and co-workers reported\nthe use of 2-MeTHF in the esterification of a range of natural products\n(menthol, rac-sulcatol and rac-α-cyclogeraniol)\nusing a range of commercial lipases.384 2-MeTHF, as well as CPME, performed well compared to traditional\nsolvents such as toluene and MTBE, with high enantioselectivity. A\nsimilar enzymatic acylation of racemic benzoin in 2-MeTHF, reported\nby Alcántara and colleagues in 2011, using Pseudomonas\nstutzeri lipase (PSL) and Shvo’s catalyst, led to\nkinetic resolution over 48 h, in a 85% yield and 99% e.e. (Scheme 81).385 Numerous additional examples are also found\nwithin the literature using 2-MeTHF as an alternative bio-based solvent,\ntargeting selective acylations of glycosides.386−390 Away from kinetic resolutions, Pseudomonas stutzeri lipase (PSL) has additionally be used as an effective catalyst in\namination reactions of esters, reported by Wong et al. in 2011.391 Shown to form a wide range of alkyl and aryl\namides, 2-MeTHF was reportedly selected due to a high solubilizing\nability of the organic starting materials, with MTBE also shown to\nperform effectively in the transformation. A selection of papers\nusing 2-MeTHF as a bio-based solvent, for\naccessing chiral α-hydroxyketones through either carboligation392,393 or domino enzymatic reactions,394 have\nalso been reported. The first of which, by Domínquez de María\nin 2010, involved use of 2-MeTHF as a (co)solvent alternative to DMSO\nor MTBE for enantioselective C–C bond formation between aldehydes.\nCatalyzed by a thiamine diphosphate-dependent lyase (ThDP-Lyase),\nan efficient enantioselective carboligation of aldehydes to furnish\nchiral α-hydroxyketones was described, providing products in\n>90% yield and generally >95% e.e. (Scheme 82a). A similar report by Rother and co-workers\nin 2012 also used ThDP-Lyase for the umpolung carboligation\nof acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde, examining the relative product distribution\nof the eight possible enantiomeric products.393 (a) Carboligation of aldehydes\nto produce chiral α-hydroxyketones. (b) Domino enzymatic process\nfor the preparation of 2-HPP, with in situ generation\nof acetaldehyde via kinetic resolution. This\nwas further followed up in 2012 by a domino enzymatic cascade\nusing an aldehyde and butyrate or laurate substrate, in the presence\nof Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) and benzaldehyde\nlyase (BAL).394 An initial conversion of\nthe vinyl ester into acetaldehyde, followed by a subsequent C–C\nbond formation with benzaldehyde, catalyzed by BAL, furnished (R)-2-hydroxypropriophenone (2-HPP) in quantitative\nconversion and >99% e.e. (Scheme 82b). Although the majority of biocatalytic transformations\ncarried out\nin organic solvents such as 2-MeTHF fall under the hydrolases class\ndue to their high robustness, a small number of other enzymes are\nalso compatible. In 2014, metagenome screening by Kurokawa and colleagues\nidentified a dehydrogenase enzyme, homologous Leifsoniaadh alcohol\ndehydrogenase (HLADH), which was able to effectively reduce a selection\nof ketones, with high tolerance to 2-MeTHF, in excellent (generally\n>99%) enantiomeric excess.395 Similar\nketone\nreductions have been reported, for example, using YOL151W reductase396 and KREDs (Scheme 83).397 Other than 2-MeTHF, a solvent\n(or cosolvent) that has demonstrated\npotential within biocatalytic transformations is cyclopentyl methyl\nether (CPME). CPME, similar to 2-MeTHF, has proven effective in kinetic\nresolution, such as the one reported by González-Sabín\nand co-workers in 2017.398 As part of a\nkey step in the synthesis of Ivabradine, a drug used for the treatment\nof stable angina pectoris, alkoxycarbonylation kinetic resolution\nof an amine precursor was carried out using the lipase PSC-II and\ndiethylcarbonate, yielding the desired (S)-enantiomer\nin 30% yield, 92% e.e. (Scheme 84). The utility of CPME as a solvent in the reduction of imine-type\nfunctionalities, using IREDs (imine reductases), was reported by Rother\nand Maugeri in 2016.399 Reduction of cyclic\nC=N functionalities using whole cells containing Streptomyces\naurantiacus and Paenibacillus elgii B69\ngave an e.r. of >99:1 under micro aqueous reaction conditions (Scheme 85)."

      "text": "The future direction for organic synthesis\nas a whole will most\nlikely involve a steady transition away from petrochemical-based solvents\nand unsustainable practices. Dwindling palladium stocks and rising\npalladium prices (+2170% in 25 years)400 are surely challenges that will face us all as chemists in the near\nfuture. Even more concerning is the inextricable link between crude\noil price and availability with organic solvent and raw material cost,\nfor example, “oil-price shocks”. Surely it is time for\nus to start to free ourselves from our reliance on petrochemical-derived\nsolvents? The alternatives will likely comprise a combination\nof sustainably\nsourced organic solvents and aqueous–micellar systems. One\ncan envision conventional solvents being retained only for those instances\nwhere no viable alternative has yet been found. What is certain at\nthis time is that there are more than enough evidence, case studies,\nand real world examples to start to promote the early adoption of\nalternative solvent systems. Sometimes a “drop-in” solvent\nreplacement may be sufficient to migrate away from solvents of concern;\nother times a solvent mixture may be more appropriate. Research is\nalso being conducted into the identification of new solvents such\nas 4-MeTHP,401 or TMO,116 or the creation of brand new solvents such as Cyrene.122 Finally, when solvent selection options\nare exhausted, finding\nnew ways of doing things will be critical for moving forward. Telescoping\nreaction steps into “one-pot” methods and utilizing\ncascades, tandem and domino reactions, and multicomponent reactions\nwill surely allow for more efficient synthesis since only one reaction\nmedium is required for multiple steps/transformations.402 Late-stage functionalization also represents\nan enormously powerful technique in opening up more efficient routes\nto targets or even allowing access to targets that might previously\nhave been impossible to make. However, as has been previously demonstrated,\nthe literature’s over reliance on DCE for these reactions is\ntroublesome, and it is the pioneering work from groups such as Ackermann\net al. that will steer the C–H activation community away from\nunsustainable solvent practices. The utilization of enzymatic catalysis\nin organic synthesis will also become more commonplace as the gap\nbetween biology and chemistry narrows and overlaps, for example, see\nthe recent synthesis of Molnupiravir in a 3-step enzymatic cascade\nto produce the COVID-19 antiviral in 69% yield. In this process, a\ncombination of aqueous buffered reaction media and 2-MeTHF as extraction\nsolvent shows that a multidisciplinary approach to sustainability\nmay become more commonplace. The transition away from unsustainable\nsolvent usage practices\nand processes has already begun, and challenges have been identified\nand are gradually being overcome. One case study is the adoption of\nCPME in process chemistry and industry; due to CPME being only available\nfrom one supplier (Zeon), supply chain robustness has been a concern.\nCPME was also absent from the ICH Q3C guidelines for residual solvents\nin APIs. ICH, or the “International Council For Harmonisation\nOf Technical Requirements For Pharmaceuticals For Human Use”\nguidelines are the de facto rules for solvent usage\nand residual solvent levels in API in pharmaceutical manufacturing.\nBecause of this absence in the early days of CPME use, justification\nfor residual levels of CPME would have to be provided, which may have\nbeen deemed to be too costly and time-consuming for the potential\nsustainability improvements achieved.352 CPME is now included in the guidance as of 2020/21.353 Therefore, it is imperative that regulatory\nupdates and guidance are carried out in a time frame that supports\nthe rapidly progressing developments in greener, more sustainable\nprocesses. Responsibility for training new generations of chemists\nis also\ncritical for the successful transition toward more sustainable organic\nsynthesis practices. It is no coincidence that the current generation\nof organic chemists relies so heavily on DMF, THF, and 1,4-dioxane\nas reaction media, after all it is how we were taught and it became\nthe norm. By introducing safer, more sustainable solvents and synthetic\ntechniques into teaching laboratories and organic synthesis lecture\ncourses, the upcoming generation of chemists stands a chance of adopting\nthese practices and challenging the status quo. Support for these\nendeavors will also have to come from top levels of organizations\nto stand a chance of becoming policy and not just personal choice.\nTo quote from Bruce Lipshutz, “the “business as usual”\nmentality is no longer appropriate”.236"

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nSolvents are an integral component within many industries, perhaps\nmost significantly in the paints and coatings sector, which makes\nup for ∼46% of global solvent use. The next largest sector\nis the pharmaceutical industry comprising 9% of global solvent usage,\nclosely followed by the adhesives (6%), printer inks (6%), and cosmetics\n(6%) industries. With respect to the pharmaceutical industry, organic\nsolvent use can account for up to 56% of the entire mass involved\nin the synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).1 If water is included in this same calculation,\nthen up to 88% of the mass of an entire process can be attributed\nto solvent.1 Many traditional solvents\nemployed in organic and medicinal chemistry have associated issues\nsuch as toxicity, environmental, sustainability, and safety concerns.2,3 Thus, reducing the volume of solvent used and using safer and more\nsustainable solvents are two key concepts that are in agreement with\na number of the 12 principles of green chemistry.4 It is the intention of this review to present credible,\ngreener, safer, and more sustainable alternatives to a number of dipolar\naprotic and ethereal solvents with known issues that are to the best\nof current knowledge, safer. Case studies that highlight the successful\nreplacement of problematic solvents in commonly employed synthetic\norganic chemistry with “greener”, more sustainable solvents\nwill also be discussed. Dipolar aprotic solvents are ubiquitous\nin organic chemistry due to their ability to dissolve a wide variety\nof materials (often including salts), their versatility as reaction\nmedia, and often low cost (e.g., anhydrous DMF could recently be purchased\nfor £46.60 for 1 L (>99% purity GC, ≤ 0.1% water)5 and anhydrous 1,4-dioxane could be purchased\nfor £90.40 for 1 L (>99.8%)).6 In\nbulk quantities (not anhydrous), both solvents can be obtained for\nas little as £0.01/mL.7 Another key\nfactor that encourages their widespread use includes the abundance\nand precedence of existing literature supporting their use in myriad\ntransformations and processes. Dipolar aprotic solvents, such as dimethylformamide\n(DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone\n(NMP), acetonitrile (CH3CN), acetone, and tetrahydrofuran\n(THF) are regularly encountered as reaction solvents in chemical transformations.\nA survey of research published in Organic Process Research\nand Development (OPR&D) showed that\nthe most popular dipolar aprotic solvents are DMF, acetonitrile, DMSO,\nand NMP, in that order.8 This is not a\nsignificant change from the order reported for the period of 2007–2012\nother than DMF and acetonitrile swapping places. DMAc was not listed\nin the top 25 solvents employed for 2019.8 Uptake of dimethyl carbonate was however noted and is a promising\nsign that more sustainable solvents are being considered as viable\nalternatives.9 A similar analysis was performed\nfor 2020 and analyzed solvent usage trends in three representative\njournals: OPR&D, the Journal of Medicinal\nChemistry, and Angewandte Chemie. Across\neach of the three distinct journals for the period of 2020, ethereal\nsolvents feature prominently comprised 22–25% of all solvents\nemployed. Dipolar aprotic solvents comprised 17–20% of all\nsolvents used with each class and were similarly represented in each\njournal, see Figure 1. See the Supporting Information for full\nsolvent usage analysis. It is the composition of each of these classes\nthat is of further interest. A closer analysis of each of the\nsolvent categories shows the differences between the particular ethers\nand dipolar aprotics that are employed in each of the three journals’\npublications. THF remains the most popular ethereal solvent across\nall three data sets. Diethyl ether, with its associated flammability\nhazards rendering it particularly unfavorable for large scale work,\ndoes not feature in the top 25 solvents employed in OPR&D in 2020, see Figure 2. Furthermore, it can be seen that alternative ethers such as 2-MeTHF\nfeature far more prominently in OPR&D publications.\nOf note is that 1,4-dioxane does not appear as frequently in publications\nin Angewandte Chemie and we surmise that this is\ndue to the reliance on 1,4-dioxane for cross-coupling in medicinal\nchemistry C–C bond forming reactions, and Boc protecting group\nremoval. When the same analysis is applied to the dipolar aprotic\nclass\nof solvents, it can be seen that publications in the process-scale\nfocused journal OPR&D employed CH3CN as the most common dipolar aprotic. This is in contrast to both J. Med. Chem. and Angewandte Chemie in\nwhich DMF is the most prominent, see Figure 3. One potential reason for this trend may\nbe that solvent selection in process chemistry and scale-up operations\ninvolves far more in-depth risk assessment, which may preclude DMF\nfrom use. This may be due to either physicochemical incompatibilities,\nfor example, DMF is known to be incompatible with sodium hydride,10 or due to regulatory concerns, which are described\nin the following section. Nearly half of all dipolar aprotic\nsolvent usages (with the exception\nof CH3CN) can be attributed to nucleophilic substitution\nreactions (SN2 and SNAr).9 Dipolar aprotic solvents are favored for SN2\nreactions as they do not hydrogen bond to nucleophiles as would a\nprotic solvent, thus promoting the rate of reaction.11,12 Use of dipolar aprotic solvents has also long been known to have\na potentially enormous rate enhancing effect for SNAr reactions.13 1,4-Dioxane, THF, NMP, and DMF are all considered\n“go-to” solvents in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling\nreactions.14,15 The popularity of the less polar\nethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and THF is in part due to their\nability to coordinate reactive species via hydrogen bond accepting\ncapabilities and Lewis basic character.15 Labeling solvents as “aprotic” has long been challenged,16 as a number of what are widely considered “aprotic”\nsolvents are in fact incompatible with very strong bases. Therefore,\nthe terms “dipolar non-hydroxylic” and “dipolar\nnon-hydrogen-bond donor” can also be found in the literature.16 For all their aforementioned advantages, the\nmajority of commonly employed dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents\npose significant concerns from an environmental, health, and safety\nperspective (EHS), the reasons for which are discussed in the next\nsection. The drive to find safer and more sustainable alternatives\nto dipolar aprotic solvents within the pharmaceutical industry has\nbeen a key activity for many years, and it was highlighted in 2007\nas a key research area by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical\nRoundtable (ACS GCI PR).3 The primary motivating\nforce for identifying alternatives for dipolar aprotic solvents is\ndue to the serious health concerns posed by these solvents such as\nreproductive toxicity (DMF, DMAc, NMP).2,17−19 These concerns have also been flagged under European Union Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation,\ncategorizing DMF, DMAc, and NMP as “substances of very high\nconcern” (SVHC).2,17−19 The authorization\nprocess helps to ensure that SVHCs are eventually replaced with less\nhazardous substances where “technically and economically feasible\nalternatives are available”.20 Restrictions\ndiffer in that they are limits or bans on the use of a substance due\nto unacceptable environmental health and safety risks.21 NMP is restricted for use under REACH Annex\nXVII (substances for which certain uses are Restricted)22 due to its reproductive toxicity.17 Annex XVII restrictions as of May 2020 limit\nthe sale of NMP on the marketplace as solutions of concentration >0.3%,\nunless relevant chemical safety reports, data sheets, risk management,\nand appropriate operating conditions for downstream workers are provided.22 DMF and DMAc have also been placed on the candidate\nlist of substances of very high concern;23 the intention of the candidate list is for further restrictions\non use to be assessed for REACH Annex XVII restrictions.23 Similarly, DMF will be restricted from use from\nDecember 2023; specifically DMF “shall not be placed on the\nmarket as a substance on its own, as a constituent of other substances,\nor in mixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.3% after\n12 December 2023 unless manufacturers, importers and downstream users\nhave included in the relevant chemical safety reports and safety data\nsheets, Derived No-Effect Levels (DNELs) relating to exposure of workers\nof 6 mg/m3 for exposure by inhalation and 1.1 mg/kg/day\nfor dermal exposure.”24 Thus, the\nneed to seek alternatives to DMF is now absolutely critical. Thermal\nstability and potential safety hazards associated with the use of\nDMF as a reaction solvent have also recently been reviewed by Yang\net al., highlighting a multitude of potential thermal safety issues\nincluding thermal runaway and explosive decomposition.25 1,4-Dioxane is listed on the US Agency\nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a repository of\nhazardous substances and health effects.26 Both long- and short-term exposure effects are listed as possible\nincluding severe kidney and liver damage and carcinogenicity.26 As of July 2021, the European Chemicals Agency\n(ECHA) has added 1,4-dioxane to its “Candidate List of Substances\nof Very High Concern for Authorization”27 due to its carcinogenic properties and probable serious\neffects to the environment and human health, see Table 1. Thus, 1,4-dioxane is considered a “substance\nof very high concern” (SVHC).23 Solvent\nusage categories across three representative organic chemistry\njournals, 2020.

Solvents are color\ncoded according to a traffic light system where green = solvents with\nfew issues, amber = solvents with some issues, and red = solvents\nwith major issues.44 Categorization of\ndipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents by H-phrases according to the\nwork of McElroy et al.78 Note: Hazard phrases\nare those according to the “Harmonized Classification and Labeling”\nsystem as approved by the EU. See the Supporting Information (Unified Solvent Selection Guide for Dipolar Aprotic\nSolvents) Table S2 for a more in-depth\nanalysis of solvent H-phrase and occupational exposure limits. By 2023, the limit for 1,4-dioxane\nin personal care and cleaning\nproducts in the state of New York will be reduced to just 1 ppm, with\nthe expectation that similar laws will spread nationwide.28 THF is also believed to be a suspect carcinogen,\nsee Table 1. 1,4-Dioxane,\ndiethyl ether, and THF are also known to be peroxide forming solvents\nand are categorized as “Group B: Peroxide hazards on concentration”\nas noted in the review of safety guidelines for peroxidizable chemicals\nby Kelly.29 The hazards present when distilling\ngroup B solvents arise from the fact that the peroxides formed are\noften less volatile than the solvent being distilled; thus, the peroxide\nconcentration in the distillation flask can increase to dangerous\nlevels as the operation proceeds. The formation of peroxides can lead\nto potential explosions30 and can be triggered\nby friction from ground glass stoppers, leading to injury and even\nfatality.31 Peroxide formation can however\nbe mitigated by radical scavengers and stabilizers such as BHT.32 Issues associated with the use of diethyl ether,\naside from peroxide formation, include high volatility,33 low flash point,33 flammability,34 and explosivity.30 Furthermore, diethyl ether has formerly been\nutilized as an anesthetic36 and has been\nknown as a substance with a potential for recreational abuse as early\nas the 1800s.37 Other less commonly employed\nethers such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane are also known to be flammable,\nacutely toxic by inhalation, and to show reproductive toxicity.38 With traditionally employed dipolar aprotic\nsolvents coming under\nincreased scrutiny by legislative bodies, a time may come in the not\nso distant future that sees their use severely curtailed. Such a situation\n(albeit not for a dipolar aprotic solvent) has already been observed\nfor halogenated solvent dichloroethane (DCE).39 Special authorization is now required for the use of DCE\non an industrial scale. Furthermore, the permit, once granted, is\nonly valid for 4–12 years, on a case-dependent basis. The short-term\nnature of the permits is intended to drive the chemical industry to\nfind alternative solvents for DCE, which is a go-to solvent for much\nof the current pioneering academic research in C–H bond activation.39 Other factors that require consideration,\noutside of direct legislative\nconcerns, are how to dispose of dipolar aprotic solvents postreaction.\nOften, boiling points of dipolar aprotic solvents are elevated, see Table 1, making distillation\nand recovery challenging on scale, or indeed so energy intensive as\nto preclude this method of recovery.2 Instead,\nremoval from reaction mixtures can be achieved by aqueous workup.\nThe mixed aqueous–organic waste must then be safely and responsibly\ndisposed of, for example, by incineration unless biological wastewater\ntreatment has been shown to be possible. To overcome the challenges\nposed by the changing legislative landscape,\nand to answer the direct call from industry to find alternative solvents,\npioneering research has been conducted over the past ten years. Considerable\nprogress in identifying alternative solvents and reaction conditions\nfor traditional dipolar aprotic solvents has been made, and examples\nand case studies will be discussed in the next section. Recent years have seen\na flurry of activity to explore novel bioderived solvents. The major\ndriving forces for such interest, which are described in the previous\nsection, include legislative pressure, pressure to improve industrial\nsustainability, reduction in global carbon footprint, and a move away\nfrom petrochemical derived products toward those that are sustainably\nsourced. Many of these goals are encompassed by the UN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals, for example, Goal 12: “Ensure sustainable\nconsumption and production patterns”40 and Goal 13: “Take urgent action to combat climate change\nand its impacts”.41 It should\nbe noted that the source of a solvent is just one aspect of its lifecycle.\nThe energy, water, and reagents, etc. used in the production of the\nsolvent should also be considered, along with its disposal, that is,\na life cycle assessment.42 Separate from\na full LCA (where this information is available), other aspects of\na solvent’s overall “greenness” that might be\nmore readily assessed include its biodegradability, volatility, and\ntoxicity. Multiple pharmaceutical companies, universities, and research\ninstitutions have attempted to score these attributes using multiparameter\nchemometric analysis, and a number of solvent selection guides have\nbeen produced including guides from Chem21,43 GSK,44 Sanofi,45 AstraZeneca (AZ),46 Pfizer,47 and the ACS GCI PR.48 Furthermore, computational tools49,50 and machine-learning51 have also been investigated to assist in the\nsolvent selection process. Other industries outside the realms of\nsynthetic chemistry, such as printed electronics, are also developing\nnew tools and methods in solvent selection for their selected specific\nneeds and applications.52 Over a\ndecade has passed since the call for finding replacement\ndipolar aprotic solvents was made by the ACS GCI PR.3 In the intervening years, a number of key advances have\nbeen made to tackle this challenge.2 Developments\nin the area of greener and more sustainable solvents are regularly\nhighlighted in the series “Green Chemistry Articles of Interest\nto the Pharmaceutical Industry” published a number of times\nper year by Organic Process Research and Development (OPR&D) since 2008.53 Original and inventive research utilizing surfactant–water\nchemistry, such as that championed by Handa et al. and Lipshutz et\nal., is challenging the very concept of employing organic solvents\nas reaction media. Instead, it is suggested that significantly important\ntransformations employed in medicinal chemistry, such as amide bond\nformation and metal catalyzed cross-coupling, can be conducted in\nsurfactant–water systems.15,54−59 Key developments have also been made in identifying and discovering\nnew dipolar aprotic solvents with improved safety, sustainability,\nand green chemistry criteria such as N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\npropylene carbonate, dimethyl isosorbide, and dihydrolevoglucosenone\n(Cyrene).2 Recently, new candidates such\nas diformylxylose have also been proposed as a replacements for traditional\ndipolar aprotics, though no toxicity studies have yet been conducted\non this solvent.60 Also of significance\nis the growing body of literature employing these alternative reaction\nsolvents and conditions. The growth of literature adopting greener,\nmore sustainable solvents is reinforcing the position that these replacement\nsolvents are genuinely an improvement on the current state of the\nart and are a credible alternative to the current status quo. EHS\nevaluations of these new solvents are also ongoing to avoid the potential\nsituation that a replacement solvent could pose toxic effects to the\nend user or detrimental effects to the environment.61,62 Avoiding the promotion of solvents that are just as bad or worse\nfor the user/environment has long been considered63 and remains critically important today. In the following\nsection, some of the recent advances made in identifying,\nto the best of our knowledge, more preferable, alternative solvents\nfor dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents are discussed in conjunction\nwith their production, physical, and chemical properties. It is the\nintention of the authors that these examples can be used as literature\ncase studies and for inspiration and guidance in making judicious\nsolvent selection in chemical processes. More esoteric technologies\nsuch as deep eutectic solvents and ionic liquids have purposely been\nomitted as they are topics requiring reviews of their own. A recently\npublished review by Gao et al. critically discusses replacement strategies\nfor dipolar aprotic solvents and includes both topics. We point the\nreader toward this review for further information.64 Tables of physicochemical properties,\nHansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and Kamlet–Taft (KT) parameters,\nhave been included as both a reference guide and to facilitate the\ncomparison and contrast of various solvents of interest. Plotting\nHSP parameters in a 3-dimensional space or sphere gives what is known\nas the “Hansen space”.65 Solvents\nthat are close in Hansen space can often exhibit similar solvency\npower. For example, solvents that were within 3 MPa1/2 of\neach other were identified as potential NMP and DCM replacements by\nPacheco et al.66 Chemometric tools have\nalso been developed to explore the Hansen space and to identify sets\nof greener solvents that could potentially be screened for their solubilizing\nproperties.67 HSP values can also be calculated\nfor solutes; the closer a solute’s HSP profile is to a known\nsolvent, the more likely it is to dissolve in that solvent. HSP values\nfor solvent blends can also be predicted predicted.68−70 Kamlet–Taft\nparameters describe linear free-energy relationships and are useful\nfor correlating solvent properties with reaction kinetics and processes\nin equilibrium.71 Dipolar aprotic solvents\ncharacteristically exhibit no hydrogen bond acidity (HBA) α\nwith the exception of acetone (0.06) and acetonitrile (0.19). Kamlet–Taft\nparameters can be plotted against each other to produce solvent maps\nthat highlight areas of similarity and difference between solvents\nand solvent classes, for example, see Figure 4. Methodology for replacing dipolar aprotic\nsolvents by using Kamlet–Taft parameters has been described\nby Duereh et al.72 Kamlet–Taft H-bond\nbasicity (β) plotted versus dipolarity\n(π*) for aprotic solvents (in purple) and protic solvents (in\ngreen).

Dipolar aprotic solvents, such as dimethylformamide\n(DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone\n(NMP), acetonitrile (CH3CN), acetone, and tetrahydrofuran\n(THF) are regularly encountered as reaction solvents in chemical transformations.\nA survey of research published in Organic Process Research\nand Development (OPR&D) showed that\nthe most popular dipolar aprotic solvents are DMF, acetonitrile, DMSO,\nand NMP, in that order.8 This is not a\nsignificant change from the order reported for the period of 2007–2012\nother than DMF and acetonitrile swapping places. DMAc was not listed\nin the top 25 solvents employed for 2019.8 Uptake of dimethyl carbonate was however noted and is a promising\nsign that more sustainable solvents are being considered as viable\nalternatives.9 A similar analysis was performed\nfor 2020 and analyzed solvent usage trends in three representative\njournals: OPR&D, the Journal of Medicinal\nChemistry, and Angewandte Chemie. Across\neach of the three distinct journals for the period of 2020, ethereal\nsolvents feature prominently comprised 22–25% of all solvents\nemployed. Dipolar aprotic solvents comprised 17–20% of all\nsolvents used with each class and were similarly represented in each\njournal, see Figure 1. See the Supporting Information for full\nsolvent usage analysis. It is the composition of each of these classes\nthat is of further interest. A closer analysis of each of the\nsolvent categories shows the differences between the particular ethers\nand dipolar aprotics that are employed in each of the three journals’\npublications. THF remains the most popular ethereal solvent across\nall three data sets. Diethyl ether, with its associated flammability\nhazards rendering it particularly unfavorable for large scale work,\ndoes not feature in the top 25 solvents employed in OPR&D in 2020, see Figure 2. Furthermore, it can be seen that alternative ethers such as 2-MeTHF\nfeature far more prominently in OPR&D publications.\nOf note is that 1,4-dioxane does not appear as frequently in publications\nin Angewandte Chemie and we surmise that this is\ndue to the reliance on 1,4-dioxane for cross-coupling in medicinal\nchemistry C–C bond forming reactions, and Boc protecting group\nremoval. When the same analysis is applied to the dipolar aprotic\nclass\nof solvents, it can be seen that publications in the process-scale\nfocused journal OPR&D employed CH3CN as the most common dipolar aprotic. This is in contrast to both J. Med. Chem. and Angewandte Chemie in\nwhich DMF is the most prominent, see Figure 3. One potential reason for this trend may\nbe that solvent selection in process chemistry and scale-up operations\ninvolves far more in-depth risk assessment, which may preclude DMF\nfrom use. This may be due to either physicochemical incompatibilities,\nfor example, DMF is known to be incompatible with sodium hydride,10 or due to regulatory concerns, which are described\nin the following section. Nearly half of all dipolar aprotic\nsolvent usages (with the exception\nof CH3CN) can be attributed to nucleophilic substitution\nreactions (SN2 and SNAr).9 Dipolar aprotic solvents are favored for SN2\nreactions as they do not hydrogen bond to nucleophiles as would a\nprotic solvent, thus promoting the rate of reaction.11,12 Use of dipolar aprotic solvents has also long been known to have\na potentially enormous rate enhancing effect for SNAr reactions.13 1,4-Dioxane, THF, NMP, and DMF are all considered\n“go-to” solvents in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling\nreactions.14,15 The popularity of the less polar\nethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and THF is in part due to their\nability to coordinate reactive species via hydrogen bond accepting\ncapabilities and Lewis basic character.15 Labeling solvents as “aprotic” has long been challenged,16 as a number of what are widely considered “aprotic”\nsolvents are in fact incompatible with very strong bases. Therefore,\nthe terms “dipolar non-hydroxylic” and “dipolar\nnon-hydrogen-bond donor” can also be found in the literature.16 For all their aforementioned advantages, the\nmajority of commonly employed dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents\npose significant concerns from an environmental, health, and safety\nperspective (EHS), the reasons for which are discussed in the next\nsection.\n\n## Driving Change: Environmental Health and Safety\nConcerns\nThe drive to find safer and more sustainable alternatives\nto dipolar aprotic solvents within the pharmaceutical industry has\nbeen a key activity for many years, and it was highlighted in 2007\nas a key research area by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical\nRoundtable (ACS GCI PR).3 The primary motivating\nforce for identifying alternatives for dipolar aprotic solvents is\ndue to the serious health concerns posed by these solvents such as\nreproductive toxicity (DMF, DMAc, NMP).2,17−19 These concerns have also been flagged under European Union Registration,\nEvaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation,\ncategorizing DMF, DMAc, and NMP as “substances of very high\nconcern” (SVHC).2,17−19 The authorization\nprocess helps to ensure that SVHCs are eventually replaced with less\nhazardous substances where “technically and economically feasible\nalternatives are available”.20 Restrictions\ndiffer in that they are limits or bans on the use of a substance due\nto unacceptable environmental health and safety risks.21 NMP is restricted for use under REACH Annex\nXVII (substances for which certain uses are Restricted)22 due to its reproductive toxicity.17 Annex XVII restrictions as of May 2020 limit\nthe sale of NMP on the marketplace as solutions of concentration >0.3%,\nunless relevant chemical safety reports, data sheets, risk management,\nand appropriate operating conditions for downstream workers are provided.22 DMF and DMAc have also been placed on the candidate\nlist of substances of very high concern;23 the intention of the candidate list is for further restrictions\non use to be assessed for REACH Annex XVII restrictions.23 Similarly, DMF will be restricted from use from\nDecember 2023; specifically DMF “shall not be placed on the\nmarket as a substance on its own, as a constituent of other substances,\nor in mixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 0.3% after\n12 December 2023 unless manufacturers, importers and downstream users\nhave included in the relevant chemical safety reports and safety data\nsheets, Derived No-Effect Levels (DNELs) relating to exposure of workers\nof 6 mg/m3 for exposure by inhalation and 1.1 mg/kg/day\nfor dermal exposure.”24 Thus, the\nneed to seek alternatives to DMF is now absolutely critical. Thermal\nstability and potential safety hazards associated with the use of\nDMF as a reaction solvent have also recently been reviewed by Yang\net al., highlighting a multitude of potential thermal safety issues\nincluding thermal runaway and explosive decomposition.25 1,4-Dioxane is listed on the US Agency\nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), a repository of\nhazardous substances and health effects.26 Both long- and short-term exposure effects are listed as possible\nincluding severe kidney and liver damage and carcinogenicity.26 As of July 2021, the European Chemicals Agency\n(ECHA) has added 1,4-dioxane to its “Candidate List of Substances\nof Very High Concern for Authorization”27 due to its carcinogenic properties and probable serious\neffects to the environment and human health, see Table 1. Thus, 1,4-dioxane is considered a “substance\nof very high concern” (SVHC).23 Solvent\nusage categories across three representative organic chemistry\njournals, 2020. Percent solvent use included as data label. Percentage solvent composition of the ether class. Percentage solvent composition of the dipolar aprotic\nclass.

Solvents arranged\nin\norder of decreasing ETN. Solvents not part of original publication\nbut scored according to published methodology. Solvents are color\ncoded according to a traffic light system where green = solvents with\nfew issues, amber = solvents with some issues, and red = solvents\nwith major issues.44 Categorization of\ndipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents by H-phrases according to the\nwork of McElroy et al.78 Note: Hazard phrases\nare those according to the “Harmonized Classification and Labeling”\nsystem as approved by the EU. See the Supporting Information (Unified Solvent Selection Guide for Dipolar Aprotic\nSolvents) Table S2 for a more in-depth\nanalysis of solvent H-phrase and occupational exposure limits. By 2023, the limit for 1,4-dioxane\nin personal care and cleaning\nproducts in the state of New York will be reduced to just 1 ppm, with\nthe expectation that similar laws will spread nationwide.28 THF is also believed to be a suspect carcinogen,\nsee Table 1. 1,4-Dioxane,\ndiethyl ether, and THF are also known to be peroxide forming solvents\nand are categorized as “Group B: Peroxide hazards on concentration”\nas noted in the review of safety guidelines for peroxidizable chemicals\nby Kelly.29 The hazards present when distilling\ngroup B solvents arise from the fact that the peroxides formed are\noften less volatile than the solvent being distilled; thus, the peroxide\nconcentration in the distillation flask can increase to dangerous\nlevels as the operation proceeds. The formation of peroxides can lead\nto potential explosions30 and can be triggered\nby friction from ground glass stoppers, leading to injury and even\nfatality.31 Peroxide formation can however\nbe mitigated by radical scavengers and stabilizers such as BHT.32 Issues associated with the use of diethyl ether,\naside from peroxide formation, include high volatility,33 low flash point,33 flammability,34 and explosivity.30 Furthermore, diethyl ether has formerly been\nutilized as an anesthetic36 and has been\nknown as a substance with a potential for recreational abuse as early\nas the 1800s.37 Other less commonly employed\nethers such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane are also known to be flammable,\nacutely toxic by inhalation, and to show reproductive toxicity.38 With traditionally employed dipolar aprotic\nsolvents coming under\nincreased scrutiny by legislative bodies, a time may come in the not\nso distant future that sees their use severely curtailed. Such a situation\n(albeit not for a dipolar aprotic solvent) has already been observed\nfor halogenated solvent dichloroethane (DCE).39 Special authorization is now required for the use of DCE\non an industrial scale. Furthermore, the permit, once granted, is\nonly valid for 4–12 years, on a case-dependent basis. The short-term\nnature of the permits is intended to drive the chemical industry to\nfind alternative solvents for DCE, which is a go-to solvent for much\nof the current pioneering academic research in C–H bond activation.39 Other factors that require consideration,\noutside of direct legislative\nconcerns, are how to dispose of dipolar aprotic solvents postreaction.\nOften, boiling points of dipolar aprotic solvents are elevated, see Table 1, making distillation\nand recovery challenging on scale, or indeed so energy intensive as\nto preclude this method of recovery.2 Instead,\nremoval from reaction mixtures can be achieved by aqueous workup.\nThe mixed aqueous–organic waste must then be safely and responsibly\ndisposed of, for example, by incineration unless biological wastewater\ntreatment has been shown to be possible. To overcome the challenges\nposed by the changing legislative landscape,\nand to answer the direct call from industry to find alternative solvents,\npioneering research has been conducted over the past ten years. Considerable\nprogress in identifying alternative solvents and reaction conditions\nfor traditional dipolar aprotic solvents has been made, and examples\nand case studies will be discussed in the next section.\n\n## Recent Developments in Greener, More Sustainable\nSolvents and Reaction Methodology\nRecent years have seen\na flurry of activity to explore novel bioderived solvents.

An overview of their key\nfeatures and physicochemical properties that have made them attractive\nalternatives will be highlighted. Recent reclassification of the “greenness”\nof certain solvents such as sulfolane (due to reproductive\ntoxicity effects) are also noted. Specific examples and case studies\nhighlighting successful solvent replacements using these solvents\nwill be discussed later. Selection of proposed, greener, safer, more\nsustainable solvents. Cyrene, or dihydrolevoglucosenone,\nsee Figure 6, is a\ndipolar aprotic solvent that was designed as a potential alternative\nto common REACH-restricted solvents such as NMP and DMF.80 It is produced from renewable resources (accessed\nfrom cellulose in two steps, Scheme 1), can be considered as readily biodegradable, possesses\nlow acute oral toxicity, and has not demonstrated mutagenicity by\nAmes testing. Ocular irritation has however been reported.118 The Kamlet–Taft and HSP parameters for\nCyrene were calculated, and it was shown to occupy a similar Hansen\nsolvent space to NMP, see Table 2.80 HSP: van der Waals forces (δD),\npolarity (δP), and hydrogen bonding (δH). Kamlet–Taft:\nDipolarity/polarizability (π*), hydrogen-bonding acidity (donor)\n(α), and hydrogen-bonding basicity (acceptor) (β). Solvent\nordered by empirical solvent polarity, as in Table 1. Bio-based solvent\n“Cyrene”. Cyrene has been successfully employed as a solvent in multiple\ntransformations including palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions,14 acid chloride and amide synthesis,119,120 urea synthesis,121 MOF synthesis,122 and fabrication of water filtration membranes.123,124 For a review of Cyrene production and utilization, see Camp et al.125 The solubility of solutes in Cyrene has been\nshown to be dependent on the water content of Cyrene.126 An equilibrium between Cyrene’s ketone\nand a geminal diol form exists. Maximum solubility of solutes was\nfound to be associated with the presence of the diol form. These observations\nhave further led Cyrene to be considered as a solvent with potentially\ntunable or switchable properties.126 The\nuse of Cyrene with bases however must be appropriately considered\nas a number of inorganic bases react with Cyrene, catalyzing aldol\naddition. Furthermore, amines can react with Cyrene if heated, although\ntriethylamine at 30 °C has been found to be tolerated.127 The Cygnet class\nof solvents, Figure 7, refers to functionalized, ketal-protected variants of the previously\ndiscussed Cyrene.66 These derivatives are\nmore stable than the unprotected ketone Cyrene, and were purposely\ndesigned to act as more inert forms of the original solvent, given\nthat the ketone can be unstable under acidic conditions. The simplest\nCygnet variant, Cygnet 0.0, is functionalized such that the ketone\nis protected with ethylene glycol, with the higher variants protected\nwith derivatized ethylene glycol variants.128 Cyrene\nderived “Cygnet” family of solvents. Each variation can be prepared by condensation of the corresponding\ndiol with Cyrene in the presence of an acid clay catalyst, liberating\nonly water as a byproduct.66 Five variants\nof Cygnet have been synthesized to date, with their nomenclature based\non the number of carbon atoms in the chain attached to each of the\ntwo ketal carbon atoms (e.g., Cygnet 1.1 contains 1 carbon atom, a\nmethyl group, attached to each carbon of ethylene glycol). Because\nof the increased molecular weight of Cygnet derivatives compared with\nCyrene, the melting point of each solvent (e.g., for Cygnet 0.0, >\n70 °C) can lead to more difficult handling as a solvent. Of particular\ninterest is the use of Cygnet 0.0 as a solvent, given that the predicted\nHansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) place it in a similar part of Hansen\nSolubility Space as dichloromethane (DCM); however, alternatives\nto chlorinated solvents were the focus of a recent review by some\nof the authors of this work and are not covered here.8,66 To date, Cygnet 0.0 has been screened as a potential green solvent\nfor dissolution of polymers for NIPS membrane casting.128 Toxicity and mutagenicity testing is underway\nfor Cygnet 0.0, although Cygnet variants are predicted to be nontoxic\nand nonmutagenic.66 Cygnet 0.0 and Cyrene\nblends have been successfully utilized in the biocatalytic synthesis\nof polyesters, effectively replacing traditionally employed polar\naprotic solvents.129 Carbonate-based solvents\ncount dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl\ncarbonate, ethylene carbonate, and propylene carbonate, see Figure 8, among the most\npopular and widely used exemplars. Of the aforementioned solvents,\npropylene and ethylene carbonate score most favorably according to\nthe GSK solvent selection guide,44 though\ntheir elevated boiling points (242 and 248 °C, respectively)\nmay preclude their use in some applications. Depending on the polarity\nof the product, partitioning of high boiling solvents into an aqueous\nlayer followed by product extraction with an immiscible nonpolar solvent\ncan be achieved.2 However, this additional\nstep inevitably increases process mass intensity and waste generation\nvia the introduction of an additional solvent. Propylene carbonate\nsynthesis and production have been discussed by Forero et al. in their\nreview of propylene carbonate as a green solvent;130 multiple methods utilize CO2 as a carbon source\nin conjunction with other potentially renewable starting materials.\nPropylene carbonate occupies a Hansen solvent space close to acetonitrile,\nsee Table 2, giving\na rough indication of comparable solvating ability. Potential applications\nfor carbonate based solvents include, but are not limited to, metal\ncatalyzed cross-coupling reactions,107 proline-catalyzed\naldol reactions,131 hydrosilylation,132 cyanohydrin synthesis,133 proline-catalyzed hydrazination,134 amine-electrophile SN2 chemistry,135 and the Appel reaction.136 Some commonly\nemployed carbonate-based solvents. γ-Valerolactone,\nsee Figure 9, is a\nhigh boiling (207 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent and platform molecule137 that can be isolated from lignocellulosic biomass\nvia levulinic acid.138 Multiple reviews\nand methods of its production have been published; 128 patents mention\nGVL, and it is present as a product in 567 separate publications.139 GVL has enjoyed moderate uptake as a reaction\nsolvent across a wide variety of chemistry types. A search conducted\nusing SciFinder shows that GVL has been employed as reaction solvent\nin 750 reactions across 108 publications, more than three-quarters\nof which have been published since 2014.140 Applications of this solvent as a reaction medium including palladium-catalyzed\ncross-coupling,141 electrochemistry,142 lignin depolymerization,143 C–H activation chemistry,144 and solid phase peptide synthesis.145 The success and wide variety of applications in which GVL has been\nemployed are in part due to GVL’s favorable solvent properties;\nKamlet–Taft parameters are comparable to DMF and DMAc and COSMO-RS\nmodeling, and HSP comparisons have shown GVL to be most similar to\nacetone, NMP, DMF, and DMAc.146 Biodegradation\nstudies have shown GVL to rapidly and completely break down in aquatic\nenvironments, and it has been demonstrated to be less toxic to humans\nthat comparable dipolar aprotic solvents.146 Caution however must be taken when utilizing GVL as it is a known\nprodrug for γ-hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV), which itself has been\nnoted as an alternative for UK Class C drug γ-hydroxybutyric\nacid (GHB),147 possession of which is punishable\nby up to 2 years imprisonment. Therefore, it is the authors suggestion\nthat use and inventory/storage of this solvent be treated with caution\ndue to its sedative properties, potential for abuse, and potential\nfor future legislative restriction. Furthermore, due to the aforementioned\nconcerns, the authors have opted not to recommend GVL as a replacement\nsolvent in the condensed solvent selection guide provided in the Supporting Information (Unified Solvent Selection\nGuide for Dipolar Aprotic Solvents). γ-Valerolactone. Sulfolane, see Figure 10, is a high-boiling\n(285 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent developed by Shell, and it has\nseen use in industrial applications in gas and oil refining, for example,\nthe Sulfinol Process.148 Sulfolane can\nbe produced industrially via the reaction of SO2 with butadiene\nfollowed by hydrogenation of the intermediate sulfolene to give sulfolane.149 HSP values for sulfolane suggest that is has\nvery high solubilizing power for polar compounds, similar to DMSO,\nsee Table 2. Sulfolane\nalso possesses one of the highest Kamlet–Taft polarizability/dipolarity\nscores (π* = 0.90) of any of the solvents in Table 2, only DMSO is higher at 1.00.\nSulfolane’s hydrogen bond basicity β is much lower however\nat 0.39 compared to DMSO 0.76 and is closer to propylene carbonate\nin this parameter (π* = 0.90, β = 0.38). Sulfolane is\nimmiscible with alkanes and MTBE, which can allow for facile workups\nand product extraction of MTBE soluble products.149 Sulfolane has previously been considered as a safer dipolar\naprotic solvent including for the fact that sulfolane has a much lower\nskin permeability than DMSO, DMF, DMAc, and NMP.149 Sulfolane, however, has been identified as potentially\nmore hazardous than originally thought. A study on the reproductive\ntoxicity effects of sulfolane in rats has suggested that the solvent\ncould harm unborn child.150 Some SDS now\ncarry a H360 warning to reflect this evidence.151 Furthermore, sulfolane has been recategorized according\nto the Chem21 solvent selection guide from “recommended”\nto “hazardous”.43 Sulfolane\ncontamination of groundwater and drinking water was reported near\nthe oil refinery in the community of Fairbanks, Alaska.152 Thus, it is the authors’ recommendation\nthat sulfolane is not considered as a suitable green solvent. For\na review of reactions conducted using sulfolane, see Tilstam et al.149 Sulfolane. 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran, see Figure 11, is an ethereal solvent that can be derived\nfrom renewable resources such as levulinic acid or furfural,153 which can themselves be derived from agricultural\nwaste such as corn stover, sugar cane bagasse, and rice straw.154 Life cycle assessment conducted on 2-MeTHF\nhas shown that production of the solvent from furfural derived from\ncorn-cob waste can reduce emissions by up to 97% when compared to\na traditional chemical synthesis of THF,155 though it is not always clear how individual supplies of 2-MeTHF\nare currently made. Structurally, 2-MeTHF differs from THF by the\naddition of one single methyl group, yet this addition is responsible\nfor several significantly different physiochemical properties. First,\nthe boiling point is elevated by 13 °C, see Table 1. 2-MeTHF is significantly less\nmiscible with water at room temperature (129.2 g/L)156 than THF (494.7 g/L).157 This\nimmiscibility has led 2-MeTHF to be employed as an extraction solvent\nand also as an organic component in aqueous–organic biphasic\nreaction mixtures.158 Interestingly, 2-MeTHF\nis also inversely soluble in water; at 0 °C, 2-MeTHF is 21 wt\n% soluble in water, whereas at 19 °C, this is reduced to 14 wt\n% and at 50 °C it is just 7.8 wt %.159 2-MeTHF is also more stable to acidic hydrolysis than THF and has\na longer t1/2 for R-Li mediated decomposition\nwhen compared to THF (130 min vs 10 min at 35 °C),158 though it is still susceptible to peroxide\nformation.160 As 2-MeTHF occupies a very\nsimilar solvent space to THF, see Table 2, it has been promoted as a “drop-in”\nreplacement for THF that is greener and more sustainable. A number\nof reagent solutions are now commercially available in 2-MeTHF such\nas Grignard and lithium reagents,161 further\npromoting their uptake as viable alternatives to THF and diethyl ether.153 Use of 2-MeTHF has seen gradual increase as\nnoted in the solvent use survey conducted by Ashcroft et al. (14%\nof publications in OPR&D for the period of 2009–2012 utilized\n2-MeTHF in some stage of the reported synthesis).9 Many reviews of solvents ignore price, as such information\ncan vary greatly depending on geography, purchasing contracts, or\ntime. However, it is instructive to note that a price comparison of\n2-MeTHF and THF was conducted in 2021 using Sigma-Aldrich’s\nwebsite, see Table 3. Search criteria used were anhydrous solvents containing 250 ppm\nbutylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) inhibitor and a purity of ≥99.9%.\nCost per liter of 2-MeTHF is nearly 2.5-times greater than standard\nTHF at the purity and grade that were considered. However, economies\nof scale come into effect at 200 L drum size; 2-MeTHF was only 13%\nmore expensive than THF. Depending on the details of the reaction\nconcerned, it is therefore easily conceivable that the increased cost\nof purchase could be offset by other reduced costs (e.g., less aqueous\nwaste for incineration). For further reviews of 2-MeTHF use, see Pace\net al. 2012,153 Monticelli et al. 2017,160 and most recently Bijoy et al. 2021.162 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran. Cyclopentyl\nmethyl ether, see Figure 12, is a hydrophobic ethereal solvent with a high boiling point\n(106 °C), see Table 1. It became a credible alternative to many ethereal solvents,\nsuch as THF and 1,4-dioxane, when commercial quantities became available\nin 2005.165 CPME can be produced from either\ncyclopentanol or from cyclopentene, see Scheme 2.165 The similar\nHSP parameters of CPME to other ethereal solvents (and their proximity\nto one another in Hansen space), such as 1,4-dioxane and THF, give\nan indication that CPME likely possesses similar solubilizing capabilities,80 see Table 2. CPME can be made from renewable resources, although\nit is not currently commercially available via a biobased route, and\noffers other benefits, including significantly safer handling and\nrelative stability under acidic and basic conditions.165 Peroxide formation is still an issue however,\nand butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is still required as an additive\nto prevent oxidation.165,103,166 Toxicological assessment of CPME was conducted by Watanabe et al.\nin 2013, and it was shown to have relatively low acute toxicity, and\nwas shown not to be a skin sensitizer nor a mutagen. Eye and skin\nirritation were however observed.167 The\npotential for this solvent to become a solvent for use in process\nchemistry was reviewed in 2007165 and more\nrecently in 2019168 where its position\nas a more sustainable, environmentally friendly ether has become reinforced.\nApplications where it has been successfully employed include organometallic\nchemistry, transition metal catalysis, acid catalysis, amidation reactions,\noxidations, radical reactions, and as an organic phase in biphasic\nchemistry.168 For specific examples, see\nreviews by Azzena et al.,168 Watanabe et\nal.,165 and most recently Bijoy et al.162 Cyclopentyl methyl ether. Methyl tert-butyl ether\n(MTBE), see Figure 13, sometimes referred\nto as tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME), is a volatile\n(bp 55 °C), flammable, colorless liquid that is commonly used\nas a fuel additive to reduce detonation risk in addition to reducing\nunwanted emissions.169 Similar to other\nethers, MTBE is often used in the place of THF and diethyl ether due\nto its significantly lower risk of peroxide formation, with the tert-butyl group thought to contribute to this.170 In comparison with other ethereal solvents,\nMTBE does, however, have a much lower flash point (−28 °C,\ncompared with −14.5 °C for THF and −1 °C for\nCPME), see Table 4.166 Furthermore, there have been some health concerns\nrelated to MTBE, with links to endocrine disruption.172 MTBE is synthesized industrially in a similar way to CPME,\nthrough the reaction of methanol (derived from natural gas), and isobutylene,\nsourced from the dehydrogenation of isobutane.173 Methyl tert-butyl ether. MTBE has\nbeen used as a solvent in reaction classes including C–H\nborylations,174 Suzuki-Miyaura couplings,174 palladium-catalyzed silyl enolate alkylations,\nand Sonogashira cross-couplings.175 It\nhas additionally been known to be used as an alternative greener solvent\nin normal-phase column chromatography,176 and as an alternative extraction solvent due to its immiscibility\nwith water.177 Unlike other ethers, the\nlow Lewis basicity of MTBE results in incompatibility with formation\nof Grignard reagents and limits use in lithiations. Both\ncyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, see Figure 14, have been promoted as alternative dipolar\naprotic ketone solvent replacements that can be potentially produced\nfrom biorenewable resources.178 Cyclopentanone\ncan be produced from the biobased platform molecule furfural,179 and cyclohexanone by catalytic reduction of\naromatic ethers such as anisole.180 Both\nsolvents score highly according to the GSK solvent selection guide\nas potentially greener and more sustainable ketone solvents for myriad\nreasons including favorable recyclability scoring, minimal known measured\naquatic impact, moderate to good exposure and health hazard scoring,\nand a good reactivity and flammability score.44 Both cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone have boiling points that are\nelevated (cyclopentanone 129 °C, cyclohexanone 155 °C (Table 1) and occupy a similar\nHansen solubility space to each other when comparing δD and\nδH. However, the polarity parameter or δP differs significantly;\ncyclopentanone is 11.9, whereas cyclohexanone is 8.4, see Table 2, suggesting that\ncyclopentanone is more polar than cyclohexanone. This is at odds with\nthe Reichardt polarity parameter (0.281 vs 0.269, Table 1). When examining the Kamlet–Taft\nparameters, cyclopentanone possesses a larger π* (0.76 vs 0.68)\nand both solvents have nearly identical hydrogen bond basicity β\nof (0.52 and 0.53). π* as a measure of dipolarity/polarizability\nis in agreement with the information provided by the HSP parameters;\ncyclopentanone is “more polar” by this measure than\ncyclohexanone. Cyclopentanone has been successfully employed as solvent\nin several processes. A SciFinder analysis of the literature shows\nthat 74 nonparticipating single-step transformations have been reported\nin 29 different journal publications.181 Uses include solvent in photoredox catalysis,182 aldol reactions (as both solvent and reagent),183 and solvent for Steglich-type thioester formation,184 transition metal catalysis,185 and total synthesis.186 Similarly,\ncyclohexanone has seen use in 1545 reactions in 421 journal publications.187 Uses include transition metal catalysis,188,189 aldol reactions,190 total synthesis,191 and as a general synthesis solvent in medicinal\nchemistry drug discovery.192 Aside from\ntheir use as solvents, both cyclic ketones have found significant\nuse as organic chemistry building-blocks; cyclohexanone is an important\nprecursor for Nylon-6.193 Cyclic ketones cyclopentanone\n(left) and cyclohexanone (right). TMO or 2,2,5,5-tetramethyltetrahydrofuran (TMTHF), see Figure 15, is a volatile\nnonpolar (VNP) ether that was identified as a potential replacement\nfor volatile and peroxide forming ethers and also toluene as part\nof the ReSolve project.194 Specific properties\nof a boiling point of <115 °C and nonperoxide forming characteristics\nwere required, and TMO fulfilled these criteria (bp 112 °C, Table 1) from a selection\nof other quaternary alpha-carbon ether hydrocarbons that were considered.103 TMO can be synthesized from 2,5-dimethylhexane-2,5-diol\n(which itself can be potentially produced from renewable resources)\nvia a dehydration reaction.103 Additionally,\na recent report by Byrne et al. compared a selection of biobased synthetic\nroutes to TMO from glucose, one of which included use of methyl levulinate\n(a byproduct of polyethylene furanoate production, Avantium).195 Each potential route was further analyzed by\na range of metric tools for comparison. 2,2,5,5-Tetramethyloxolane. TMO’s Kamlet–Taft parameters were\nmeasured and the\nHSP parameters calculated using HSPiP software. The Kamlet–Taft\nproperties showed that TMO had strong hydrogen bond accepting character\n(β = 0.77, Table 2) and a low polarity-polarizability character (π* = 0.35).\nAs per the other aprotic solvents, the hydrogen bond donating ability\nα was zero. In practice, however, the tetramethyl groups adjacent\nto the ether oxygen in TMO introduce significant steric bulk and essentially\nshield the lone-pairs, thus reducing their ability to accept hydrogen\nbonds. The effects of the steric hindrance are consistent with the\ncalculated HSP values, which show that TMO has a hydrogen bonding\nability (δH) of 2.1; for comparison, THF has a δH of 8.0,\nsee Table 2. The low\nδH value translates into real-world chemical reactivity effects.\nFor example, Byrne et al. have demonstrated that TMO is a poor solvent\nfor the formation of some Grignard reagents due to the poor accessibility\nof the oxygen lone-pairs (despite strong Lewis-acid characteristics).\nTMO was shown to behave more like hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene,\ngiving excellent rates of reaction in esterification and amidation\nreactions.103 TMO has also been assessed\nfor its potential as an extraction solvent in aqueous–organic\nextractions and was shown to be a particularly useful solvent in extracting\nhydrogen bond donating solutes from aqueous systems when toluene was\nnot.196 Pellis et al. have investigated\nthe use of TMO as an alternative solvent to toluene and THF in the\nbiocatalyzed polymerization of polyesters,197 and its resin swelling ability has been assessed by Yanrui et al.198 In a more niche use, TMO also performs effectively\nas a solvent for the oxidation of (hydroxymethyl)furfural to\ndiformylfuran.199 Eucalyptol is a naturally\noccurring bicyclic ether, see Figure 16, belonging to the monoterpenoid family, and is the\nmajor component of eucalyptus oil.200 The\nhigh-boiling liquid (176 °C) is insoluble in water and soluble\nin organic solvents including alcohols, ethers, and chloroform.201 Also known within the chemical literature as\n1,8-cineole, the oil is manufactured globally from tree species within\nthe Eucalyptus genus, with over 300 species known\nto contain the oil. These trees are commonly grown for the purpose\nof timber production, and the extraction of eucalyptol from the “waste\nleaf” from timber operations makes the source of the oil potentially\nsustainable.202 Pure eucalyptol is obtained\nfrom the “waste leaf” in a two-step process, distillation\nof harvested leaf with steam, followed by freezing of the crude material\nat −40 °C, with removal of unfrozen limonene impurities\n(usually 2–7%).202 Eucalyptol, like\na number of other dipolar aprotics solvents, is hygroscopic. The oil\nis known to have medicinal applications including potent anti-inflammatory\nand antioxidant properties.203 Because\nof its use as a medicine, in addition to a common food additive, eucalyptol\nhas been extensively tested and can be considered to have a low risk\nof toxicity.204 To date, very few publications\n(<10) have been reported using eucalyptol as a sustainable solvent\nfor organic transformations, although it has been shown to be an effective\nsolvent in applications such as transition-metal catalyzed C–C,\nC–O, C–N, and C–S bond formation205−207 in addition to carboxylations.208 Bicyclic\nether “eucalyptol”. Dimethyl\nisosorbide is a high boiling (235 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent,\nsee Figure 17, that\ncan be synthesized from biorenewable resources such as cellulose (in\ntwo steps via glucose and then sorbitol)209 or via direct methylation of platform molecule isosorbide.210−213 DMI has been assessed for its toxicity and mutagenicity and did\nnot display acute oral toxicity nor genotoxicity by Ames test.118 DMI was shown to be not readily biodegradable.118 DMI’s Kamlet–Taft properties\nshow that it possesses dipolarity/polarizability that is similar to\nDMF and DMAc; however, its hydrogen bond basicity is much less, and\nit is closer to acetone in that respect. Applications for DMI include\ngeneral synthesis as a replacement for traditional dipolar aprotic\nsolvents in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling,214 solid phase synthesis,215 and\nmembrane preparation.216 Uptake of DMI\nfor use in the personal care products industry has also been noted.217 A search of current literature using SciFinder218 shows that the uptake of DMI as a reaction\nsolvent is still quite low, with only 63 reported reactions in just\nfour publications.208,214,219,220 Dimethyl isosorbide:\na sorbitol derived dipolar aprotic solvent. Following a false start exploring whether N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone could offer advantages over the reprotoxic N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NEP was found to have reproductive\ntoxicity concerns),221N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone, see Figure 18, has been identified as a potential alternative to\nNMP due to its favorable characteristics: NBP is nonreproductively\ntoxic (according to OECD 414 test method), nonmutagenic (OECD 471),\nand also inherently biodegradable (OECD 302B).110 It is also possible to produce NBP from biorenewables.110 The apparent lack of reproductive toxicity\nmakes it an attractive alternative to NMP; however, NBP possesses\nacute oral toxicity that is greater than NMP so caution must still\nbe exercised when using this solvent. NBP resides in a similar solvent\nspace to other dipolar aprotic solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc,\nsee Table 2, and due\nto these similarities has been proposed as a somewhat safer “drop-in”\nalternative, though it should be noted the boiling point of NBP is\nsignificantly elevated at 241 °C, see Table 1, SN2 reaction kinetic experiments\nusing the Menschutkin reaction as a model reaction have shown that\nthe rate of reaction is highly dependent on the Kamlet–Taft\nparameter π* of the dipolar aprotic solvents screened; higher\nvalues lead to faster rates of reaction. NBP’s π* value\nof 0.77 is closest to acetonitrile’s of 0.75, and indeed the\nmost comparable rate of reaction experimentally observed for NBP was\nacetonitrile, seeFigure 19. NBP has also been examined for use as a drop-in replacement\nfor DMF in solid supported peptide synthesis.222 N-Butyl-2-pyrrolidone: a potential NMP\ndrop-in\nreplacement.

Methyl-5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate,\nsee Figure 20, otherwise\nknown commercially as Rhodiasolv PolarClean, is a clear, slightly\nyellow solvent. The nonvolatile liquid has a boiling point in the\nrange of 278–282 °C, a melting point of −60 °C,\nand a flash point of 144–146 °C. Similar to other dipolar\naprotic solvents, PolarClean is highly water miscible, with a solubility\nof greater than 490 g/L.223 It is reported\nthat the hygroscopicity of the solvent is very low, with water content\nvalues estimated between 0.00 and 0.10%, although some values up to\n0.30% have also been reported.223 Prior\nto increased use within synthetic chemistry, use as a crystal growth\ninhibitor in agrochemical formulations has been reported.224 A contributing factor to the sustainability\ncredentials of PolarClean arises from its production; it is produced\non an industrial scale from a byproduct of Nylon-66 manufacture, which\nwould otherwise be burnt for disposal.224 The production of PolarClean from this byproduct, methyleneglutarodinitrile\n(MDN), involves a multistep process. Starting from MDN, the route\nconsists of hydrogenation, hydration, cyclization, and subsequent\nring-opening with dimethylamine, followed by methylation of the remaining\ncarboxylic acid, see Scheme 3, yielding a mixture of two regioisomers.225 Further work has been described to redesign and improve\nthe synthetic route to PolarClean by Szekely and co-workers.104 Methyl-5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate:\nPolarClean. Similar in structure to PolarClean, a small number of diamide dipolar\naprotic solvents derived from succinic acid were reported by Byrne\nand co-workers in 2020.226 Designed to\nhave high dipolarity and low toxicity, the solvents were shown to\nperform effectively in the Heck cross-coupling reaction of iodobenzene\nand methyl acrylate in addition to potential uses in polymer solubilization\nand MOF synthesis.226 A novel\nclass of surfactant-based amphiphiles, including PS-750-M (also known\nas FI-750-M), polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS), d,l-α-tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycol\nsuccinate (TPGS-750-M), and SPGS-550-M (Nok), has recently emerged,\nwith the aim of facilitating efficient organic chemical reactions\nin water.227 When dissolved in water, the\nsurfactant amphiphilic molecules self-aggregate into micelles, with\nthe hydrophilic “head” interacting with the aqueous\nmedium, while the hydrophobic “tails” form an inner\n“lipophilic core”.227 The\nnanometer-sized particles formed during this aggregation process can\nbe thought of as nanoreactors, with localized pockets of high concentration\nreaction substrates, leading to rapid reaction rates.228 Use of these surfactants in an aqueous media\ncan allow significant reduction in the use of commonly used dipolar\naprotic solvents in reactions such as transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings,229 leading to a reduction of organic solvent waste\nstreams. When suitably optimized, these systems have been demonstrated,\noften on large scale,230 to lead to significant\nyield and selectivity improvements, reduced catalyst loadings,231 lower environmental footprints, and a general\nimprovement in productivity.232 Challenges\nassociated with the use of aqueous-surfactant systems include a lack\nof total generality (often a surfactant can be demonstrably compatible\nwith one class of reactions/starting materials and incompatible with\nanother), only an empirical/trial and error based understanding of\nreactions and why they work, mixing effects can be pronounced,233 preferential solubilization/dispersion of reagents\nversus products can affect reaction outcome,234 lack of in-house precedent/expertise to encourage the use of less\nmainstream reaction media, and extraction and isolation of products\nby conventional organic solvents. “Synthetic chemistry rules\nmost people learn are not universal. They apply to reactions in organic\nchemistry, but chemistry in water obeys different rules”;235 thus, discovering and learning these rules\nis an ongoing goal in the field. Many of the surfactants described\nin this section are commercially available at the time of writing,\nwhereas others are “designer”, that is, tailored specifically\nfor specific transformations. The aim of this section is to introduce\nthe reader to some of the cutting edge research in the field of organic\nsynthesis in aqueous-micellar systems. It also serves to demonstrate\nthat water does not have to be the enemy of the organic chemist but\na powerful ally.236 For further details,\nan excellent review discussing the challenges and opportunities faced\nby aqueous-micellar organic synthesis was published in 2021 in collaboration\nwith Novartis (Gallou et al.).237 PS-750-M, also known\nas FI-750-M, is a surfactant first described in 2017 in a publication\nby Handa et al. in collaboration with Novartis, for an aqueous media-based\npalladium-catalyzed coupling of nitroalkanes and aryl bromides.238 Derived from the naturally occurring amino\nacid l-proline, the surfactant can be prepared in a high-yielding\n4-step synthesis (overall 53% across 4 steps, Scheme 4). Since the initial publication, the surfactant\nhas been used to enable aqueous reactions including SNAr,239 α-arylations,240 fluorination of indoles,241 and Pd carbene-mediated\ninsertions.242 Polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS), see Scheme 5, is a first generation\nsurfactant to be shown to have utility in organic synthesis by Lipshutz\nand co-workers in 2008. Derived from the naturally occurring vitamin\nE307, α-tocopherol, PTS can be prepared by first condensing\nwith sebacoyl chloride, followed by dropwise addition of PEG-600,\nboth steps being carried out in the presence of triethylamine.243 Since first being described in organic synthesis\nas a surfactant, publications include Suzuki-Miyaura,244,245 Heck,246 Sonogashira,247 and Buchwald-Hartwig couplings,248 in addition to olefin metathesis.249,250 d,l-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycol\nsuccinate (TPGS-750-M), see Figure 21, is the second-generation variant of the amphiphile\nPTS, reported by Lipshutz and co-workers in 2011.55 Closely related to polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate\n(PTS), TPGS-750-M is again derived from the natural product α-tocopherol,\ndiffering in the carbon diacid and PEG chain link. Where PTS used\nthe 8 carbon acid linker sebacic acid, and PEG-600, TPGS has a shorter\n2-carbon diacid linker, in addition to the longer PEG-750-M chain.\nPreparation involves a similar sequence to that described for TPGS-750-M,\nwith sequential condensation of α-tocopherol with succinic anhydride\nin the presence of triethylamine, followed by PEG-750-M.55 In the publications disclosing the surfactant\namphiphile, its utility is shown in olefin metathesis, Suzuki-Miyaura,\nHeck, Sonogashira, Buchwald-Hartwig, Negishi, palladium catalyzed\nC–H activation, and palladium catalyzed allylations.55 A shortened, more stable version of this surfactant\nknown as TPG-Lite has also been developed in which the four carbon\nsuccinic acid linker is omitted. Reaction compatibility is broadly\nthat of TPGS-750M.251 d,l-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene\nglycol succinate also known as TPGS-750-M. In 2014, Lipshutz\net al. described a further enhancement to the previously designed\namphiphile surfactants, with a switch of the α-tocopherol to\nβ-sitosterol, see Figure 22. The resultant amphiphile, SPGS-550-M, otherwise known\nas “Nok”, was designed to be a more economically attractive\nsurfactant when compared with PTS and TPGS-750-M.229 Synthesis is similar to previous variants, with condensation\nof β-sitosterol with succinic anhydride, followed by further\nreaction with PEG-550-M.229 In the publication,\nthrough an extensive comparison process with TPGS-750-M, Nok was shown\nto perform as effectively as or more effectively than TPGS-750-M in\na range of reactions including metathesis, Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, Miyaura borylations, and Buchwald Hartwig aminations.229 Recent developments by the Lipshutz group have\nseen the invention of a low foaming surfactant known as “Coolade”.252 It is known that foaming can occur in surfactants\nthat possess long hydrophobic tails, the long tail leading to increased\nfoam volume and stability.252 Coolade does\nnot possess this tail, yet can still self-assemble into micelles.\nTypical reactions that suffered from foaming/frothing when conducted\nTPGS-750M, such as NaBH4 nitro reductions, were shown to\nbe free from foam when employing Coolade. Foam is generally seen as\nan inconvenience at best with larger reaction volumes and vessels\nrequired.252 Workup and product isolation\nmay also become complicated. Other reactions successfully demonstrated\nincluded double reduction of geminal dibromocyclopropanes, azide\nand sulfonyl azide reductions, and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. β-Sitosterol\nmethoxypolyethylene glycol succinate SPGS-550-M\n(Nok). In 2019, the DMSO inspired surfactant\n“MC-1” was\ndeveloped by Cortes-Clerget et al., and it is a designer surfactant\nthat specifically tailors to the needs of peptide chemistry, see Figure 23. The micelle accommodates\nboth amino acids/peptide starting materials and typical coupling reagents\nsuch as COMU in a polar yet still lipophilic environment.253 Multigram synthesis of dipeptides was successfully\nconducted in high yields (>90%) using this surfactant. MC-1, a designer\nsurfactant successfully used for peptide coupling\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions. Nonionic designer surfactant stearyl methoxyPEGglycol succinate\n(SMPS) was designed and successfully implemented in nitro-arene reduction\nand tethered indole synthesis by Kothandapani et al., see Figure 24(254) Apart from high yielding synthesis of the target substrates\nin this SMPS-water system, a preliminary toxicity screen was also\nconducted, which included phytotoxicity, bacterial toxicity, and aquatic\ntoxicity. It was shown at the concentrations screened that seed growth\nwas not affected compared to controls nor were there significant bacterial\ntoxicity effects or harmful effects toward zebrafish during the aquatic\ntoxicity screening.254 The surfactant design\nconcept used here was structured around the “Benign by Design”\nprinciple central to green chemistry.255 Designer surfactant SMPS used for Zn mediated nitro-arene reduction\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions.254 Utilizing surfactants in organic chemistry can\nbe challenging and\noften lack generality when it comes to surfactant choice, that is,\nthere is no one universal surfactant. Often, starting material solubility\nis problematic, and organic cosolvents have been utilized to change\nthe nature and dynamics of the emulsions formed. One particularly\nproblem was assessed by Sanzone et al. for the synthesis of rigid\nand poorly soluble organic semiconductor molecules.256 It was hypothesized that by increasing the aromatic content\nof the hydrophobic portion of the surfactant, additional π–π\ninteractions could be facilitated between the surfactant and reaction\nstarting materials. Thus, successful dispersion of starting materials\nthat exhibit self-aggregation due to π–π interactions\nwith themselves could be achieved. The surfactant designed, PiNAP-750M,\nsee Figure 25, allowed\nfor the generation of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling products at room\ntemperature, without cosolvent, and in short reaction times (of 10\nmin), see Scheme 6.\nReaction times were much slower when conducted in commercially available\nsurfactants such as K-EL (hours to days longer). E-factors were also\ndemonstrated to be up to an order of magnitude lower than the currently\npublished synthetic routes utilizing organic solvents when using the\nPiNAP-750M system.256 Designer surfactant\nPiNAP-750M exhibiting additional aromatic conjugation\nin the hydrophobic region.256 Designer surfactants can also be prepared from biorenewable materials,\nsuch as the synthesis of APGS-550-M from resin acids (from rosin)\nsuch as abietic acid, see Figure 26. The surfactant, prepared by Yang et al., was shown\nto be highly effective in facilitating Cu-mediated amidation of alkynyl\nbromides under aqueous-micellar conditions, see Scheme 7.257 Normally,\nthis type of transformation is conducted in dry solvents such as DMF,\nDMSO, or toluene at elevated temperatures. Side-reactions that can\noccur include homocoupling of alkynes to give 1,3-diynes, hydration\nof the diynes to furans, and hydration of ynamides to amides;257 thus, the presence of water in the system is\nsomewhat counterintuitive. However, the micellar conditions allow\nfor smooth conversion of bromoalkynes to the corresponding ynamides.\nA variety of alkyl and aryl groups were tolerated under the conditions\nand electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as amides, p-toluenesulfonamides, N-phenyl methanesulfonamides, oxazolidinones, and N-phenyl methanesulfonamides were all compatible with\nthis methodology showing broad functional group tolerance for this\ntype of transformation. Finally, the reaction medium was shown to\nbe recyclable as long as additional copper was added, and by the third\nrun using recycled medium, the reaction E-factor was as low as 5. APGS-550-M,\nprepared from potential biorenewable sources such as\nrosin and succinic acid. Chen et al. have also sought\nto exploit rosin as a potential source\nof raw materials for the synthesis of surfactants, see Figure 27.258 DAPGS-750-M is structurally related to APGS-550-M in that it is\nalso derived from abietic acid. Aqueous-micellar conditions using\nthis surfactant have allowed for β-scission of −CH3 from a range of aromatic tertiary alcohols to give corresponding\nketones. The same reaction conducted in traditional organic solvents,\nbinary aqueous–organic mixtures, and aqueous-micellar conditions\nsuch as TPGS-750-M, gave poor yields, see Scheme 8. One potential reason for this is due to\nthe different shape, size, and distribution of the DAPGS micelles\nwhen compared to other surfactants examined in this publication.258 A variety of acetophenone-like molecules were\nprepared from the corresponding tertiary alcohols in moderate to excellent\nyields, though anilines were not tolerated at all. Furthermore, bulky\nβ-carbon groups were preferentially eliminated in preference\nof methyl groups. In-flask recycling of the aqueous-micellar system\nwas also demonstrated with an E-factor of 11 observed after three\nruns. DAPGS-750M, a dehydroabietinol-derived surfactant.\n\n## Cyrene\nCyrene, or dihydrolevoglucosenone,\nsee Figure 6, is a\ndipolar aprotic solvent that was designed as a potential alternative\nto common REACH-restricted solvents such as NMP and DMF.80 It is produced from renewable resources (accessed\nfrom cellulose in two steps, Scheme 1), can be considered as readily biodegradable, possesses\nlow acute oral toxicity, and has not demonstrated mutagenicity by\nAmes testing. Ocular irritation has however been reported.118 The Kamlet–Taft and HSP parameters for\nCyrene were calculated, and it was shown to occupy a similar Hansen\nsolvent space to NMP, see Table 2.80 HSP: van der Waals forces (δD),\npolarity (δP), and hydrogen bonding (δH). Kamlet–Taft:\nDipolarity/polarizability (π*), hydrogen-bonding acidity (donor)\n(α), and hydrogen-bonding basicity (acceptor) (β). Solvent\nordered by empirical solvent polarity, as in Table 1. Bio-based solvent\n“Cyrene”. Cyrene has been successfully employed as a solvent in multiple\ntransformations including palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions,14 acid chloride and amide synthesis,119,120 urea synthesis,121 MOF synthesis,122 and fabrication of water filtration membranes.123,124 For a review of Cyrene production and utilization, see Camp et al.125 The solubility of solutes in Cyrene has been\nshown to be dependent on the water content of Cyrene.126 An equilibrium between Cyrene’s ketone\nand a geminal diol form exists. Maximum solubility of solutes was\nfound to be associated with the presence of the diol form. These observations\nhave further led Cyrene to be considered as a solvent with potentially\ntunable or switchable properties.126 The\nuse of Cyrene with bases however must be appropriately considered\nas a number of inorganic bases react with Cyrene, catalyzing aldol\naddition. Furthermore, amines can react with Cyrene if heated, although\ntriethylamine at 30 °C has been found to be tolerated.127\n\n## Cygnet Solvents\nThe Cygnet class\nof solvents, Figure 7, refers to functionalized, ketal-protected variants of the previously\ndiscussed Cyrene.66 These derivatives are\nmore stable than the unprotected ketone Cyrene, and were purposely\ndesigned to act as more inert forms of the original solvent, given\nthat the ketone can be unstable under acidic conditions. The simplest\nCygnet variant, Cygnet 0.0, is functionalized such that the ketone\nis protected with ethylene glycol, with the higher variants protected\nwith derivatized ethylene glycol variants.128 Cyrene\nderived “Cygnet” family of solvents. Each variation can be prepared by condensation of the corresponding\ndiol with Cyrene in the presence of an acid clay catalyst, liberating\nonly water as a byproduct.66 Five variants\nof Cygnet have been synthesized to date, with their nomenclature based\non the number of carbon atoms in the chain attached to each of the\ntwo ketal carbon atoms (e.g., Cygnet 1.1 contains 1 carbon atom, a\nmethyl group, attached to each carbon of ethylene glycol). Because\nof the increased molecular weight of Cygnet derivatives compared with\nCyrene, the melting point of each solvent (e.g., for Cygnet 0.0, >\n70 °C) can lead to more difficult handling as a solvent. Of particular\ninterest is the use of Cygnet 0.0 as a solvent, given that the predicted\nHansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) place it in a similar part of Hansen\nSolubility Space as dichloromethane (DCM); however, alternatives\nto chlorinated solvents were the focus of a recent review by some\nof the authors of this work and are not covered here.8,66 To date, Cygnet 0.0 has been screened as a potential green solvent\nfor dissolution of polymers for NIPS membrane casting.128 Toxicity and mutagenicity testing is underway\nfor Cygnet 0.0, although Cygnet variants are predicted to be nontoxic\nand nonmutagenic.66 Cygnet 0.0 and Cyrene\nblends have been successfully utilized in the biocatalytic synthesis\nof polyesters, effectively replacing traditionally employed polar\naprotic solvents.129\n\n## Carbonates and Cyclic Carbonates\nCarbonate-based solvents\ncount dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl\ncarbonate, ethylene carbonate, and propylene carbonate, see Figure 8, among the most\npopular and widely used exemplars. Of the aforementioned solvents,\npropylene and ethylene carbonate score most favorably according to\nthe GSK solvent selection guide,44 though\ntheir elevated boiling points (242 and 248 °C, respectively)\nmay preclude their use in some applications. Depending on the polarity\nof the product, partitioning of high boiling solvents into an aqueous\nlayer followed by product extraction with an immiscible nonpolar solvent\ncan be achieved.2 However, this additional\nstep inevitably increases process mass intensity and waste generation\nvia the introduction of an additional solvent. Propylene carbonate\nsynthesis and production have been discussed by Forero et al. in their\nreview of propylene carbonate as a green solvent;130 multiple methods utilize CO2 as a carbon source\nin conjunction with other potentially renewable starting materials.\nPropylene carbonate occupies a Hansen solvent space close to acetonitrile,\nsee Table 2, giving\na rough indication of comparable solvating ability. Potential applications\nfor carbonate based solvents include, but are not limited to, metal\ncatalyzed cross-coupling reactions,107 proline-catalyzed\naldol reactions,131 hydrosilylation,132 cyanohydrin synthesis,133 proline-catalyzed hydrazination,134 amine-electrophile SN2 chemistry,135 and the Appel reaction.136 Some commonly\nemployed carbonate-based solvents.\n\n## γ-Valerolactone (GVL)\nγ-Valerolactone,\nsee Figure 9, is a\nhigh boiling (207 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent and platform molecule137 that can be isolated from lignocellulosic biomass\nvia levulinic acid.138 Multiple reviews\nand methods of its production have been published; 128 patents mention\nGVL, and it is present as a product in 567 separate publications.139 GVL has enjoyed moderate uptake as a reaction\nsolvent across a wide variety of chemistry types. A search conducted\nusing SciFinder shows that GVL has been employed as reaction solvent\nin 750 reactions across 108 publications, more than three-quarters\nof which have been published since 2014.140 Applications of this solvent as a reaction medium including palladium-catalyzed\ncross-coupling,141 electrochemistry,142 lignin depolymerization,143 C–H activation chemistry,144 and solid phase peptide synthesis.145 The success and wide variety of applications in which GVL has been\nemployed are in part due to GVL’s favorable solvent properties;\nKamlet–Taft parameters are comparable to DMF and DMAc and COSMO-RS\nmodeling, and HSP comparisons have shown GVL to be most similar to\nacetone, NMP, DMF, and DMAc.146 Biodegradation\nstudies have shown GVL to rapidly and completely break down in aquatic\nenvironments, and it has been demonstrated to be less toxic to humans\nthat comparable dipolar aprotic solvents.146 Caution however must be taken when utilizing GVL as it is a known\nprodrug for γ-hydroxyvaleric acid (GHV), which itself has been\nnoted as an alternative for UK Class C drug γ-hydroxybutyric\nacid (GHB),147 possession of which is punishable\nby up to 2 years imprisonment. Therefore, it is the authors suggestion\nthat use and inventory/storage of this solvent be treated with caution\ndue to its sedative properties, potential for abuse, and potential\nfor future legislative restriction. Furthermore, due to the aforementioned\nconcerns, the authors have opted not to recommend GVL as a replacement\nsolvent in the condensed solvent selection guide provided in the Supporting Information (Unified Solvent Selection\nGuide for Dipolar Aprotic Solvents). γ-Valerolactone.\n\n## Sulfolane\nSulfolane, see Figure 10, is a high-boiling\n(285 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent developed by Shell, and it has\nseen use in industrial applications in gas and oil refining, for example,\nthe Sulfinol Process.148 Sulfolane can\nbe produced industrially via the reaction of SO2 with butadiene\nfollowed by hydrogenation of the intermediate sulfolene to give sulfolane.149 HSP values for sulfolane suggest that is has\nvery high solubilizing power for polar compounds, similar to DMSO,\nsee Table 2. Sulfolane\nalso possesses one of the highest Kamlet–Taft polarizability/dipolarity\nscores (π* = 0.90) of any of the solvents in Table 2, only DMSO is higher at 1.00.\nSulfolane’s hydrogen bond basicity β is much lower however\nat 0.39 compared to DMSO 0.76 and is closer to propylene carbonate\nin this parameter (π* = 0.90, β = 0.38). Sulfolane is\nimmiscible with alkanes and MTBE, which can allow for facile workups\nand product extraction of MTBE soluble products.149 Sulfolane has previously been considered as a safer dipolar\naprotic solvent including for the fact that sulfolane has a much lower\nskin permeability than DMSO, DMF, DMAc, and NMP.149 Sulfolane, however, has been identified as potentially\nmore hazardous than originally thought. A study on the reproductive\ntoxicity effects of sulfolane in rats has suggested that the solvent\ncould harm unborn child.150 Some SDS now\ncarry a H360 warning to reflect this evidence.151 Furthermore, sulfolane has been recategorized according\nto the Chem21 solvent selection guide from “recommended”\nto “hazardous”.43 Sulfolane\ncontamination of groundwater and drinking water was reported near\nthe oil refinery in the community of Fairbanks, Alaska.152 Thus, it is the authors’ recommendation\nthat sulfolane is not considered as a suitable green solvent. For\na review of reactions conducted using sulfolane, see Tilstam et al.149 Sulfolane.\n\n## 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF)\n2-Methyltetrahydrofuran, see Figure 11, is an ethereal solvent that can be derived\nfrom renewable resources such as levulinic acid or furfural,153 which can themselves be derived from agricultural\nwaste such as corn stover, sugar cane bagasse, and rice straw.154 Life cycle assessment conducted on 2-MeTHF\nhas shown that production of the solvent from furfural derived from\ncorn-cob waste can reduce emissions by up to 97% when compared to\na traditional chemical synthesis of THF,155 though it is not always clear how individual supplies of 2-MeTHF\nare currently made. Structurally, 2-MeTHF differs from THF by the\naddition of one single methyl group, yet this addition is responsible\nfor several significantly different physiochemical properties. First,\nthe boiling point is elevated by 13 °C, see Table 1. 2-MeTHF is significantly less\nmiscible with water at room temperature (129.2 g/L)156 than THF (494.7 g/L).157 This\nimmiscibility has led 2-MeTHF to be employed as an extraction solvent\nand also as an organic component in aqueous–organic biphasic\nreaction mixtures.158 Interestingly, 2-MeTHF\nis also inversely soluble in water; at 0 °C, 2-MeTHF is 21 wt\n% soluble in water, whereas at 19 °C, this is reduced to 14 wt\n% and at 50 °C it is just 7.8 wt %.159 2-MeTHF is also more stable to acidic hydrolysis than THF and has\na longer t1/2 for R-Li mediated decomposition\nwhen compared to THF (130 min vs 10 min at 35 °C),158 though it is still susceptible to peroxide\nformation.160 As 2-MeTHF occupies a very\nsimilar solvent space to THF, see Table 2, it has been promoted as a “drop-in”\nreplacement for THF that is greener and more sustainable. A number\nof reagent solutions are now commercially available in 2-MeTHF such\nas Grignard and lithium reagents,161 further\npromoting their uptake as viable alternatives to THF and diethyl ether.153 Use of 2-MeTHF has seen gradual increase as\nnoted in the solvent use survey conducted by Ashcroft et al. (14%\nof publications in OPR&D for the period of 2009–2012 utilized\n2-MeTHF in some stage of the reported synthesis).9 Many reviews of solvents ignore price, as such information\ncan vary greatly depending on geography, purchasing contracts, or\ntime. However, it is instructive to note that a price comparison of\n2-MeTHF and THF was conducted in 2021 using Sigma-Aldrich’s\nwebsite, see Table 3. Search criteria used were anhydrous solvents containing 250 ppm\nbutylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) inhibitor and a purity of ≥99.9%.\nCost per liter of 2-MeTHF is nearly 2.5-times greater than standard\nTHF at the purity and grade that were considered. However, economies\nof scale come into effect at 200 L drum size; 2-MeTHF was only 13%\nmore expensive than THF. Depending on the details of the reaction\nconcerned, it is therefore easily conceivable that the increased cost\nof purchase could be offset by other reduced costs (e.g., less aqueous\nwaste for incineration). For further reviews of 2-MeTHF use, see Pace\net al. 2012,153 Monticelli et al. 2017,160 and most recently Bijoy et al. 2021.162 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran.\n\n## Cyclopentyl\nMethyl Ether (CPME)\nCyclopentyl\nmethyl ether, see Figure 12, is a hydrophobic ethereal solvent with a high boiling point\n(106 °C), see Table 1. It became a credible alternative to many ethereal solvents,\nsuch as THF and 1,4-dioxane, when commercial quantities became available\nin 2005.165 CPME can be produced from either\ncyclopentanol or from cyclopentene, see Scheme 2.165 The similar\nHSP parameters of CPME to other ethereal solvents (and their proximity\nto one another in Hansen space), such as 1,4-dioxane and THF, give\nan indication that CPME likely possesses similar solubilizing capabilities,80 see Table 2. CPME can be made from renewable resources, although\nit is not currently commercially available via a biobased route, and\noffers other benefits, including significantly safer handling and\nrelative stability under acidic and basic conditions.165 Peroxide formation is still an issue however,\nand butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is still required as an additive\nto prevent oxidation.165,103,166 Toxicological assessment of CPME was conducted by Watanabe et al.\nin 2013, and it was shown to have relatively low acute toxicity, and\nwas shown not to be a skin sensitizer nor a mutagen. Eye and skin\nirritation were however observed.167 The\npotential for this solvent to become a solvent for use in process\nchemistry was reviewed in 2007165 and more\nrecently in 2019168 where its position\nas a more sustainable, environmentally friendly ether has become reinforced.\nApplications where it has been successfully employed include organometallic\nchemistry, transition metal catalysis, acid catalysis, amidation reactions,\noxidations, radical reactions, and as an organic phase in biphasic\nchemistry.168 For specific examples, see\nreviews by Azzena et al.,168 Watanabe et\nal.,165 and most recently Bijoy et al.162 Cyclopentyl methyl ether.\n\n## Methyl \nMethyl tert-butyl ether\n(MTBE), see Figure 13, sometimes referred\nto as tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME), is a volatile\n(bp 55 °C), flammable, colorless liquid that is commonly used\nas a fuel additive to reduce detonation risk in addition to reducing\nunwanted emissions.169 Similar to other\nethers, MTBE is often used in the place of THF and diethyl ether due\nto its significantly lower risk of peroxide formation, with the tert-butyl group thought to contribute to this.170 In comparison with other ethereal solvents,\nMTBE does, however, have a much lower flash point (−28 °C,\ncompared with −14.5 °C for THF and −1 °C for\nCPME), see Table 4.166 Furthermore, there have been some health concerns\nrelated to MTBE, with links to endocrine disruption.172 MTBE is synthesized industrially in a similar way to CPME,\nthrough the reaction of methanol (derived from natural gas), and isobutylene,\nsourced from the dehydrogenation of isobutane.173 Methyl tert-butyl ether. MTBE has\nbeen used as a solvent in reaction classes including C–H\nborylations,174 Suzuki-Miyaura couplings,174 palladium-catalyzed silyl enolate alkylations,\nand Sonogashira cross-couplings.175 It\nhas additionally been known to be used as an alternative greener solvent\nin normal-phase column chromatography,176 and as an alternative extraction solvent due to its immiscibility\nwith water.177 Unlike other ethers, the\nlow Lewis basicity of MTBE results in incompatibility with formation\nof Grignard reagents and limits use in lithiations.\n\n## Cyclic Ketones: Cyclohexanone and Cyclopentanone\nBoth\ncyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, see Figure 14, have been promoted as alternative dipolar\naprotic ketone solvent replacements that can be potentially produced\nfrom biorenewable resources.178 Cyclopentanone\ncan be produced from the biobased platform molecule furfural,179 and cyclohexanone by catalytic reduction of\naromatic ethers such as anisole.180 Both\nsolvents score highly according to the GSK solvent selection guide\nas potentially greener and more sustainable ketone solvents for myriad\nreasons including favorable recyclability scoring, minimal known measured\naquatic impact, moderate to good exposure and health hazard scoring,\nand a good reactivity and flammability score.44 Both cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone have boiling points that are\nelevated (cyclopentanone 129 °C, cyclohexanone 155 °C (Table 1) and occupy a similar\nHansen solubility space to each other when comparing δD and\nδH. However, the polarity parameter or δP differs significantly;\ncyclopentanone is 11.9, whereas cyclohexanone is 8.4, see Table 2, suggesting that\ncyclopentanone is more polar than cyclohexanone. This is at odds with\nthe Reichardt polarity parameter (0.281 vs 0.269, Table 1). When examining the Kamlet–Taft\nparameters, cyclopentanone possesses a larger π* (0.76 vs 0.68)\nand both solvents have nearly identical hydrogen bond basicity β\nof (0.52 and 0.53). π* as a measure of dipolarity/polarizability\nis in agreement with the information provided by the HSP parameters;\ncyclopentanone is “more polar” by this measure than\ncyclohexanone. Cyclopentanone has been successfully employed as solvent\nin several processes. A SciFinder analysis of the literature shows\nthat 74 nonparticipating single-step transformations have been reported\nin 29 different journal publications.181 Uses include solvent in photoredox catalysis,182 aldol reactions (as both solvent and reagent),183 and solvent for Steglich-type thioester formation,184 transition metal catalysis,185 and total synthesis.186 Similarly,\ncyclohexanone has seen use in 1545 reactions in 421 journal publications.187 Uses include transition metal catalysis,188,189 aldol reactions,190 total synthesis,191 and as a general synthesis solvent in medicinal\nchemistry drug discovery.192 Aside from\ntheir use as solvents, both cyclic ketones have found significant\nuse as organic chemistry building-blocks; cyclohexanone is an important\nprecursor for Nylon-6.193 Cyclic ketones cyclopentanone\n(left) and cyclohexanone (right).\n\n## 2,2,5,5-Tetramethyloxolane (TMO)\nTMO or 2,2,5,5-tetramethyltetrahydrofuran (TMTHF), see Figure 15, is a volatile\nnonpolar (VNP) ether that was identified as a potential replacement\nfor volatile and peroxide forming ethers and also toluene as part\nof the ReSolve project.194 Specific properties\nof a boiling point of <115 °C and nonperoxide forming characteristics\nwere required, and TMO fulfilled these criteria (bp 112 °C, Table 1) from a selection\nof other quaternary alpha-carbon ether hydrocarbons that were considered.103 TMO can be synthesized from 2,5-dimethylhexane-2,5-diol\n(which itself can be potentially produced from renewable resources)\nvia a dehydration reaction.103 Additionally,\na recent report by Byrne et al. compared a selection of biobased synthetic\nroutes to TMO from glucose, one of which included use of methyl levulinate\n(a byproduct of polyethylene furanoate production, Avantium).195 Each potential route was further analyzed by\na range of metric tools for comparison. 2,2,5,5-Tetramethyloxolane. TMO’s Kamlet–Taft parameters were\nmeasured and the\nHSP parameters calculated using HSPiP software. The Kamlet–Taft\nproperties showed that TMO had strong hydrogen bond accepting character\n(β = 0.77, Table 2) and a low polarity-polarizability character (π* = 0.35).\nAs per the other aprotic solvents, the hydrogen bond donating ability\nα was zero. In practice, however, the tetramethyl groups adjacent\nto the ether oxygen in TMO introduce significant steric bulk and essentially\nshield the lone-pairs, thus reducing their ability to accept hydrogen\nbonds. The effects of the steric hindrance are consistent with the\ncalculated HSP values, which show that TMO has a hydrogen bonding\nability (δH) of 2.1; for comparison, THF has a δH of 8.0,\nsee Table 2. The low\nδH value translates into real-world chemical reactivity effects.\nFor example, Byrne et al. have demonstrated that TMO is a poor solvent\nfor the formation of some Grignard reagents due to the poor accessibility\nof the oxygen lone-pairs (despite strong Lewis-acid characteristics).\nTMO was shown to behave more like hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene,\ngiving excellent rates of reaction in esterification and amidation\nreactions.103 TMO has also been assessed\nfor its potential as an extraction solvent in aqueous–organic\nextractions and was shown to be a particularly useful solvent in extracting\nhydrogen bond donating solutes from aqueous systems when toluene was\nnot.196 Pellis et al. have investigated\nthe use of TMO as an alternative solvent to toluene and THF in the\nbiocatalyzed polymerization of polyesters,197 and its resin swelling ability has been assessed by Yanrui et al.198 In a more niche use, TMO also performs effectively\nas a solvent for the oxidation of (hydroxymethyl)furfural to\ndiformylfuran.199\n\n## Eucalyptol\nEucalyptol is a naturally\noccurring bicyclic ether, see Figure 16, belonging to the monoterpenoid family, and is the\nmajor component of eucalyptus oil.200 The\nhigh-boiling liquid (176 °C) is insoluble in water and soluble\nin organic solvents including alcohols, ethers, and chloroform.201 Also known within the chemical literature as\n1,8-cineole, the oil is manufactured globally from tree species within\nthe Eucalyptus genus, with over 300 species known\nto contain the oil. These trees are commonly grown for the purpose\nof timber production, and the extraction of eucalyptol from the “waste\nleaf” from timber operations makes the source of the oil potentially\nsustainable.202 Pure eucalyptol is obtained\nfrom the “waste leaf” in a two-step process, distillation\nof harvested leaf with steam, followed by freezing of the crude material\nat −40 °C, with removal of unfrozen limonene impurities\n(usually 2–7%).202 Eucalyptol, like\na number of other dipolar aprotics solvents, is hygroscopic. The oil\nis known to have medicinal applications including potent anti-inflammatory\nand antioxidant properties.203 Because\nof its use as a medicine, in addition to a common food additive, eucalyptol\nhas been extensively tested and can be considered to have a low risk\nof toxicity.204 To date, very few publications\n(<10) have been reported using eucalyptol as a sustainable solvent\nfor organic transformations, although it has been shown to be an effective\nsolvent in applications such as transition-metal catalyzed C–C,\nC–O, C–N, and C–S bond formation205−207 in addition to carboxylations.208 Bicyclic\nether “eucalyptol”.\n\n## Dimethyl Isosorbide (DMI)\nDimethyl\nisosorbide is a high boiling (235 °C) dipolar aprotic solvent,\nsee Figure 17, that\ncan be synthesized from biorenewable resources such as cellulose (in\ntwo steps via glucose and then sorbitol)209 or via direct methylation of platform molecule isosorbide.210−213 DMI has been assessed for its toxicity and mutagenicity and did\nnot display acute oral toxicity nor genotoxicity by Ames test.118 DMI was shown to be not readily biodegradable.118 DMI’s Kamlet–Taft properties\nshow that it possesses dipolarity/polarizability that is similar to\nDMF and DMAc; however, its hydrogen bond basicity is much less, and\nit is closer to acetone in that respect. Applications for DMI include\ngeneral synthesis as a replacement for traditional dipolar aprotic\nsolvents in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling,214 solid phase synthesis,215 and\nmembrane preparation.216 Uptake of DMI\nfor use in the personal care products industry has also been noted.217 A search of current literature using SciFinder218 shows that the uptake of DMI as a reaction\nsolvent is still quite low, with only 63 reported reactions in just\nfour publications.208,214,219,220 Dimethyl isosorbide:\na sorbitol derived dipolar aprotic solvent.\n\n## None\nFollowing a false start exploring whether N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone could offer advantages over the reprotoxic N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NEP was found to have reproductive\ntoxicity concerns),221N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone, see Figure 18, has been identified as a potential alternative to\nNMP due to its favorable characteristics: NBP is nonreproductively\ntoxic (according to OECD 414 test method), nonmutagenic (OECD 471),\nand also inherently biodegradable (OECD 302B).110 It is also possible to produce NBP from biorenewables.110 The apparent lack of reproductive toxicity\nmakes it an attractive alternative to NMP; however, NBP possesses\nacute oral toxicity that is greater than NMP so caution must still\nbe exercised when using this solvent. NBP resides in a similar solvent\nspace to other dipolar aprotic solvents such as NMP, DMF, and DMAc,\nsee Table 2, and due\nto these similarities has been proposed as a somewhat safer “drop-in”\nalternative, though it should be noted the boiling point of NBP is\nsignificantly elevated at 241 °C, see Table 1, SN2 reaction kinetic experiments\nusing the Menschutkin reaction as a model reaction have shown that\nthe rate of reaction is highly dependent on the Kamlet–Taft\nparameter π* of the dipolar aprotic solvents screened; higher\nvalues lead to faster rates of reaction. NBP’s π* value\nof 0.77 is closest to acetonitrile’s of 0.75, and indeed the\nmost comparable rate of reaction experimentally observed for NBP was\nacetonitrile, seeFigure 19. NBP has also been examined for use as a drop-in replacement\nfor DMF in solid supported peptide synthesis.222 N-Butyl-2-pyrrolidone: a potential NMP\ndrop-in\nreplacement.

The nonvolatile liquid has a boiling point in the\nrange of 278–282 °C, a melting point of −60 °C,\nand a flash point of 144–146 °C. Similar to other dipolar\naprotic solvents, PolarClean is highly water miscible, with a solubility\nof greater than 490 g/L.223 It is reported\nthat the hygroscopicity of the solvent is very low, with water content\nvalues estimated between 0.00 and 0.10%, although some values up to\n0.30% have also been reported.223 Prior\nto increased use within synthetic chemistry, use as a crystal growth\ninhibitor in agrochemical formulations has been reported.224 A contributing factor to the sustainability\ncredentials of PolarClean arises from its production; it is produced\non an industrial scale from a byproduct of Nylon-66 manufacture, which\nwould otherwise be burnt for disposal.224 The production of PolarClean from this byproduct, methyleneglutarodinitrile\n(MDN), involves a multistep process. Starting from MDN, the route\nconsists of hydrogenation, hydration, cyclization, and subsequent\nring-opening with dimethylamine, followed by methylation of the remaining\ncarboxylic acid, see Scheme 3, yielding a mixture of two regioisomers.225 Further work has been described to redesign and improve\nthe synthetic route to PolarClean by Szekely and co-workers.104 Methyl-5-(dimethylamino)-2-methyl-5-oxopentanoate:\nPolarClean. Similar in structure to PolarClean, a small number of diamide dipolar\naprotic solvents derived from succinic acid were reported by Byrne\nand co-workers in 2020.226 Designed to\nhave high dipolarity and low toxicity, the solvents were shown to\nperform effectively in the Heck cross-coupling reaction of iodobenzene\nand methyl acrylate in addition to potential uses in polymer solubilization\nand MOF synthesis.226\n\n## Surfactant-Based Amphiphiles\nA novel\nclass of surfactant-based amphiphiles, including PS-750-M (also known\nas FI-750-M), polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS), d,l-α-tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycol\nsuccinate (TPGS-750-M), and SPGS-550-M (Nok), has recently emerged,\nwith the aim of facilitating efficient organic chemical reactions\nin water.227 When dissolved in water, the\nsurfactant amphiphilic molecules self-aggregate into micelles, with\nthe hydrophilic “head” interacting with the aqueous\nmedium, while the hydrophobic “tails” form an inner\n“lipophilic core”.227 The\nnanometer-sized particles formed during this aggregation process can\nbe thought of as nanoreactors, with localized pockets of high concentration\nreaction substrates, leading to rapid reaction rates.228 Use of these surfactants in an aqueous media\ncan allow significant reduction in the use of commonly used dipolar\naprotic solvents in reactions such as transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings,229 leading to a reduction of organic solvent waste\nstreams. When suitably optimized, these systems have been demonstrated,\noften on large scale,230 to lead to significant\nyield and selectivity improvements, reduced catalyst loadings,231 lower environmental footprints, and a general\nimprovement in productivity.232 Challenges\nassociated with the use of aqueous-surfactant systems include a lack\nof total generality (often a surfactant can be demonstrably compatible\nwith one class of reactions/starting materials and incompatible with\nanother), only an empirical/trial and error based understanding of\nreactions and why they work, mixing effects can be pronounced,233 preferential solubilization/dispersion of reagents\nversus products can affect reaction outcome,234 lack of in-house precedent/expertise to encourage the use of less\nmainstream reaction media, and extraction and isolation of products\nby conventional organic solvents. “Synthetic chemistry rules\nmost people learn are not universal. They apply to reactions in organic\nchemistry, but chemistry in water obeys different rules”;235 thus, discovering and learning these rules\nis an ongoing goal in the field. Many of the surfactants described\nin this section are commercially available at the time of writing,\nwhereas others are “designer”, that is, tailored specifically\nfor specific transformations. The aim of this section is to introduce\nthe reader to some of the cutting edge research in the field of organic\nsynthesis in aqueous-micellar systems. It also serves to demonstrate\nthat water does not have to be the enemy of the organic chemist but\na powerful ally.236 For further details,\nan excellent review discussing the challenges and opportunities faced\nby aqueous-micellar organic synthesis was published in 2021 in collaboration\nwith Novartis (Gallou et al.).237 PS-750-M, also known\nas FI-750-M, is a surfactant first described in 2017 in a publication\nby Handa et al. in collaboration with Novartis, for an aqueous media-based\npalladium-catalyzed coupling of nitroalkanes and aryl bromides.238 Derived from the naturally occurring amino\nacid l-proline, the surfactant can be prepared in a high-yielding\n4-step synthesis (overall 53% across 4 steps, Scheme 4). Since the initial publication, the surfactant\nhas been used to enable aqueous reactions including SNAr,239 α-arylations,240 fluorination of indoles,241 and Pd carbene-mediated\ninsertions.242 Polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate (PTS), see Scheme 5, is a first generation\nsurfactant to be shown to have utility in organic synthesis by Lipshutz\nand co-workers in 2008. Derived from the naturally occurring vitamin\nE307, α-tocopherol, PTS can be prepared by first condensing\nwith sebacoyl chloride, followed by dropwise addition of PEG-600,\nboth steps being carried out in the presence of triethylamine.243 Since first being described in organic synthesis\nas a surfactant, publications include Suzuki-Miyaura,244,245 Heck,246 Sonogashira,247 and Buchwald-Hartwig couplings,248 in addition to olefin metathesis.249,250 d,l-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene glycol\nsuccinate (TPGS-750-M), see Figure 21, is the second-generation variant of the amphiphile\nPTS, reported by Lipshutz and co-workers in 2011.55 Closely related to polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate\n(PTS), TPGS-750-M is again derived from the natural product α-tocopherol,\ndiffering in the carbon diacid and PEG chain link. Where PTS used\nthe 8 carbon acid linker sebacic acid, and PEG-600, TPGS has a shorter\n2-carbon diacid linker, in addition to the longer PEG-750-M chain.\nPreparation involves a similar sequence to that described for TPGS-750-M,\nwith sequential condensation of α-tocopherol with succinic anhydride\nin the presence of triethylamine, followed by PEG-750-M.55 In the publications disclosing the surfactant\namphiphile, its utility is shown in olefin metathesis, Suzuki-Miyaura,\nHeck, Sonogashira, Buchwald-Hartwig, Negishi, palladium catalyzed\nC–H activation, and palladium catalyzed allylations.55 A shortened, more stable version of this surfactant\nknown as TPG-Lite has also been developed in which the four carbon\nsuccinic acid linker is omitted. Reaction compatibility is broadly\nthat of TPGS-750M.251 d,l-α-Tocopherol methoxypolyethylene\nglycol succinate also known as TPGS-750-M. In 2014, Lipshutz\net al. described a further enhancement to the previously designed\namphiphile surfactants, with a switch of the α-tocopherol to\nβ-sitosterol, see Figure 22. The resultant amphiphile, SPGS-550-M, otherwise known\nas “Nok”, was designed to be a more economically attractive\nsurfactant when compared with PTS and TPGS-750-M.229 Synthesis is similar to previous variants, with condensation\nof β-sitosterol with succinic anhydride, followed by further\nreaction with PEG-550-M.229 In the publication,\nthrough an extensive comparison process with TPGS-750-M, Nok was shown\nto perform as effectively as or more effectively than TPGS-750-M in\na range of reactions including metathesis, Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, Miyaura borylations, and Buchwald Hartwig aminations.229 Recent developments by the Lipshutz group have\nseen the invention of a low foaming surfactant known as “Coolade”.252 It is known that foaming can occur in surfactants\nthat possess long hydrophobic tails, the long tail leading to increased\nfoam volume and stability.252 Coolade does\nnot possess this tail, yet can still self-assemble into micelles.\nTypical reactions that suffered from foaming/frothing when conducted\nTPGS-750M, such as NaBH4 nitro reductions, were shown to\nbe free from foam when employing Coolade. Foam is generally seen as\nan inconvenience at best with larger reaction volumes and vessels\nrequired.252 Workup and product isolation\nmay also become complicated. Other reactions successfully demonstrated\nincluded double reduction of geminal dibromocyclopropanes, azide\nand sulfonyl azide reductions, and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling. β-Sitosterol\nmethoxypolyethylene glycol succinate SPGS-550-M\n(Nok). In 2019, the DMSO inspired surfactant\n“MC-1” was\ndeveloped by Cortes-Clerget et al., and it is a designer surfactant\nthat specifically tailors to the needs of peptide chemistry, see Figure 23. The micelle accommodates\nboth amino acids/peptide starting materials and typical coupling reagents\nsuch as COMU in a polar yet still lipophilic environment.253 Multigram synthesis of dipeptides was successfully\nconducted in high yields (>90%) using this surfactant. MC-1, a designer\nsurfactant successfully used for peptide coupling\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions. Nonionic designer surfactant stearyl methoxyPEGglycol succinate\n(SMPS) was designed and successfully implemented in nitro-arene reduction\nand tethered indole synthesis by Kothandapani et al., see Figure 24(254) Apart from high yielding synthesis of the target substrates\nin this SMPS-water system, a preliminary toxicity screen was also\nconducted, which included phytotoxicity, bacterial toxicity, and aquatic\ntoxicity. It was shown at the concentrations screened that seed growth\nwas not affected compared to controls nor were there significant bacterial\ntoxicity effects or harmful effects toward zebrafish during the aquatic\ntoxicity screening.254 The surfactant design\nconcept used here was structured around the “Benign by Design”\nprinciple central to green chemistry.255 Designer surfactant SMPS used for Zn mediated nitro-arene reduction\nunder aqueous-micellar conditions.254 Utilizing surfactants in organic chemistry can\nbe challenging and\noften lack generality when it comes to surfactant choice, that is,\nthere is no one universal surfactant. Often, starting material solubility\nis problematic, and organic cosolvents have been utilized to change\nthe nature and dynamics of the emulsions formed. One particularly\nproblem was assessed by Sanzone et al. for the synthesis of rigid\nand poorly soluble organic semiconductor molecules.256 It was hypothesized that by increasing the aromatic content\nof the hydrophobic portion of the surfactant, additional π–π\ninteractions could be facilitated between the surfactant and reaction\nstarting materials. Thus, successful dispersion of starting materials\nthat exhibit self-aggregation due to π–π interactions\nwith themselves could be achieved. The surfactant designed, PiNAP-750M,\nsee Figure 25, allowed\nfor the generation of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling products at room\ntemperature, without cosolvent, and in short reaction times (of 10\nmin), see Scheme 6.\nReaction times were much slower when conducted in commercially available\nsurfactants such as K-EL (hours to days longer). E-factors were also\ndemonstrated to be up to an order of magnitude lower than the currently\npublished synthetic routes utilizing organic solvents when using the\nPiNAP-750M system.256 Designer surfactant\nPiNAP-750M exhibiting additional aromatic conjugation\nin the hydrophobic region.256 Designer surfactants can also be prepared from biorenewable materials,\nsuch as the synthesis of APGS-550-M from resin acids (from rosin)\nsuch as abietic acid, see Figure 26. The surfactant, prepared by Yang et al., was shown\nto be highly effective in facilitating Cu-mediated amidation of alkynyl\nbromides under aqueous-micellar conditions, see Scheme 7.257 Normally,\nthis type of transformation is conducted in dry solvents such as DMF,\nDMSO, or toluene at elevated temperatures. Side-reactions that can\noccur include homocoupling of alkynes to give 1,3-diynes, hydration\nof the diynes to furans, and hydration of ynamides to amides;257 thus, the presence of water in the system is\nsomewhat counterintuitive. However, the micellar conditions allow\nfor smooth conversion of bromoalkynes to the corresponding ynamides.\nA variety of alkyl and aryl groups were tolerated under the conditions\nand electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) such as amides, p-toluenesulfonamides, N-phenyl methanesulfonamides, oxazolidinones, and N-phenyl methanesulfonamides were all compatible with\nthis methodology showing broad functional group tolerance for this\ntype of transformation. Finally, the reaction medium was shown to\nbe recyclable as long as additional copper was added, and by the third\nrun using recycled medium, the reaction E-factor was as low as 5. APGS-550-M,\nprepared from potential biorenewable sources such as\nrosin and succinic acid. Chen et al. have also sought\nto exploit rosin as a potential source\nof raw materials for the synthesis of surfactants, see Figure 27.258 DAPGS-750-M is structurally related to APGS-550-M in that it is\nalso derived from abietic acid. Aqueous-micellar conditions using\nthis surfactant have allowed for β-scission of −CH3 from a range of aromatic tertiary alcohols to give corresponding\nketones. The same reaction conducted in traditional organic solvents,\nbinary aqueous–organic mixtures, and aqueous-micellar conditions\nsuch as TPGS-750-M, gave poor yields, see Scheme 8. One potential reason for this is due to\nthe different shape, size, and distribution of the DAPGS micelles\nwhen compared to other surfactants examined in this publication.258 A variety of acetophenone-like molecules were\nprepared from the corresponding tertiary alcohols in moderate to excellent\nyields, though anilines were not tolerated at all. Furthermore, bulky\nβ-carbon groups were preferentially eliminated in preference\nof methyl groups. In-flask recycling of the aqueous-micellar system\nwas also demonstrated with an E-factor of 11 observed after three\nruns. DAPGS-750M, a dehydroabietinol-derived surfactant.\n\n## PS-750-M\nPS-750-M, also known\nas FI-750-M, is a surfactant first described in 2017 in a publication\nby Handa et al. in collaboration with Novartis, for an aqueous media-based\npalladium-catalyzed coupling of nitroalkanes and aryl bromides.238 Derived from the naturally occurring amino\nacid l-proline, the surfactant can be prepared in a high-yielding\n4-step synthesis (overall 53% across 4 steps, Scheme 4).

It is envisaged that these case studies\nand examples will provide reliable literature references from which\nchemists can rely for inspiration and encouragement when potentially\nconducting solvent screening/swapping investigations of their own. The amide moiety\nis abundant within drug molecules,259 and\namide coupling has been consistently highlighted as the most frequently\nemployed transformation in medicinal chemistry (Scheme 9, Scheme 10).260 Traditionally, amide\ncoupling has relied heavily on solvents with major regulatory issues\nsuch as dichloromethane and DMF, which are classed as solvents of\nconcern.44 On the basis of the importance\nof amide bond formation, it is pertinent that greener and more sustainable\nsolvent use should be explored whenever possible. Several examples of amide coupling reactions employing previously\ndiscussed sustainable alternatives to dipolar aprotics are discussed\nbelow. Recently, Camp and co-workers reported the synthesis of amides\nfrom acid chlorides and amines in the biobased solvent Cyrene.125 The substrate scope was investigated pertaining\nto both the acid chlorides and primary amines. Crucially, the addition\nof water allowed for precipitation of the product and facile isolation\nfrom the Cyrene solvent without the use of chromatography, see Scheme 9. Watson and co-workers\nhave also evaluated the use of Cyrene in the HATU-mediated synthesis\nof amides and peptides.119 It was found\nthat Cyrene was an effective replacement for DMF and NMP in the synthesis\nof lead-like molecules. Conditions were established that demonstrated\na broad functional group tolerance and broad generality after evaluating\n25 examples, with yields ranged from 63–100%, see Scheme 10. In 2017, Hunt\nand co-workers published an article comparing the utility of 2,2,5,5-tetramethyloxolane\n(TMO) in a series of reactions, one of being formation of an amide\nfrom phenylbutanoic acid and benzyl amine (Scheme 11), with traditional solvents\nsuch as toluene.103 In the studies, reaction\nkinetics analysis of the amide formation resulted in similar reaction\nrates to the effective toluene and p-cymene solvents,\nalthough the basicity (β) of TMO was similar to the less effective\nDMSO (Figure 28).\nAlso in this report is discussed the nature of ethers containing α-protons\nto the oxygen to form dangerous peroxides in solution, upon irradiation\nwith UV light. In a comparative irradiation experiment, traditional\nperoxide-forming ethers THF, 2-MeTHF, and diethyl ether formed varying\namounts of detectable peroxide over a period of six months, whereas\na solution of TMO stored under identical conditions formed no detectable\nperoxide. Reaction\nkinetic analysis for TMO (TMTHF)-mediated amide bond formation\nconducted by Byrne et al.103 Reproduced\nfrom ref (103) with\npermission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. Handa et al. have recently developed solvent-free methodology for\nfast and clean amide couplings in water that require no extraction,\nchromatography, or crystallization (Scheme 12).261 This is\nachieved by use of the l-proline-based amphiphile PS-750-M,\ndeveloped by the group.238 In the micelle\nof PS-750-M, the presence of 3° amides from the surfactant proline\nlinker structurally mimics DMF, NMP, and DMAc solvents. This allows\nextremely fast amide couplings, mediated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)\ncarbodiimide (EDC), rather than expensive and specialized coupling\nreagents. The conditions developed by the group result in the precipitation\nof the product and isolation by filtration. The methodology is also\nreproducible on different reaction scales. Mechanistic and kinetic\ninsights into PS-705-M mediated fast amide bond formation have also\nbeen provided.262 A similar approach to that of Handa et al. is that of the Lipshutz\ngroup, inventors of the α-tocopherol derived surfactant TPGS-750-M,55 who demonstrated in 2015 that amide bond formation\ncan be rapidly conducted in TPGS-750-M–water systems in high\nyields. Products are extracted from the surfactant–water system\nusing an organic solvent. The surfactant has been designed to be preferentially\nsoluble in aqueous layers leading to facile product recovery and ease\nof recyclability of the surfactant–water phase (5 cycles conducted)\nand low E-factors (organic solvent + water E factor = 7.8).263 Reaction times were typically 1–4 h,\nand yields of amino acid amide couplings to give dipeptides (19 compounds)\nranged from 84 to 99%. In 2013, Watson et al. published a solvent-reagent\nguide evaluating the use of greener alternatives to DMF and DCM for\namide bond formation. It was shown that reaction rates and yields\nfor alternative solvents such as dimethylcarbonate, EtOAc, and\n2-MeTHF were comparable to DCM and DMF and could be considered as\npractical alternatives for both academic and industrial use. CPME\nwas shown to be a poor alternative, most likely due to reaction mixtures\nbecoming heterogeneous as they progressed.264 Amidation in water using N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide\n(DIC) as coupling reagent has been effectively demonstrated by Fattahi\net al. with no requirement for surfactant additives.265 Both aromatic and aliphatic acids were shown to be compatible\nwith this methodology. Catalytic amide bond formation was reported\nby Coomber et al. in\n2019 using a combination of B(OCH2CF3)3 in tert-butyl acetate, see Scheme 13. Significantly, this methodology allows\nfor the coupling of unprotected amino acids in high yields. Scales\nof up to 100 mmol were demonstrated with product isolation achieved\nby resin catch and release protocols.266 Ultrafast amidation reactions using lithium\namides under aerobic\nconditions and ambient temperatures have recently been reported by\nFairley et al. under these conditions, amidation of ester starting\nmaterials. The reaction proceeds via C–O bond cleavage and\nis complete in just 20 s. Solvents employed were either 2-MeTHF or\nglycerol.267 High yields and good selectivity\nwere generally observed making this methodology an advancement in\naccessing carboxamides by sustainable means via air and moisture compatible\norganometallic chemistry. A further push toward substitution\nof regulated solvents used in\namidation reactions with more sustainable biobased solvents, such\nas p-cymene, was demonstrated by Clark and co-workers\nfrom the University of York in 2018 (Scheme 14).268 Discovery\nof a preferred alternative to toluene for this transformation (which\ncould also act as an alternative to dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMF) also removes concerns associated with reproductive toxicity.269 A direct comparison of yields for toluene and p-cymene in a silica-catalyzed amidation of carboxylic acids,\nacross a varied substrate scope of 13 amides, was performed. In the\nmajority of cases, p-cymene outperformed that of\ntoluene when carried out under reflux (bp 177 °C). This methodology\nhas further enhanced sustainability, with facile purification through\namide precipitation, recycling of solvents, and use of a reusable\nsolid-supported catalyst. Palladium\ncatalysis is used extensively in both industrial and academic synthetic\nchemistry laboratories as a powerful methodology for the formation\nof C–C bonds. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of organoboronic\nacids and their derivatives is the most frequently utilized palladium-catalyzed\nC–C bond forming reactions in the chemical industry, see Scheme 15.14 Traditionally, ethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and\nTHF or dipolar aprotics such as DMF are employed for a large proportion\nof these reactions.14 Owing to the frequent\nuse and importance of this reaction, there is great potential for\n“greener” solvent alternatives to have a significant\nimpact. Note that discussion surrounding the use of Suzuki-Miyaura\nreactions as a benchmark for the performance of new solvents suggests\nthat it is not the most informative reaction manifold.270 For example, cross-coupling can be successfully\nconducted in rapeseed oil and butter with both of these lipid-based\nsystems outperforming benchmark solvent DMF.271 Watson and co-workers developed a mild method\nfor the Suzuki-Miyaura\nreaction that employed Cyrene as a greener alternative to the commonly\nused dipolar aprotic solvents (Scheme 16).14 The reaction\nscope was extensively explored by varying both the organoboron nucleophile\nand aryl electrophile. The conditions developed demonstrated excellent\ngenerality and functional group tolerance. The group reported 57 examples\nwith yields ranging from 44 to 100%, from discovery to gram-scale\nreactions. Hunt et al. have explored the use of NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent\nfor Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 17.110 Yields for\na series of reactions performed in both NMP and NBP have been reported,\nto carry out a comparison, using a range of different substituted\naryl halides to explore the scope. Although the results showed that\nreactions using NMP as solvent gave better yields overall (76–90%\nfor model reactions utilizing 4-iodoacetophenone and a range\nof phenylboronic acids), reactions carried out in NBP still gave good\nyields (∼10% lower for the same model reaction), as seen in Table 5. However, the reactions\nhad not been optimized to specifically favor N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\nso there may also be potential to improve the performance of these\nreactions. Dimethyl isosorbide has been\ndemonstrated as an effective reaction\nmedium for several classical cross-coupling reactions. In 2018, Watson\net al. reported the use of DMI in several Suzuki-Miyaura reactions\n(12 substrates). In general, aromatics with various electron donating\nand withdrawing groups were tolerated as were variations in the electrophilic\ncomponent including vinyl groups, boronic acids, and pinacol esters.214 Reaction times were 1 h conducted at 60 °C\nwith 4 mol % Pd(dppf)Cl2, and yields ranged from 62 to\n>99%. Garg and co-workers have reported the nickel-catalyzed\nSuzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling between aryl halides and (hetero)aromatic boronic\nacids in a number of greener solvent alternatives.272 Initial solvent screening showed that EtOAc, iPrOH, 2-MeTHF,\nand t-amyl alcohol were all demonstrated to be excellent\nalternatives, see Scheme 18, to traditionally employed solvents such as toluene or 1,4-dioxane.\nThe reaction scope was further explored using 2-MeTHF and t-amyl alcohol as solvents. The scope was found to be broad\npertaining to both coupling partners, with heterocycles well tolerated\n(Scheme 18). The methodology\nwas demonstrated on multigram scales using low catalyst loadings (0.5–1.0\nmol % nickel) to provide desired products in reasonable to excellent\nyields. 2-MeTHF has also been successfully employed as reaction solvent\nin palladium–NHC-catalyzed amide and ester cleaving cross-coupling\nreactions.273 Following the emergence of eucalyptol as a sustainable,\nbioderived\nsolvent, the utility of it in cross-coupling reactions has been explored\nin a number of transformations by Berteina-Raboin and colleagues.205−207 When tested in palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling\nreactions of arylboronic acids with heteroaryl chlorides, eucalyptol\noutperformed reactions conducted in THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, with\nyields ranging from 44 to 99%. Reaction temperatures of 100 °C\nwere required for complete dissolution of reagents. The\nMizoroki-Heck cross-coupling, commonly referred to as the Heck cross-coupling,\ninvolves the reaction of an aryl halide with an alkene under Pd(0)/Pd(II)\ncatalysis. Common reaction solvents for the Heck reaction include\n1,4-dioxane, THF, and amide-based solvents such as DMF and DMAc, see Scheme 19. Although there\nare examples using more sustainable solvents such as water and acetonitrile,\nexpansion of the available green solvents for the transformation is\nunderway.110,214 Hunt et al. have explored the scope and limitations of the use\nof NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent for the Heck cross-coupling reaction,\nsee Scheme 20, in\naddition to Suzuki-Miyaura couplings.110 The group reported and compared the yields from a series of reactions\nperformed in both NMP and NBP. In summary, they found that the Heck\nreactions carried out in NBP gave comparable to or higher yields than\nthose carried out in NMP, see Table 6. This comparison has demonstrated that NBP was a viable\nreplacement to NMP as reaction solvent in the Heck cross-coupling\nreactions examined. Dimethyl isosorbide has also been\ndemonstrated as an effective\nreaction medium for the Mizoroki-Heck reaction by Watson et al.214 Optimized reaction conditions using 5 mol %\nPd(dppf)Cl2 were trialled on 12 substrates and showed that\nthe reaction proceeded well with aryl iodides and bromides facilitating\ncoupling of both electron poor and rich arenes with a variety of vinyl\nketones and acrylamides in 47–91% yield. Reactions were generally\nconducted at 80 °C for 1 h though some aryl bromide examples\nrequired heating at 115 °C for 24 h.214 Another alternative class of solvents shown to have utility\nin\nMizoroki-Heck cross-couplings reactions is that of cyclic carbonates,\nsee Figure 29. In\na study evaluating the use of a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents\nfor the transformation, Clark and colleagues demonstrated the effective\nuse of propylene and ethylene carbonate in the place of NMP and DMSO.107 In many cases, both cyclic carbonate solvents\nperformed as or more effectively than NMP across a wide substrate\nscope, tolerating substrates of various electronics.

Recently, Su et al.\nhave demonstrated that DMI could be effectively\nutilized in a Ni-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling of aryl bromides\nwith vinyl acetate (acting as a vinylating reagent).274 Moderate to excellent yields of the vinylated products\nwere observed across a wide and varied heteroaryl substrate scope,\nsee Scheme 21. The Sonogashira\ncross-coupling is a widely used palladium and copper-catalyzed process\nfor accessing functionalized alkyne species from terminal alkynes\nand aryl halides, see Scheme 22.275 Another powerful C–C\nbond forming reaction, the Sonogashira reaction is commonly performed\nin THF and DMF,276 both of which are problematic\ndue to peroxide formation and reprotoxicity, respectively. Because\nof the efficiency and widespread use of this reaction in both academia\nand industry, a search for greener solvent alternatives is highly\ndesirable. Cyrene has been successfully\nutilized by Watson et al. as reaction\nsolvent for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 23.127 Utilization of the safer, more sustainable Cyrene as an alternative\nto traditionally employed DMF127 was demonstrated\nacross a number of aryl and heteroaryl iodides and alkyne coupling\npartners. Broad tolerance to the optimized reaction conditions was\nobserved with yields of 65–99% generally reported, though yield\nvariability was observed for some electron deficient aryl bromides\n(28–99%). Further expansion of the methodology to Cacchi-type\nannulations furnished benzofuran and indole scaffolds in good to excellent\nyields (73–100%), see Scheme 24. Dimethyl isosorbide has been successfully utilized as\nreaction\nsolvent for the Sonogashira reaction by Watson et al. Twelve substrates\nwere synthesized using the same catalyst and base conditions as depicted\nin Scheme 23 (reactions\nwere conducted at 25 °C).214 A range\nof aryl iodides and bromides including electron rich and deficient\nexamples, and a number of functionalized alkynes including BMIDA and\nTIPS functionalities, were synthesized in 83–98% yields. One\nexample of a thiophenol derived alkyne was synthesized, though in\na lower yield of 65%.214 Cabri and\nco-workers have recently published an investigation into\nthe use of N-substituted-pyrrolidinone solvents,\nalong with a small number of others, as a reaction medium for the\nSonogashira coupling.276 Given the knowledge\nof the reprotoxicity problems associated with NMP,17 the safer and more sustainable species discussed, such\nas NBP (N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone) and NCP (N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidinone), were shown to outperform\nDMF and NMP following optimization of reaction conditions. In addition\nto the broad substrate scope (generally >90% isolated yields),\nthe\nmethodology was applied to the synthesis of Erlotinib, performing\na Sonogashira cross-coupling step in quantitative yield, without the\nneed for a CuI additive, see Figure 30.276 Yield comparison for\nmodel Sonogashira reaction conducted by Cabri\net al. using a variety of NMP/DMF drop-in replacements.276 In addition to the previously\nmentioned explorations of the utility\nof eucalyptol as a solvent in palladium-catalyzed processes, it was\nalso shown to be effective in Sonogashira cross-couplings.277 A slightly different system to regular Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, utilizing Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 and\nPCy3, without addition of CuI, furnished a range of cross-coupled\nproducts in moderate to good yields.277 It was noted that the cross-coupling of any heterocycles containing\nfree amine functionality, such as 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine is ineffective when using eucalyptol\nas the solvent; further investigations are required to optimize this\nprocess such that yields are comparable to those obtained using traditional\nSonogashira solvents such as DMF. Buchwald-Hartwig\namination is a widely employed cross-coupling strategy used for the\nformation of C–N bonds, see Scheme 25. Commonly used for substrates that are\nless reactive to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the palladium-catalyzed\ntransformation is also known to perform well with oxygen and sulfur\nnucleophiles.278,279 1,4-Dioxane is commonly utilized\nas reaction solvent for these transformations, and 1,4-dioxane has\nserious issues and is regarded as a solvent of concern.280 A number of strategies\nto overcome this issue include reactions\nconducted solvent-free,281 in water,282 or using water–surfactant systems.55 In 2014, the Lipshutz group published methodology\ndescribing Buchwald-Hartwig amination using the TPGS-750-M surfactant–water\nsystem, see Scheme 26. In 2020, Manikandan and co-workers\nopted for the use of 2-MeTHF\nin the synthesis of a triazolo-pyridazine-6-yl-substituted via a Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-coupling.283 The 2-MeTHF was used\nas the solvent in the final stage of the synthesis for 12 medicinally\nrelevant antidiabetic compounds, and yields were reported in the range\nof 92–98% using a catalytic combination of 10 mol % Pd2(dba)3/XPhos, in the presence of NaOtBu at room temperature for 4 h, see Scheme 27. The use of a surfactant however is not always necessary, and aqueous\nsingle or two-phase systems have been known in the Pd-catalyzed amination\nmanifold.284 Further exploration into aqueous\nsystems has also been conducted and was well documented by Buchwald\net al. in 2003.285 Water has also\nbeen successfully utilized as reaction solvent in\nrelated Cu-catalyzed Ullman-type reactions,286 as have other safer solvents such as tBuOH.287 Solvent-free examples are also known.288 Bio-based solvent eucalyptol has also been studied\nfor its potential\nuse as solvent in the Buchwald-Hartwig amination, see Scheme 28. A number of model reactions\nwere examined encompassing a variety of bromoarenes and amines and\nanilines. Moderate to excellent yields were obtained (43–99%),\nin many cases better than the reported yields for the analogous reaction\nconducted in a conventional dipolar aprotic solvent.289 Ma et al. have demonstrated\nthat tBuOH could be\neffectively used as an alternative to 1,4-dioxane in the cross-coupling\nof amino acid esters with aryl bromides and chlorides, see Scheme 29.290 The methodology was not just limited to α-amino acids\nbut also included β-, γ-, and δ-, proteinogenic,\nand nonproteinogenic amino acids. Products were prepared generally\nin moderate to high yields with retention of optical activity. Other\nexamples utilizing tBuOH in Pd catalyzed C–N\nhave also been reported,291 and alcohols,\nsuch as iPrOH, have also seen use in Pd-catalyzed\nC–N and C–O bond forming reactions.292 Solvent-free, ball milling conditions have been described\nby Shao et al. in 2018.293 A solvent selection guide for conducting acyl Buchwald-Hartwig\ntransamidation reactions has recently been compiled by Lei et al.\nIn their study, an exhaustive solvent screen of alternative solvents\nhas been conducted including 2-MeTHF, CPME, GVL, anisole, and p-cymene, see Scheme 30.294 1,2-Dimethoxyethane\nwas used as a benchmark solvent, giving 86% yield in the same transformation.\nBoth 2-MeTHF and MTBE showed excellent generality and applicability\nacross a wide range of transamidation coupling partners demonstrated\nthrough a substrate screen consisting of a variety of anilines and\namides bearing EDGs and EWGs. Thus, dipolar aprotics of concern in\nthese reactions such as THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane can be effectively\nreplaced by a drop-in alternative.294 Because of\nthe widespread use of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, and variants thereof,\nin synthetic and medicinal chemistry,14 and the requirement for a boronic acid or boronate coupling partner,\nsustainable methods for accessing these moieties are highly desirable.\nTraditional methods for preparation of boronic acids and boronates,\nsuch as the Miyaura borylation (Scheme 31), require dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMSO, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane.295 Recently, advancements have been made toward more sustainable\nsolvents\nfor borylation reactions, with cyclic ethers and cyclic ketones being\nused as substitutes. A recent publication by Frantz and co-workers\ndescribes a sustainable method for accessing arylboronic acids from\npseudohalides and B2(OH)4 using a 0.01 mol %\npalladium catalyst loading in a 1:1 mixture of 2-MeTHF and MeOH, see Scheme 32.296 Also described is a direct one-pot conversion of aryl halide\nto the boronic acid diethanolamine (DEA) adduct, providing synthesis\nof boronate species less susceptible to protodeboronation.297 This transformation is well-tolerated for aryl\nand (hetero)aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides, with yields ranging\nfrom 60–85%, on the choice of catalyst, (AtaPhos)2PdCl2 or XPhos-Pd-G3. The effectiveness of the methodology\nis demonstrated by a one-pot tandem borylation-Suzuki sequence, furnishing\na diverse range of C–C coupled products with no more than 2\nmol % palladium used for the overall two-step process. Many more examples\nof greener palladium-catalyzed borylations of aryl halides using B2(OH)4 or B2pin2 are known\nin 2-MeTHF298 and CPME.299 Although not as widely used as aryl and hetero(aryl)boronic\nacids and boronates, alkenyl boronates have important applications\nin Diels–Alder cycloadditions, as precursors to cyclopropyl\nboronates, and as effective radical acceptors.300 Recently, a number of publications have highlighted the\nuse of sustainable solvents in borylation reactions of alkynes, both\nrhodium301 and copper-catalyzed.302 A publication by Hutzler and co-workers in\n2017, outlining routes to the synthesis of herbicides, included a\nrhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with HBpin, with a solvent\nchoice of cyclohexanone.301 The reaction,\ncarried out below room temperature (18 °C), yielded the desired Z-alkene in 52% yield after 2 h (Scheme 33). Similarly, a publication by Woźniak and co-workers in 2019,\nshowcasing the utility of copper-NHC complexes containing sulfone\nand sulfoxide side-chains, describes a low catalyst loading (0.05\nmol %) hydroboration of alkynes, using CPME as the solvent, with a\nMeOH additive (10:1), see Scheme 34.302 In this instance, CPME\noutperforms both isopropanol and toluene, and the catalytic system\napplies to both alkynes (yielding alkenyl boronates) and alkenes (yielding\nalkyl boronates). Yields for all substrates studied are in excess\nof 95%, proving the methodology a very powerful and sustainable way\nto hydroborate alkynes and alkenes. In addition to solvent swaps to\nCPME, 2-MeTHF, and cyclohexanone, MTBE has also been shown to be highly\neffective in borylation sequences. Reported in 2009, Marder and co-workers\nutilized the solvent in a one-pot C–H borylation/Suzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling sequence, a transformation shown to be highly effective\nfor both aryl and heteroaryl substrates.174 Borylation in protic solvents such as MeOH303 and EtOH304 has also been reported including\nin the 2020 report on transition metal-free borylation of aryl halides\nusing bis-boronic acid in MeOH.305 The direct\nactivation and functionalization of C–H bonds, which avoids\nthe installation of intermediate functional groups, is both step-\nand atom-efficient, see Scheme 35. However, the sustainability of C–H activation\nis hindered (especially for large-scale chemistry) by numerous factors,\none of these being the introduction of safer, greener, and more sustainable\nsolvents. In many examples of chemistry involving C–H activation,\ngreen solvents have been too easily overlooked in preference to solvents\nsuch as THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, which have been frequently used.306 The inclusion of safer solvents such as 2-MeTHF\n(and exploring less conventional PEG or aqueous-micellar systems)\nduring reaction optimization and solvent screening is therefore critical\nif the field of C–H activation is to migrate away from solvents\nof concern. Reviews on the subject of emerging unconventional organic\nsolvents for C–H bond activation have been published in 2019\nby Gandeepan et al.,307 in 2020 by Yu et\nal.,308 and in 2021 by Dhawa et al.309 and Dalton et al.306 We direct the reader toward these bodies of work for further information\nand specific examples. The 2-MeTHF was used as a replacement to THF and 1,4-dioxane by\nAckerman and co-workers in a mild C–H activation of allenes\nusing a Fe(0) phosphine catalyst (Scheme 36).310 Across\na selection of aryl substrates containing an α-ketone directing\ngroup, efficient C–H functionalization using Fe(PMe3)4 yielded a diverse range of products in good to excellent\nyields. Also demonstrated was a tolerability of hydroxyl, amino, and\nalkoxycarbonyl moieties, in addition to mechanistic and computational\ninvestigations. The bioderived solvent eucalyptol has also been shown to have utility\nas a solvent for direct C–H arylations by Berteina-Raboin and\ncolleagues.277 Following synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines from the corresponding 2-aminopyridine\nand 2-bromoacetophenone derivatives, Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed\ndirect C–H arylation at the C-3 position using bromobenzene\nin eucalyptol yielded the desired arylated product in 60% (5 mol %\ncat.) and 61% yields (10 mol % cat.) after 24 h at 150 °C, see Scheme 37. Other bio-based\nsolvents such as cumene have also been promoted as a potential solvent\nfor C–H bond activation chemistry.308 A regioselective C–H functionalization of 1,2,3-triazoles\nin GVL was accomplished by Vaccaro and co-workers in continuous flow,\nsee Scheme 38. Across\n8 substrates, excellent yields (79–91%) of the cyclized product\nwere obtained, with solvent recovery and reuse, without further purification,\nalso demonstrated.311 Kakiuchi and co-workers developed a Ru-catalyzed stereoselective\nC–H arylation of ortho-methoxylated acetophenones and C–H\nmonoarylation of ortho-unsubstituted acetophenones in high yields\nusing cyclohexanone as solvent, see Scheme 39. Note: styrene was utilized as a necessary\nadditive to selectively provide monoarylation.312,313 Aqueous surfactant systems such as TPGS750M-H2O have\nalso been successfully utilized in ruthenium-catalyzed C–H\narylation reactions.314 PEG-based systems have been demonstrated as promising alternatives\nto conventional solvents as evidenced by Ackermann et al., who first\nshowed in 2009 that PEG-20000 could be used as solvent for either\nRu- or Pd-catalyzed direct arylation chemistry.315 This discovery has led to other PEG-derived systems such\nas that demonstrated by Reddy et al.316 who showed that PEG-400 was an excellent solvent for Cu-mediated\ncross-coupling of oxadiazoles with dibromoalkenes, see Scheme 40. When conventional\nsolvents such as CH3CN and DCM were screened instead of\nthe PEG, no reaction took place. The t-butyl carbamate (Boc)\ngroup is a common protecting group for amines,\nmost often utilized in multistep syntheses due to its stability under\na wide range of reaction conditions. One of the most common methods\nof deprotection typically employs 4 M HCl in 1,4-dioxane, a solvent\nit would be good to replace when possible, see Scheme 41. Commercially available alternatives to 1,4-dioxane\npreparations\nof HCl are available in safer, more sustainable solvents including\nethereal alternative CPME.317 Given the\nincreasing availability of HCl solutions in more sustainable solvents,\nit is recommended that alternative mixtures are considered before\nopting to use HCl in 1,4-dioxane. Several examples throughout the\nliterature demonstrate the utility of more sustainable methods for\nBoc deprotections, as part of lengthy syntheses. As part of\nthe design and testing of a sustainable methodology\nfor an improved Pinner reaction in CPME, Torisawa and co-workers discuss\nthe use of a 4 M solution of HCl in CPME for the deprotection of a\nBoc-protected amino acid derivative.318 Stirring of the derivative for 6 h at 0 °C provided the desired\ndeprotected amine in 97% yield, with the workup procedure also employing\nthe greener solvent. A common alternative acidic medium for the deprotection\nof Boc groups involves the use of CF3CO2H, trifluoroacetic\nacid (TFA). The use of TFA within a sustainable solvent was demonstrated\nas part of a peptide coupling by North et al. in 2017, in which the\nfinal Boc deprotection step used a solution of TFA in propylene carbonate,\nsee Scheme 42.319 Use of this combination provided sequential\ndeprotection yields between 80 and 99% yields in the three individual\nBoc deprotection steps in the multistep synthesis of tetrapeptides. An additional example demonstrating the deprotection of a Boc group\nwas reported in a Pfizer patent in 2005.320 Instead of using TFA or HCl, a biphasic mixture of sodium tert-butoxide in H2O/2-MeTHF provided improved\nconditions for the deprotection of a range of heterocyclic substrates\nwith medicinal applications, see Scheme 43.158 Aldehydes, amides, esters, and carboxylic\nacids are abundant groups\nin synthetic organic chemistry, whether as part of a reaction intermediate\nor pharmaceutically relevant scaffold. Traditional methods for the\npreparation of such species include hydroformylations of alkenes and\namide couplings, to name a few, which often require toxic heavy metals,321 pyrophoric organometallic reagents,322 or allergenic amide coupling reagents.323 In recent years there has been a shift toward\ncatalytic methodologies including palladium-catalyzed formylations\nand carbonylations of aryl halides using carbon monoxide gas or surrogates\nthereof.324 Unfortunately, use of the gas\nis often accompanied by the use of dipolar aprotic solvents such as\nDMF,325 see Schemes 44 and 45, or 1,4-dioxane,326 see Scheme 46, to aid the solubility of the gas in the reaction\nmedium.327 Recently, there has been interest in substituting reprotoxic dipolar\naprotic solvents with more sustainable alternatives for carbonylation\nreactions. One of the alternative solvents for such transformations\nhas been the cellulose-derived solvent GVL. In 2016, initial exploratory\nwork into the use of biomass-derived solvents by Mika and colleagues\nrevealed the utility of GVL in the aminocarbonylation of aryl\nhalides under CO(g), see Scheme 47.328 In a system catalyzed\nby Pd(OAc)2/PPh3, it was shown that a mixture\nof the carboxamide and ketocarboxamide products could be obtained,\nand relative ratio of the ketocarboxamide could be favored by\nincreasing of CO(g) pressure, see Table 7.328 Following\non from this initial work, the group later published\na palladium-catalyzed carbonylative esterification of aryl iodides\nwith a wide range of alcohols in 2020.329 Again using GVL, the transformation provided a wide range of ester\nproducts with significantly improved yields compared to the previous\naminocarbonylation,328 ranging from\n39 to 99% with phenol coupling partners and 13–99% with alkyl\nalcohol coupling partners, see Scheme 48.329 In 2019, Schwab and co-workers\nreported a simple and efficient\naminocarbonylation process to access 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides\nfrom the related heteroaryl iodide species.330 The Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed process involved in situ generation of CO(g) using a combination of H2SO4 and HCO2H within CO-ware equipment.\nUtilizing the sustainable solvent dimethyl carbonate, a variety of\nfunctionalized 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides were produced, with yields\nranging from 33 to 98% (Scheme 49).330 In the area of carboxylation reactions, in 2015, Levacher\nand co-workers\nreported a sustainable carboxylation of organic (heteroaryl, alkenyl,\nand allyl) halides in 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 50.331 Using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl formate as a CO2(g)\nsurrogate, and in the process eliminating the requirement for a high\nCO2-solubilizing dipolar aprotic solvent and opting for\nthe use of 2-MeTHF, a wide range of N-hydroxysuccinimide\nesters were accessible (Scheme 50). The methodology was shown to be effective in the\ncarboxylation of a functionalized quinoline intermediate in the preparation\nof a number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, with\nthe transformation progressing in 82% isolated yield.331 Metal-catalyzed hydroamination of styrenes has recently been reported\nby Mulks et al., see Scheme 51. In their work, the conventional wisdom of air- and moisture-free\norganometallic reactions is challenged by their demonstration of hydroamination\nof aryl alkenes in 2-MeTHF using lithium amides, see Table 8. Reactions were open to air\nand moisture and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Yields were\nmoderate to excellent with some incompatibility observed when using\nstyrenes containing aryl halide moieties.332 Remarkably, the presence of adventitious moisture was shown to be\nbeneficial and not detrimental. Reactions were accelerated by moisture,\nwhich generated free amine in situ at a steady rate.332 Sodium amides were also shown to be compatible\nwith the methodology. In 2020, a publication by Gevorgyan et al.\ninvestigated the utility\nof newly discovered biomass-sourced solvents in carboxylation reactions.208 In an overall transformation for the hydrocarboxylation\nof alkenes, via a boronate species from an initial hydroboration with\n9-BBN, sustainable solvents including eucalyptol, dimethyl isosorbide\n(DMI), and GVL were screened, see Scheme 52. Given that the process occurs via a boronate\nspecies, the effectiveness of the secondary carboxylation of boronic\nacid pinacol esters, Bpins, was also explored. For the overall hydrocarboxylation\nof 4-methylstyrene, 2-MeTHF, eucalyptol, DMI, and GVL were all found\nto outperform dipolar aprotics of concern including THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nsee Table 9. The hydroboration\nmethodology was not restricted to just benzylic alkenes, that is,\nstyrenes.208 For the conversion of phenyl Bpin to the corresponding phenyl carboxylic\nacid, of the general type depicted in Scheme 53, DMI was found to outperform THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nwith 2-MeTHF and (+)-rose oxide also notably performing above 70%\nyield (Table 10).\nIn addition to these two reactions, the solvents were comparatively\nscreened for numerous other carboxylation processes including transition\nmetal-catalyzed carboxylations (copper, zirconium, iron, and nickel).208 The Cu-catalyzed carboyxylation methodology\nwas further applied toward the synthesis of active pharmaceutical\ningredients Fenoprofen (60% yield) and Flurbiprofen (53% yield). Pd-catalyzed alkoxy- and amino-carbonylation and aryl bromide/boronic\nacid carbonylation in greener more sustainable solvents has been recently\ndemonstrated by Ismael et al.333 Sixteen\npotentially safer, more sustainable solvents were included during\nsolvent screening investigations including dipolar aprotic alternatives\nsuch as DMI, GVL, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, and\nether 2-MeTHF. It was found that aminocarbonylation proceeded\nwell in DMC while alkoxycarbonylation was successfully conducted\nin DMC and 2-MeTHF.333 Lastly, a\nvery recent report by Elorriaga and colleagues disclosed\na hybrid synthetic method in which an aluminum-catalyzed fixation\nof carbon dioxide in 2-MeTHF led to conversion of epoxides into tertiary\nalcohols.334 This process, catalyzed by\nAlEt2(κ2-bpzbdeape) (bpzbdeape = 1,1-bis(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethan-1-ol),\nresults in insertion of CO2 into one of the epoxide C–O\nbonds and subsequent ring expansion to form 5-membered cyclic carbonates\nin a near-quantitative yield. These cyclic carbonates, derived from\nthe structure of the starting epoxide, are then treated with 5 equiv\nof an alkyllithium reagent (e.g., EtLi), resulting in rapid conversion\nto the trialkyl alcohol. This methodology highlights an efficient\nmethod for the fixation of carbon dioxide to produce a range of highly\nsubstituted tertiary alcohols in one pot (Scheme 54).334 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution, or SNAr, is one of the most commonly used classes of reaction for\nsynthesis of aryl and heteroaryl ring systems, see Scheme 55.260 Because of the ease of reaction, including room temperature procedures,\nhigh-yielding transformations, and the ability to predict regioselectivity,335 the popularity of this reaction class has significantly\nincreased in the previous 30 years.260 Although\nthere are many examples using sustainable solvents in SNAr reactions, incidences using solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and THF\nare also prevalent within the literature.336,337 In the previous 5 years, a number of advances\nhave been made toward\nthe use of novel, sustainable solvents in nucleophilic aromatic substitution\nreactions (SNAr). In 2019, Szekely and co-workers discussed\nthe use of novel solvent PolarClean alongside other greener alternatives\n(GVL, Cyrene, and propylene carbonate) in a selection of reaction\nclasses including SNAr reactions.104 Using model reactions for the substitution of phenol or benzimidazole\non substrate bis(4-fluorophenyl) sulfone, comparisons between the\nsustainable solvents and more traditional alternatives of concern\n(DMAc, toluene) were explored, see Scheme 56. Using phenol, the more favorable alternatives\nperformed effectively compared to DMAc/toluene (86–92% compared\nto 70%) though were slightly less effective using benzimidazole (77–87%\ncompared to 97%), see Table 11. Studying the use of Cyrene-derived solvents such as\nthose falling\ninto the Cygnet class, Clark and colleagues at the University of York\nexplored the substitution of these solvents in nucleophilic aromatic\nfluorination reactions of pyridines.66 In\nthe study, which also involved use in other reaction classes, kinetic\ninvestigations in the fluorination of 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine using\na Cygnet 0.0 and a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents were carried\nout. Cygnet 0.0 resulted in higher reaction rates that MeCN and NMP,\nwith comparable rates to DMF.66 A small\nselection of publications in the previous 5 years have opted for a\nstraight solvent swap of the disfavored THF for the more sustainable\nalternative 2-MeTHF, mostly focusing on SNAr reactions\nfor medicinal chemistry applications. While investigating Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-couplings, Buchwald and Smith discovered that in a small number\nof cases when coupling secondary amines with the model substrate,\nthe reaction in 2-MeTHF proceeded effectively under noncatalyzed conditions.338 In the design of a greener synthetic route\nto an EGFR receptor inhibitor, McWilliams and co-workers from Pfizer\nsubstituted THF for 2-MeTHF in a key SNAr step, yielding\nthe desired product in 90% yield, see Scheme 57.339 A report by Parmentier et al.\nin 2016 demonstrated the utility\nof surfactant-based amphiphiles in the synthesis of a pharmaceutically\nrelevant API.340 Looking to enhance the\nfirst generation route for synthesis, the group explored the use of\nTPGS-750-M in water over the 5-step synthesis, with the primary step\ninvolving an SNAr reaction of an amine fragment and an\n(hetero)aryl electrophile (structures likely withdrawn from the publication\ndue to intellectual property restraints). For this SNAr\nstep, a switch from organic solvents to a surfactant–water\nsystem resulted in a slightly diminished yield of 75% compared to\n87%, but for the overall 5-step route, the process mass intensity\n(PMI) of the process was decreased by 32%.340 More recently, Berteina-Raboin and co-workers explored the\nuse\nof the widely available PEG-400 (polyethylene glycol) as a solvent\nin nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, see Scheme 58.341 The reaction was shown to perform effectively, using a range of\naliphatic and aromatic amines, on medicinally relevant substrate classes\nincluding imidazo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazines. For the wide ranging substrate scope, yields are\nreported in the range of 70–99%.341 Various PEG variants have also been successfully applied in many\nmetal-mediated reactions including oxidation, reduction, cross-coupling,\nand polymerization. This subject has been well reviewed by Colacino\net al.342 Often, organic solvents\ncan be replaced entirely from SNAr type chemistry. In 2013,\nWalsh et al. demonstrated that several\nSNAr reactions comprising heteroaryl chlorides such as\npyrimidine, pyrazine, and quinazoline could be conducted in water\nin the presence of KF. Surprisingly, several transformations that\nwere previously reported in the literature as requiring transition\nmetal catalysis were able to be conducted free from Pd.343 Organometallic-based\nreactions, such as those involving the use of alkyl lithium reagents,\nGrignard reagents, and metal hydride reductions, are commonly carried\nout in ethereal solvents and hydrocarbons due to the need for stability\nunder basic conditions.204,344 The most commonly\nused solvents within this class include diethyl ether, THF, and 1,4-dioxane,\nall of which are solvents of concern, see Figure 31.8 In recent\nyears, as a solution to the ongoing issues surrounding these solvents,\n2-MeTHF158,160 and CPME345 have\nboth been proposed as sustainable alternative solvents in a range\nof organometallic reactions, key examples of which will be discussed\nin this section. A number of commonly employed organometallic reagents\nare also now available as commercial preparations in alternative solvents\nsuch as 2-MeTHF.346 Organometallic reagents\nand their commonly employed ethereal solvents. 2-MeTHF\nhas been successfully utilized in a multitude of organometallic\nreactions, often acting as a “drop in” replacement for\nTHF or 1,4-dioxane. In 2010, Carbone et al. demonstrated that 2-MeTHF\ncould be used as solvent in asymmetric deprotonation reactions where\na chiral amine anion base is prepared in situ. Remarkably,\nthe chiral nature of the amine base is critical for enantioselectivity\nin asymmetric lithiation reactions when THF or 2-MeTHF are used as\nsolvent; anion bases derived from (−)-sparteine proceeded with\nlow enantioselectivity, whereas when a (+)-sparteine surrogate was\nemployed, excellent selectivity was observed.347 When MTBE was employed as solvent, excellent enantioselectivity\nwas observed for both sparteine bases, see Table 12 and Scheme 59. The selectivity is explained by the authors\nthrough a series of experiments investigating the solution phase dimerization\nand organization of the lithium base solvent complexes. The (+)-sparteine\nsurrogate used is (+)-(1R,2S,9S)-11-methyl-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7tridecane]. Mild, chemoselective N-TBS\nprotection of anilines\nhas been reported by Pace et al. using 2-MeTHF as a direct replacement\nfor THF. Under their optimized reaction conditions, TBS protection\nof aniline was conducted at 0 °C in just 30 min using MeLi and\nTBDMSCl in excellent yields (88–98%, 15 examples). Excellent\nchemoselectivity was also observed when iodo and bromo anilines were\nutilized as substrates; no lithium-halogen exchange was observed when\nusing 2-MeTHF as solvent but exchange did occur when using diethyl\nether. Finally, site selective TBS protection of aniline nitrogen\nover alkylamino nitrogen atoms was demonstrated, see Scheme 60. When using THF or diethyl\nether, a 1:1 mixture was observed. This remarkable selectivity has\nbeen proposed by the authors as being due to a reduction in the amount\nof highly polar amine dianion formed in 2-MeTHF due to the solvent’s\npolarity.348 Additionally, the authors\nundertook an examination of deprotection conditions showing that it\nwas possible to deprotect the TBS protected anilines in near quantitative\nyield in 2 h by simply stirring the compounds in a suspension of silica\ngel in an ethanol:water mixture (1:5). Note: −50 °C\nused here instead of 0 °C. The utility\nof 2-MeTHF in LiBr mediated selective 1,2-additions\nof organolithium reagents to α,β-unsaturated imines, ketones,\nand aldehydes to give a variety of allylic alcohols and amines has\nbeen demonstrated.349 Notably, no 1,4-addition\nproducts were detected by 1H NMR, and the reactions were\nconducted at 0 °C making this an attractively simple method.\nAnalogous reactions conducted in THF took longer and gave poorer yields\nwhen compared to 2-MeTHF (e.g., 6 h 79% yield vs 2 h quantitative\nyield for the 1,2 addition of MeLi to cyclohexenone), see Scheme 61. Other lithium base mediated reactions that have been successfully\nconducted in 2-MeTHF include preparations of γ-hydroxy-α,β-acetylenic\nesters using the base lithium tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP).350 Once more, Pace et al. have demonstrated the\nsuperior utility of 2-MeTHF through their exhaustive screening of\nhydrocarbon and ethereal solvents in the reaction of methyl-2-bromoacrylate\nwith benzaldehyde in the presence of a strong alkyllithium base, see Scheme 62. The 2-MeTHF gave\na 94% yield of the desired alcohol in just 1.5 h at −40 °C\ncompared to THF, which gave just 67% under the same conditions. Efficient access decorated four- and six-membered sulfur containing\nheterocycles (i.e., thietanes and thiopyrans) have also been achieved\nthrough a lithiation electrophile trapping strategy using 2-MeTHF\nas solvent, see Scheme 63. The 2-MeTHF was shown to improve regioselectivity considerably\nover THF.351 A wide range of benzylic and\naliphatic electrophiles were utilized, and varying degrees of electrophile\ndependent stereocontrol were observed. Other areas of organometallic chemistry in which 2-MeTHF has seen\nutility include zirconium chemistry such as that employing Schwartz’s\nreagent ((C5H5)2ZrHCl). Schwartz’s\nreagent in the presence of 2-MeTHF has been used to reduce isocyanates\nto formamides under mild conditions with excellent chemoselectivity\nand stereoretention of chiral substrates observed (room temperature,\n1 h), see Scheme 65.352 THF gave\nslightly poorer yields of about −5% during solvent screening\nreaction development. Similarly, Schwartz’s reagent can be\nutilized to reduce isothiocyanates to thioformamides.351 Electron withdrawing groups attached to the\naromatic isocyanates were also well tolerated including reactive functional\ngroups such as azo and azide motifs.353 The use of 2-MeTHF and the use of an in situ generated\nSchwartz reagent as the hydride source were crucial for obtaining\nhigh chemocontrol.354 Schwartz’s reagent\nis prepared in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and LiAl(O-t-Bu)3H, that is, Snieckus protocol. Subtle differences in the solubilizing and stabilizing\neffect of\n2-MeTHF have been effectively leveraged by Lelo et al., who have successfully\nemployed this solvent to promote α-elimination of lithium halide\nsalts to carbenoids, that is, Kirmse’s α-elimination.\nTaking advantage of the unique properties of 2-MeTHF, LiX salts have\nbeen degraded to carbenoids and reacted in situ with\nepoxides to give β-halohydrins. Employing THF or diethyl ether\nunder the same conditions helps to stabilize the lithium salts, and\nthe transformations were poorly accommodated by these more stabilizing\nsolvents.355 Other uses of ICH2X include the NaBH4-mediated reduction of diselenides\nin the presence of ICH2F to give α-fluoromethyl selenoethers.356 Synthesis of secondary amides from phenyl\nthiocarbamates and commercially\navailable Grignard reagents has been demonstrated by Mampuys et al.\nutilizing 2-MeTHF as solvent, see Scheme 66.357 Good to\nexcellent yields were observed across a wide variety of substrates\nincluding sterically hindered and electron-deficient compounds (Scheme 67). The Grignard reaction manifold\nrepresents a classical and key methodology\nfor C–C bond formation. Grignard reactions, at their simplest,\ninvolve the addition of an organomagnesium halide to a carbonyl\ncontaining molecule, forming a new C–C bond and an alcohol.\nThe reaction was discovered in 1900 by Victor Grignard, for which\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912.358 The reaction today is still widely employed and has even\nbeen conducted in the large scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and their intermediates.177 Grignard reactions have classically employed solvents of concern\nsuch as THF or diethyl ether, thus prompting the research group of\nZhang et al. to undertake a systematic study evaluating the performance\nof a variety of alternative and more sustainable solvents in Grignard-type\nreactions.177 It was demonstrated that\n2-MeTHF performed just as well or out-performed diethyl ether or THF\nin a wide variety of Grignard reactions including benzyl, aryl, and\nheteroaromatic Grignard reagents. CPME was also shown to be an appropriate\nsolvent when DIBAL-H instead of I2 was used as an initiator.\nA solvent comparison study for the formation of API tramadol was also\nconducted, see Scheme 64, with 2-MeTHF outperforming THF by +11% yield. After a performance\nevaluation and screening of solvents for a range of Grignard reactions,\nZhang et al. now recommend the use of 2-MeTHF as alternative solvent\nto Et2O and THF for the preparation of most Grignard reagents\nand their subsequent reactions, see Scheme 68. They noted that the use of 2-MeTHF was\nequal if not superior in suppressing the Wurtz coupling byproduct\nfrom benzyl Grignard reactions, see Table 13.177 The use of Reformatsky reagents in the large-scale synthesis of\nvarious enantiopure N-tert-butanesulfinyl trifluoromethyl\nβ-amino esters from bench-stable analogues of aliphatic and\naromatic trifluoromethyl N-tert-butanesulfinyl ketoimines\nwas reported by Grellepois, see Scheme 69. During optimization studies, it was found\nthat 2-MeTHF was the best solvent.359 The synthesis of enantioenriched\nalcohols via the Corey-Baskshi-Shibata\n(CBS) oxazaborolidine-mediated reduction of prochiral ketones was\ncarried out by Luisi and co-workers using a combination of flow technology\nand 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 70. The optimized conditions gave the desired asymmetric products\nin yields of up to 99% and 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), with a reaction\nduration 10 min.360 CPME, as discussed preciously in section 2, has been available\nin commercially useful\nquantities since 2005165 and has been utilized\nin a wide variety of reaction classes including organometallic mediated\ntransformations. A selection of examples highlighting some of the\nbreadth and scope of CPME employment in organometallic reactions will\nbe discussed in this section. In 2007, Okabayashi et al. developed\na facile method for the regio- and stereoselective preparation of\nketene trimethylsilyl acetals (KSAs) from t-butyl\nesters or ketoesters using strong bases such as LDA and NaHMDS, in\nconjunction with TMSCl, and CPME as solvent. The reactions were conducted\nunder mild conditions, 0–5 °C, 2.5 h and produced both\n(E)-KSAs and 1,3-bis(TMS)-KSAs, see Scheme 71.361 α-Oxygen and α -nitrogen-substituted t-butyl esters were also shown to be compatible with this methodology.\nDuring solvent screening for reaction condition optimization, it was\nshown that other ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, THF, 1,4-dioxane,\nand dimethoxyethane led to poor regioselectivity and C-silylation, whereas CPME by comparison outperformed all of these\nsolvents. CPME has also seen use as a\ncosolvent in conjunction with THF,\nsee Scheme 72. Takeda\net al. demonstrated that CPME was critical for a titanocene-mediated\nketone allylation strategy that gave access to alkyl systems containing\nadjacent stereocenters in high yield and high diastereoselectivity.362 CPME has also been used as a co-solvent (in\nconjunction with toluene) by researchers at Novartis who employed\nthe solvent as a stabilizer for a Grignard reagent during a reaction\nsequence.363 The stabilizing effect of CPME was once again\nexploited by Molander\net al. during their reaction optimization for the synthesis of azaborines.\nA 1:1 mixture of CPME:toluene was discovered to be optimum.364 Azaborines represent an important and emerging\nclass of potential isosteric replacements for traditional carbon containing\nheterocycles, and the methodology developed, Scheme 73, has allowed for facile synthesis using,\nat least in part, a more contemporary solvent. The Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is a classical\nmethod for the\nsynthesis of cyclopropanes from alkenes via insertion of a zinc carbene,\nsee Scheme 74. THF\nor diethyl ether is most often employed as solvent in this reaction\nmanifold, and in 2013, Fujii et al. conducted solvent screening to\ndetermine whether other alternative ethers could be used. It was demonstrated\nthat reactions conducted using CPME went to completion up to ten-times\nfaster than those in diethyl ether with no loss in product yield or\nselectivity. Yield improvements in some cases were also noted.365 In 2015, Pace et al. demonstrated that CPME was the optimum\nsolvent\nfor their synthesis of thioamides from the corresponding isothiocyanate\nand lithium reagent, see Scheme 75. Solvent screening showed CPME to be superior to traditional\nethers such as THF and diethyl ether and even outperformed 2-MeTHF\nin terms of yield. The methodology reported provides robust and efficient\naccess to secondary thioamides from commercially available isothiocyanates\nand includes examples where chiral isothiocyanates or organolithium\nreagents have been used to form enantiopure products with excellent\nselectivity. In 2016, a thorough investigation into the use\nof CPME in Grignard\nreactions was conducted by Kobayashi et al., see Scheme 76.345 It was shown that CPME can be used in place of THF to great effect\nand that DIBALH was the most effective method of activating the Mg\nwhen using CPME as solvent. Efficient solvent recycling of CPME was\nalso demonstrated with no loss of yield observed. Promisingly, CPME\nwas shown to be stable to Grignard reagents during long-term storage\nwith no solvent degradation observed. Furthermore, Grignard reagent\nstability in CPME was often in the order of many months; thus, CPME\ncould be used in commercial preparations of Grignard reagents.345 Ureas are used\nin agrochemicals, and in the pharmaceutical industry where they are\nfound in areas such as antibiotics, antimalarial compounds, antimicrobials,\nand many others. They have also been utilized as catalysts, ligands,\nand solvents, see Scheme 77. A greener, mild, and efficient\napproach for the synthesis of ureas,\nfrom isocyanates and secondary amines, was developed by Camp and co-workers\nusing the bioalternative solvent Cyrene, see Scheme 78.88 This method\nremoves the use of toxic solvents such as DMF, which has been used\nin the traditional synthesis of ureas. A simple workup procedure for\nthe removal of Cyrene was also established by the addition of water,\nwhich led to precipitation of the desired urea. The substrate scope\nof both the amine and isocyanate was investigated. Steglich\nesterification remains a commonly employed technique for the mild\nsynthesis of esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols or thiols.184,367 This methodology employs coupling reagents often encountered in\namide bond formation such as carbodiimides and relies heavily on either\nDCM or DMF as solvents of choice.8,367 Solvent-reagent\nselection guides for both ester and thioester synthesis have been\ndeveloped by Jordan et al. and effectively demonstrate the effective\nreplacement of dipolar aprotic solvents with safer, more sustainable\nalternatives, see Scheme 79. For the formation of thioesters from acids and thiols,\nit was found\nthat coupling reagent T3P in conjunction with solvent cyclopentanone\ngave good to excellent yields across a variety of building-block-like\nmolecules, often with rapid reaction times of just 1 h, see Scheme 79 (left). 2-MeTHF,\nEtOAc, DMC, and CPME were also shown to be viable alternatives, though\nless general in their applicability/compatibility to the substrates\nscreened.184 A solvent-reagent guide\nfor ester formation from alcohols and acids\nhas also been recently developed. In this study, a high-throughput\napproach allowed for the simultaneous identification of alternative\nsolvent DMC in conjunction with safer coupling reagent 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium\niodide (Mukaiyama’s reagent). Further optimized conditions\nwere identified from the initial screen and then successfully applied\nin the synthesis of a selection of building-block-like molecules,\nsee Scheme 79 (right).\nIn both studies, less desirable polar aprotic solvents were successfully\nreplaced with greener, safer, more sustainable alternatives. Steglich esterification in water has also been demonstrated by\nFattahi et al. using DIC as coupling reagent, though the methodology\nis limited to phenolic alcohols due to their lower pKa when compared to aliphatic alcohols in water.265 A range of peptide-based compounds are widely\nused globally, including\nclinically used hormones such as oxytocin, and peptide therapeutics.\nFrom 2015–2019, 208 new drugs were approved by the FDA, 15\nof which were peptides or peptide-containing molecules (7%).370 The increasing proportion of therapeutics falling\ninto the peptides category has been accompanied by a need for more\nsustainable methods for the solid phase synthesis of peptides (SPPS),\nsee Scheme 80. Commonly\nused solvents for SPPS fall within the reprotoxic dipolar aprotics\ncategory, being DMF, DMAc, and NMP.371 The\nchallenges in improving the sustainability in peptide synthesis and\npurification are well reviewed by Isidro-Llobet et al.372 Recently, a number of publications have aimed\nto move away from\nreprotoxic dipolar aprotic solvents in solid phase peptide synthesis,\nswitching to more sustainable alternatives. The work of Lawrenson\net al. has successfully demonstrated the use of propylene carbonate\nas a safer, more sustainable alternative to polar aprotic solvents\nsuch as DMF or NMP. In their publication, both SPPS and solution phase\nmethodology were successfully demonstrated using propylene carbonate\nas solvent with no significant impact on racemization of the amino\nacid (AA) observed. Synthesis of nonapeptide “Bradykinin”\nwas also demonstrated. NBP was identified by Novartis in 2018\nduring a systematic examination\nof 34 alternative solvents shortlisted as potential DMF replacements\nin SPPS.222 A number of parameters were\nexamined including solvent ability to swell resin, solubility of SPPS\nreagents, and reaction performance including Fmoc deprotection steps.\nNBP was successfully demonstrated as a viable drop-in replacement\nfor DMF; NBP was successfully used as the solvent during the SPPS\nsynthesis of an octapeptide with comparable yield and purity to that\nof DMF (93% yield NBP vs >99% DMF, 80% purity NBP vs 86% DMF).\nOne\nmajor point of difference was highlighted: NBP is more viscous than\nDMF (4.0 cP vs 0.8 cP) and makes for slower fluid transfer steps during\nsmaller scale SPPS operations.222 Two reports were published in 2020 in which the solvent NBP was\nused in place of traditional solvents. Kumar et al. have successfully\ndemonstrated the use of NBP as a replacement for DMF and NMP SPPS\noperations using both in situ activation and preactivation\nstrategies. Less racemization was observed for reactions conducted\nin NBP, and a reduction in the generation of side-products when forcing\nconditions were utilized was also observed. Thus, NBP has been demonstrated\nas a superior alternative to both DMF and NMP in this study.373 De la Torre et al. report the successful\nuse of NBP in an SPPS\nsequence employing problematic amino acid residue Fmoc-Arg (Pbf)–OH;\npbf = (2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl group).\nThe amino acid residue is particularly troublesome due to its propensity\nto react intramolecularly leading to δ-lactam side product.\nA systematic analysis of reaction conditions allowed for the identification\nof optimum conditions, and NBP was shown to be an excellent alternative\nsolvent to DMF, with levels of amino acid incorporation into the peptide\nbackbone approaching 100%. Purity of the crude peptides was also similar.374 From a safety perspective, it has been\nreported by Erny et al.\nthat the levels of HCN produced in DIC/Oxyma mediate amide bond forming\nreactions can be significantly reduced when a mixture of NBP:EtOAc\n1:4 is employed.375 In conjunction with\ndimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) as a HCN scrubbing additive, the authors\nsuggest that with further developments, the implementation of this\nmethodology combining greener solvents and HCN-free synthesis could\nbe applied to the industrial manufacturing of peptides. Other\nthan NBP, GVL has also been proposed as a potential alternative\nsolvent in SPPS. The group of Albericio and co-workers illustrated\nthat GVL could be utilized in polystyrene (PS)-based SPPS. GVL showed\nexcellent coupling efficiencies in both the synthesis of a pentapeptide\n(Aib-enkephalin) and decapeptide (Aib-ACP), with no major side products\nor ring opening products detected.376 A\nfollow-up to this work was published in 2019 demonstrating the effectiveness\nof GVL in Wang resin SPPS; DCM was effectively replaced as an alternative\nsolvent for the initial anchoring to the Wang resin. Subsequent elongation\nof the peptide was also successfully conducted in GVL with racemization\nand dipeptide formation found to be within acceptable levels.377 Both publications also note the compatibility\nof Fmoc residues in GVL. Most recently, Leko et al. have demonstrated\nthat a combination of EtOAc/CH3CN can be used in chlorotrityl\nchloride and 4-methylbenzhydryl bromide resin loading operations\nwith loading levels comparable to that when DCM, THF, 2-MeTHF, or\nDMF was utilized.378 In recent years,\nthere has been a significant expansion in the field of biocatalysis,\ncommonly using water as a solvent or cosolvent. However, there are\na number of problems associated with the use of water as a solvent\nin biocatalysis, even though it is readily available, is nonhazardous,\nand does not have the flammability or explosion risks associated with\norganic solvents.379 Many synthetically\nuseful reagents, those that are of interest in biocatalytic transformations,\nare poorly water-soluble, which in turn results in a requirement of\nextremely dilute reaction mixtures, leading to increased solvent use.\nThere has been a recent drive for discovery of enzymatic reactions\ncompatible with sustainable organic solvents, most notably 2-MeTHF380 and CPME.168 The most expansive class of enzymatic reaction using 2-MeTHF is that\nof hydrolases, mostly in stereoselective acylations for kinetic resolutions\nof racemates.381−383 In 2017, Secundo and co-workers reported\nthe use of 2-MeTHF in the esterification of a range of natural products\n(menthol, rac-sulcatol and rac-α-cyclogeraniol)\nusing a range of commercial lipases.384 2-MeTHF, as well as CPME, performed well compared to traditional\nsolvents such as toluene and MTBE, with high enantioselectivity. A\nsimilar enzymatic acylation of racemic benzoin in 2-MeTHF, reported\nby Alcántara and colleagues in 2011, using Pseudomonas\nstutzeri lipase (PSL) and Shvo’s catalyst, led to\nkinetic resolution over 48 h, in a 85% yield and 99% e.e. (Scheme 81).385 Numerous additional examples are also found\nwithin the literature using 2-MeTHF as an alternative bio-based solvent,\ntargeting selective acylations of glycosides.386−390 Away from kinetic resolutions, Pseudomonas stutzeri lipase (PSL) has additionally be used as an effective catalyst in\namination reactions of esters, reported by Wong et al. in 2011.391 Shown to form a wide range of alkyl and aryl\namides, 2-MeTHF was reportedly selected due to a high solubilizing\nability of the organic starting materials, with MTBE also shown to\nperform effectively in the transformation. A selection of papers\nusing 2-MeTHF as a bio-based solvent, for\naccessing chiral α-hydroxyketones through either carboligation392,393 or domino enzymatic reactions,394 have\nalso been reported. The first of which, by Domínquez de María\nin 2010, involved use of 2-MeTHF as a (co)solvent alternative to DMSO\nor MTBE for enantioselective C–C bond formation between aldehydes.\nCatalyzed by a thiamine diphosphate-dependent lyase (ThDP-Lyase),\nan efficient enantioselective carboligation of aldehydes to furnish\nchiral α-hydroxyketones was described, providing products in\n>90% yield and generally >95% e.e. (Scheme 82a). A similar report by Rother and co-workers\nin 2012 also used ThDP-Lyase for the umpolung carboligation\nof acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde, examining the relative product distribution\nof the eight possible enantiomeric products.393 (a) Carboligation of aldehydes\nto produce chiral α-hydroxyketones. (b) Domino enzymatic process\nfor the preparation of 2-HPP, with in situ generation\nof acetaldehyde via kinetic resolution. This\nwas further followed up in 2012 by a domino enzymatic cascade\nusing an aldehyde and butyrate or laurate substrate, in the presence\nof Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) and benzaldehyde\nlyase (BAL).394 An initial conversion of\nthe vinyl ester into acetaldehyde, followed by a subsequent C–C\nbond formation with benzaldehyde, catalyzed by BAL, furnished (R)-2-hydroxypropriophenone (2-HPP) in quantitative\nconversion and >99% e.e. (Scheme 82b). Although the majority of biocatalytic transformations\ncarried out\nin organic solvents such as 2-MeTHF fall under the hydrolases class\ndue to their high robustness, a small number of other enzymes are\nalso compatible. In 2014, metagenome screening by Kurokawa and colleagues\nidentified a dehydrogenase enzyme, homologous Leifsoniaadh alcohol\ndehydrogenase (HLADH), which was able to effectively reduce a selection\nof ketones, with high tolerance to 2-MeTHF, in excellent (generally\n>99%) enantiomeric excess.395 Similar\nketone\nreductions have been reported, for example, using YOL151W reductase396 and KREDs (Scheme 83).397 Other than 2-MeTHF, a solvent\n(or cosolvent) that has demonstrated\npotential within biocatalytic transformations is cyclopentyl methyl\nether (CPME). CPME, similar to 2-MeTHF, has proven effective in kinetic\nresolution, such as the one reported by González-Sabín\nand co-workers in 2017.398 As part of a\nkey step in the synthesis of Ivabradine, a drug used for the treatment\nof stable angina pectoris, alkoxycarbonylation kinetic resolution\nof an amine precursor was carried out using the lipase PSC-II and\ndiethylcarbonate, yielding the desired (S)-enantiomer\nin 30% yield, 92% e.e. (Scheme 84). The utility of CPME as a solvent in the reduction of imine-type\nfunctionalities, using IREDs (imine reductases), was reported by Rother\nand Maugeri in 2016.399 Reduction of cyclic\nC=N functionalities using whole cells containing Streptomyces\naurantiacus and Paenibacillus elgii B69\ngave an e.r. of >99:1 under micro aqueous reaction conditions (Scheme 85).\n\n## Amide Bond Formation\nThe amide moiety\nis abundant within drug molecules,259 and\namide coupling has been consistently highlighted as the most frequently\nemployed transformation in medicinal chemistry (Scheme 9, Scheme 10).260 Traditionally, amide\ncoupling has relied heavily on solvents with major regulatory issues\nsuch as dichloromethane and DMF, which are classed as solvents of\nconcern.44 On the basis of the importance\nof amide bond formation, it is pertinent that greener and more sustainable\nsolvent use should be explored whenever possible. Several examples of amide coupling reactions employing previously\ndiscussed sustainable alternatives to dipolar aprotics are discussed\nbelow. Recently, Camp and co-workers reported the synthesis of amides\nfrom acid chlorides and amines in the biobased solvent Cyrene.125 The substrate scope was investigated pertaining\nto both the acid chlorides and primary amines. Crucially, the addition\nof water allowed for precipitation of the product and facile isolation\nfrom the Cyrene solvent without the use of chromatography, see Scheme 9. Watson and co-workers\nhave also evaluated the use of Cyrene in the HATU-mediated synthesis\nof amides and peptides.119 It was found\nthat Cyrene was an effective replacement for DMF and NMP in the synthesis\nof lead-like molecules. Conditions were established that demonstrated\na broad functional group tolerance and broad generality after evaluating\n25 examples, with yields ranged from 63–100%, see Scheme 10. In 2017, Hunt\nand co-workers published an article comparing the utility of 2,2,5,5-tetramethyloxolane\n(TMO) in a series of reactions, one of being formation of an amide\nfrom phenylbutanoic acid and benzyl amine (Scheme 11), with traditional solvents\nsuch as toluene.103 In the studies, reaction\nkinetics analysis of the amide formation resulted in similar reaction\nrates to the effective toluene and p-cymene solvents,\nalthough the basicity (β) of TMO was similar to the less effective\nDMSO (Figure 28).\nAlso in this report is discussed the nature of ethers containing α-protons\nto the oxygen to form dangerous peroxides in solution, upon irradiation\nwith UV light. In a comparative irradiation experiment, traditional\nperoxide-forming ethers THF, 2-MeTHF, and diethyl ether formed varying\namounts of detectable peroxide over a period of six months, whereas\na solution of TMO stored under identical conditions formed no detectable\nperoxide. Reaction\nkinetic analysis for TMO (TMTHF)-mediated amide bond formation\nconducted by Byrne et al.103 Reproduced\nfrom ref (103) with\npermission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. Handa et al. have recently developed solvent-free methodology for\nfast and clean amide couplings in water that require no extraction,\nchromatography, or crystallization (Scheme 12).261 This is\nachieved by use of the l-proline-based amphiphile PS-750-M,\ndeveloped by the group.238 In the micelle\nof PS-750-M, the presence of 3° amides from the surfactant proline\nlinker structurally mimics DMF, NMP, and DMAc solvents. This allows\nextremely fast amide couplings, mediated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)\ncarbodiimide (EDC), rather than expensive and specialized coupling\nreagents. The conditions developed by the group result in the precipitation\nof the product and isolation by filtration. The methodology is also\nreproducible on different reaction scales. Mechanistic and kinetic\ninsights into PS-705-M mediated fast amide bond formation have also\nbeen provided.262 A similar approach to that of Handa et al. is that of the Lipshutz\ngroup, inventors of the α-tocopherol derived surfactant TPGS-750-M,55 who demonstrated in 2015 that amide bond formation\ncan be rapidly conducted in TPGS-750-M–water systems in high\nyields. Products are extracted from the surfactant–water system\nusing an organic solvent. The surfactant has been designed to be preferentially\nsoluble in aqueous layers leading to facile product recovery and ease\nof recyclability of the surfactant–water phase (5 cycles conducted)\nand low E-factors (organic solvent + water E factor = 7.8).263 Reaction times were typically 1–4 h,\nand yields of amino acid amide couplings to give dipeptides (19 compounds)\nranged from 84 to 99%. In 2013, Watson et al. published a solvent-reagent\nguide evaluating the use of greener alternatives to DMF and DCM for\namide bond formation. It was shown that reaction rates and yields\nfor alternative solvents such as dimethylcarbonate, EtOAc, and\n2-MeTHF were comparable to DCM and DMF and could be considered as\npractical alternatives for both academic and industrial use. CPME\nwas shown to be a poor alternative, most likely due to reaction mixtures\nbecoming heterogeneous as they progressed.264 Amidation in water using N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide\n(DIC) as coupling reagent has been effectively demonstrated by Fattahi\net al. with no requirement for surfactant additives.265 Both aromatic and aliphatic acids were shown to be compatible\nwith this methodology. Catalytic amide bond formation was reported\nby Coomber et al. in\n2019 using a combination of B(OCH2CF3)3 in tert-butyl acetate, see Scheme 13. Significantly, this methodology allows\nfor the coupling of unprotected amino acids in high yields. Scales\nof up to 100 mmol were demonstrated with product isolation achieved\nby resin catch and release protocols.266 Ultrafast amidation reactions using lithium\namides under aerobic\nconditions and ambient temperatures have recently been reported by\nFairley et al. under these conditions, amidation of ester starting\nmaterials. The reaction proceeds via C–O bond cleavage and\nis complete in just 20 s. Solvents employed were either 2-MeTHF or\nglycerol.267 High yields and good selectivity\nwere generally observed making this methodology an advancement in\naccessing carboxamides by sustainable means via air and moisture compatible\norganometallic chemistry. A further push toward substitution\nof regulated solvents used in\namidation reactions with more sustainable biobased solvents, such\nas p-cymene, was demonstrated by Clark and co-workers\nfrom the University of York in 2018 (Scheme 14).268 Discovery\nof a preferred alternative to toluene for this transformation (which\ncould also act as an alternative to dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMF) also removes concerns associated with reproductive toxicity.269 A direct comparison of yields for toluene and p-cymene in a silica-catalyzed amidation of carboxylic acids,\nacross a varied substrate scope of 13 amides, was performed. In the\nmajority of cases, p-cymene outperformed that of\ntoluene when carried out under reflux (bp 177 °C). This methodology\nhas further enhanced sustainability, with facile purification through\namide precipitation, recycling of solvents, and use of a reusable\nsolid-supported catalyst. Palladium\ncatalysis is used extensively in both industrial and academic synthetic\nchemistry laboratories as a powerful methodology for the formation\nof C–C bonds. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of organoboronic\nacids and their derivatives is the most frequently utilized palladium-catalyzed\nC–C bond forming reactions in the chemical industry, see Scheme 15.14 Traditionally, ethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and\nTHF or dipolar aprotics such as DMF are employed for a large proportion\nof these reactions.14 Owing to the frequent\nuse and importance of this reaction, there is great potential for\n“greener” solvent alternatives to have a significant\nimpact. Note that discussion surrounding the use of Suzuki-Miyaura\nreactions as a benchmark for the performance of new solvents suggests\nthat it is not the most informative reaction manifold.270 For example, cross-coupling can be successfully\nconducted in rapeseed oil and butter with both of these lipid-based\nsystems outperforming benchmark solvent DMF.271 Watson and co-workers developed a mild method\nfor the Suzuki-Miyaura\nreaction that employed Cyrene as a greener alternative to the commonly\nused dipolar aprotic solvents (Scheme 16).14 The reaction\nscope was extensively explored by varying both the organoboron nucleophile\nand aryl electrophile. The conditions developed demonstrated excellent\ngenerality and functional group tolerance. The group reported 57 examples\nwith yields ranging from 44 to 100%, from discovery to gram-scale\nreactions. Hunt et al. have explored the use of NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent\nfor Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 17.110 Yields for\na series of reactions performed in both NMP and NBP have been reported,\nto carry out a comparison, using a range of different substituted\naryl halides to explore the scope. Although the results showed that\nreactions using NMP as solvent gave better yields overall (76–90%\nfor model reactions utilizing 4-iodoacetophenone and a range\nof phenylboronic acids), reactions carried out in NBP still gave good\nyields (∼10% lower for the same model reaction), as seen in Table 5. However, the reactions\nhad not been optimized to specifically favor N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\nso there may also be potential to improve the performance of these\nreactions. Dimethyl isosorbide has been\ndemonstrated as an effective reaction\nmedium for several classical cross-coupling reactions. In 2018, Watson\net al. reported the use of DMI in several Suzuki-Miyaura reactions\n(12 substrates). In general, aromatics with various electron donating\nand withdrawing groups were tolerated as were variations in the electrophilic\ncomponent including vinyl groups, boronic acids, and pinacol esters.214 Reaction times were 1 h conducted at 60 °C\nwith 4 mol % Pd(dppf)Cl2, and yields ranged from 62 to\n>99%. Garg and co-workers have reported the nickel-catalyzed\nSuzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling between aryl halides and (hetero)aromatic boronic\nacids in a number of greener solvent alternatives.272 Initial solvent screening showed that EtOAc, iPrOH, 2-MeTHF,\nand t-amyl alcohol were all demonstrated to be excellent\nalternatives, see Scheme 18, to traditionally employed solvents such as toluene or 1,4-dioxane.\nThe reaction scope was further explored using 2-MeTHF and t-amyl alcohol as solvents. The scope was found to be broad\npertaining to both coupling partners, with heterocycles well tolerated\n(Scheme 18). The methodology\nwas demonstrated on multigram scales using low catalyst loadings (0.5–1.0\nmol % nickel) to provide desired products in reasonable to excellent\nyields. 2-MeTHF has also been successfully employed as reaction solvent\nin palladium–NHC-catalyzed amide and ester cleaving cross-coupling\nreactions.273 Following the emergence of eucalyptol as a sustainable,\nbioderived\nsolvent, the utility of it in cross-coupling reactions has been explored\nin a number of transformations by Berteina-Raboin and colleagues.205−207 When tested in palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling\nreactions of arylboronic acids with heteroaryl chlorides, eucalyptol\noutperformed reactions conducted in THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, with\nyields ranging from 44 to 99%. Reaction temperatures of 100 °C\nwere required for complete dissolution of reagents. The\nMizoroki-Heck cross-coupling, commonly referred to as the Heck cross-coupling,\ninvolves the reaction of an aryl halide with an alkene under Pd(0)/Pd(II)\ncatalysis. Common reaction solvents for the Heck reaction include\n1,4-dioxane, THF, and amide-based solvents such as DMF and DMAc, see Scheme 19. Although there\nare examples using more sustainable solvents such as water and acetonitrile,\nexpansion of the available green solvents for the transformation is\nunderway.110,214 Hunt et al. have explored the scope and limitations of the use\nof NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent for the Heck cross-coupling reaction,\nsee Scheme 20, in\naddition to Suzuki-Miyaura couplings.110 The group reported and compared the yields from a series of reactions\nperformed in both NMP and NBP. In summary, they found that the Heck\nreactions carried out in NBP gave comparable to or higher yields than\nthose carried out in NMP, see Table 6. This comparison has demonstrated that NBP was a viable\nreplacement to NMP as reaction solvent in the Heck cross-coupling\nreactions examined. Dimethyl isosorbide has also been\ndemonstrated as an effective\nreaction medium for the Mizoroki-Heck reaction by Watson et al.214 Optimized reaction conditions using 5 mol %\nPd(dppf)Cl2 were trialled on 12 substrates and showed that\nthe reaction proceeded well with aryl iodides and bromides facilitating\ncoupling of both electron poor and rich arenes with a variety of vinyl\nketones and acrylamides in 47–91% yield. Reactions were generally\nconducted at 80 °C for 1 h though some aryl bromide examples\nrequired heating at 115 °C for 24 h.214 Another alternative class of solvents shown to have utility\nin\nMizoroki-Heck cross-couplings reactions is that of cyclic carbonates,\nsee Figure 29. In\na study evaluating the use of a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents\nfor the transformation, Clark and colleagues demonstrated the effective\nuse of propylene and ethylene carbonate in the place of NMP and DMSO.107 In many cases, both cyclic carbonate solvents\nperformed as or more effectively than NMP across a wide substrate\nscope, tolerating substrates of various electronics.

Recently, Su et al.\nhave demonstrated that DMI could be effectively\nutilized in a Ni-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling of aryl bromides\nwith vinyl acetate (acting as a vinylating reagent).274 Moderate to excellent yields of the vinylated products\nwere observed across a wide and varied heteroaryl substrate scope,\nsee Scheme 21. The Sonogashira\ncross-coupling is a widely used palladium and copper-catalyzed process\nfor accessing functionalized alkyne species from terminal alkynes\nand aryl halides, see Scheme 22.275 Another powerful C–C\nbond forming reaction, the Sonogashira reaction is commonly performed\nin THF and DMF,276 both of which are problematic\ndue to peroxide formation and reprotoxicity, respectively. Because\nof the efficiency and widespread use of this reaction in both academia\nand industry, a search for greener solvent alternatives is highly\ndesirable. Cyrene has been successfully\nutilized by Watson et al. as reaction\nsolvent for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 23.127 Utilization of the safer, more sustainable Cyrene as an alternative\nto traditionally employed DMF127 was demonstrated\nacross a number of aryl and heteroaryl iodides and alkyne coupling\npartners. Broad tolerance to the optimized reaction conditions was\nobserved with yields of 65–99% generally reported, though yield\nvariability was observed for some electron deficient aryl bromides\n(28–99%). Further expansion of the methodology to Cacchi-type\nannulations furnished benzofuran and indole scaffolds in good to excellent\nyields (73–100%), see Scheme 24. Dimethyl isosorbide has been successfully utilized as\nreaction\nsolvent for the Sonogashira reaction by Watson et al. Twelve substrates\nwere synthesized using the same catalyst and base conditions as depicted\nin Scheme 23 (reactions\nwere conducted at 25 °C).214 A range\nof aryl iodides and bromides including electron rich and deficient\nexamples, and a number of functionalized alkynes including BMIDA and\nTIPS functionalities, were synthesized in 83–98% yields. One\nexample of a thiophenol derived alkyne was synthesized, though in\na lower yield of 65%.214 Cabri and\nco-workers have recently published an investigation into\nthe use of N-substituted-pyrrolidinone solvents,\nalong with a small number of others, as a reaction medium for the\nSonogashira coupling.276 Given the knowledge\nof the reprotoxicity problems associated with NMP,17 the safer and more sustainable species discussed, such\nas NBP (N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone) and NCP (N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidinone), were shown to outperform\nDMF and NMP following optimization of reaction conditions. In addition\nto the broad substrate scope (generally >90% isolated yields),\nthe\nmethodology was applied to the synthesis of Erlotinib, performing\na Sonogashira cross-coupling step in quantitative yield, without the\nneed for a CuI additive, see Figure 30.276 Yield comparison for\nmodel Sonogashira reaction conducted by Cabri\net al. using a variety of NMP/DMF drop-in replacements.276 In addition to the previously\nmentioned explorations of the utility\nof eucalyptol as a solvent in palladium-catalyzed processes, it was\nalso shown to be effective in Sonogashira cross-couplings.277 A slightly different system to regular Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, utilizing Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 and\nPCy3, without addition of CuI, furnished a range of cross-coupled\nproducts in moderate to good yields.277 It was noted that the cross-coupling of any heterocycles containing\nfree amine functionality, such as 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine is ineffective when using eucalyptol\nas the solvent; further investigations are required to optimize this\nprocess such that yields are comparable to those obtained using traditional\nSonogashira solvents such as DMF. Buchwald-Hartwig\namination is a widely employed cross-coupling strategy used for the\nformation of C–N bonds, see Scheme 25. Commonly used for substrates that are\nless reactive to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the palladium-catalyzed\ntransformation is also known to perform well with oxygen and sulfur\nnucleophiles.278,279 1,4-Dioxane is commonly utilized\nas reaction solvent for these transformations, and 1,4-dioxane has\nserious issues and is regarded as a solvent of concern.280 A number of strategies\nto overcome this issue include reactions\nconducted solvent-free,281 in water,282 or using water–surfactant systems.55 In 2014, the Lipshutz group published methodology\ndescribing Buchwald-Hartwig amination using the TPGS-750-M surfactant–water\nsystem, see Scheme 26. In 2020, Manikandan and co-workers\nopted for the use of 2-MeTHF\nin the synthesis of a triazolo-pyridazine-6-yl-substituted via a Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-coupling.283 The 2-MeTHF was used\nas the solvent in the final stage of the synthesis for 12 medicinally\nrelevant antidiabetic compounds, and yields were reported in the range\nof 92–98% using a catalytic combination of 10 mol % Pd2(dba)3/XPhos, in the presence of NaOtBu at room temperature for 4 h, see Scheme 27. The use of a surfactant however is not always necessary, and aqueous\nsingle or two-phase systems have been known in the Pd-catalyzed amination\nmanifold.284 Further exploration into aqueous\nsystems has also been conducted and was well documented by Buchwald\net al. in 2003.285 Water has also\nbeen successfully utilized as reaction solvent in\nrelated Cu-catalyzed Ullman-type reactions,286 as have other safer solvents such as tBuOH.287 Solvent-free examples are also known.288 Bio-based solvent eucalyptol has also been studied\nfor its potential\nuse as solvent in the Buchwald-Hartwig amination, see Scheme 28. A number of model reactions\nwere examined encompassing a variety of bromoarenes and amines and\nanilines. Moderate to excellent yields were obtained (43–99%),\nin many cases better than the reported yields for the analogous reaction\nconducted in a conventional dipolar aprotic solvent.289 Ma et al. have demonstrated\nthat tBuOH could be\neffectively used as an alternative to 1,4-dioxane in the cross-coupling\nof amino acid esters with aryl bromides and chlorides, see Scheme 29.290 The methodology was not just limited to α-amino acids\nbut also included β-, γ-, and δ-, proteinogenic,\nand nonproteinogenic amino acids. Products were prepared generally\nin moderate to high yields with retention of optical activity. Other\nexamples utilizing tBuOH in Pd catalyzed C–N\nhave also been reported,291 and alcohols,\nsuch as iPrOH, have also seen use in Pd-catalyzed\nC–N and C–O bond forming reactions.292 Solvent-free, ball milling conditions have been described\nby Shao et al. in 2018.293 A solvent selection guide for conducting acyl Buchwald-Hartwig\ntransamidation reactions has recently been compiled by Lei et al.\nIn their study, an exhaustive solvent screen of alternative solvents\nhas been conducted including 2-MeTHF, CPME, GVL, anisole, and p-cymene, see Scheme 30.294 1,2-Dimethoxyethane\nwas used as a benchmark solvent, giving 86% yield in the same transformation.\nBoth 2-MeTHF and MTBE showed excellent generality and applicability\nacross a wide range of transamidation coupling partners demonstrated\nthrough a substrate screen consisting of a variety of anilines and\namides bearing EDGs and EWGs. Thus, dipolar aprotics of concern in\nthese reactions such as THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane can be effectively\nreplaced by a drop-in alternative.294 Because of\nthe widespread use of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, and variants thereof,\nin synthetic and medicinal chemistry,14 and the requirement for a boronic acid or boronate coupling partner,\nsustainable methods for accessing these moieties are highly desirable.\nTraditional methods for preparation of boronic acids and boronates,\nsuch as the Miyaura borylation (Scheme 31), require dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMSO, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane.295 Recently, advancements have been made toward more sustainable\nsolvents\nfor borylation reactions, with cyclic ethers and cyclic ketones being\nused as substitutes. A recent publication by Frantz and co-workers\ndescribes a sustainable method for accessing arylboronic acids from\npseudohalides and B2(OH)4 using a 0.01 mol %\npalladium catalyst loading in a 1:1 mixture of 2-MeTHF and MeOH, see Scheme 32.296 Also described is a direct one-pot conversion of aryl halide\nto the boronic acid diethanolamine (DEA) adduct, providing synthesis\nof boronate species less susceptible to protodeboronation.297 This transformation is well-tolerated for aryl\nand (hetero)aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides, with yields ranging\nfrom 60–85%, on the choice of catalyst, (AtaPhos)2PdCl2 or XPhos-Pd-G3. The effectiveness of the methodology\nis demonstrated by a one-pot tandem borylation-Suzuki sequence, furnishing\na diverse range of C–C coupled products with no more than 2\nmol % palladium used for the overall two-step process. Many more examples\nof greener palladium-catalyzed borylations of aryl halides using B2(OH)4 or B2pin2 are known\nin 2-MeTHF298 and CPME.299 Although not as widely used as aryl and hetero(aryl)boronic\nacids and boronates, alkenyl boronates have important applications\nin Diels–Alder cycloadditions, as precursors to cyclopropyl\nboronates, and as effective radical acceptors.300 Recently, a number of publications have highlighted the\nuse of sustainable solvents in borylation reactions of alkynes, both\nrhodium301 and copper-catalyzed.302 A publication by Hutzler and co-workers in\n2017, outlining routes to the synthesis of herbicides, included a\nrhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with HBpin, with a solvent\nchoice of cyclohexanone.301 The reaction,\ncarried out below room temperature (18 °C), yielded the desired Z-alkene in 52% yield after 2 h (Scheme 33). Similarly, a publication by Woźniak and co-workers in 2019,\nshowcasing the utility of copper-NHC complexes containing sulfone\nand sulfoxide side-chains, describes a low catalyst loading (0.05\nmol %) hydroboration of alkynes, using CPME as the solvent, with a\nMeOH additive (10:1), see Scheme 34.302 In this instance, CPME\noutperforms both isopropanol and toluene, and the catalytic system\napplies to both alkynes (yielding alkenyl boronates) and alkenes (yielding\nalkyl boronates). Yields for all substrates studied are in excess\nof 95%, proving the methodology a very powerful and sustainable way\nto hydroborate alkynes and alkenes. In addition to solvent swaps to\nCPME, 2-MeTHF, and cyclohexanone, MTBE has also been shown to be highly\neffective in borylation sequences. Reported in 2009, Marder and co-workers\nutilized the solvent in a one-pot C–H borylation/Suzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling sequence, a transformation shown to be highly effective\nfor both aryl and heteroaryl substrates.174 Borylation in protic solvents such as MeOH303 and EtOH304 has also been reported including\nin the 2020 report on transition metal-free borylation of aryl halides\nusing bis-boronic acid in MeOH.305 The direct\nactivation and functionalization of C–H bonds, which avoids\nthe installation of intermediate functional groups, is both step-\nand atom-efficient, see Scheme 35. However, the sustainability of C–H activation\nis hindered (especially for large-scale chemistry) by numerous factors,\none of these being the introduction of safer, greener, and more sustainable\nsolvents. In many examples of chemistry involving C–H activation,\ngreen solvents have been too easily overlooked in preference to solvents\nsuch as THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, which have been frequently used.306 The inclusion of safer solvents such as 2-MeTHF\n(and exploring less conventional PEG or aqueous-micellar systems)\nduring reaction optimization and solvent screening is therefore critical\nif the field of C–H activation is to migrate away from solvents\nof concern. Reviews on the subject of emerging unconventional organic\nsolvents for C–H bond activation have been published in 2019\nby Gandeepan et al.,307 in 2020 by Yu et\nal.,308 and in 2021 by Dhawa et al.309 and Dalton et al.306 We direct the reader toward these bodies of work for further information\nand specific examples. The 2-MeTHF was used as a replacement to THF and 1,4-dioxane by\nAckerman and co-workers in a mild C–H activation of allenes\nusing a Fe(0) phosphine catalyst (Scheme 36).310 Across\na selection of aryl substrates containing an α-ketone directing\ngroup, efficient C–H functionalization using Fe(PMe3)4 yielded a diverse range of products in good to excellent\nyields. Also demonstrated was a tolerability of hydroxyl, amino, and\nalkoxycarbonyl moieties, in addition to mechanistic and computational\ninvestigations. The bioderived solvent eucalyptol has also been shown to have utility\nas a solvent for direct C–H arylations by Berteina-Raboin and\ncolleagues.277 Following synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines from the corresponding 2-aminopyridine\nand 2-bromoacetophenone derivatives, Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed\ndirect C–H arylation at the C-3 position using bromobenzene\nin eucalyptol yielded the desired arylated product in 60% (5 mol %\ncat.) and 61% yields (10 mol % cat.) after 24 h at 150 °C, see Scheme 37. Other bio-based\nsolvents such as cumene have also been promoted as a potential solvent\nfor C–H bond activation chemistry.308 A regioselective C–H functionalization of 1,2,3-triazoles\nin GVL was accomplished by Vaccaro and co-workers in continuous flow,\nsee Scheme 38. Across\n8 substrates, excellent yields (79–91%) of the cyclized product\nwere obtained, with solvent recovery and reuse, without further purification,\nalso demonstrated.311 Kakiuchi and co-workers developed a Ru-catalyzed stereoselective\nC–H arylation of ortho-methoxylated acetophenones and C–H\nmonoarylation of ortho-unsubstituted acetophenones in high yields\nusing cyclohexanone as solvent, see Scheme 39. Note: styrene was utilized as a necessary\nadditive to selectively provide monoarylation.312,313 Aqueous surfactant systems such as TPGS750M-H2O have\nalso been successfully utilized in ruthenium-catalyzed C–H\narylation reactions.314 PEG-based systems have been demonstrated as promising alternatives\nto conventional solvents as evidenced by Ackermann et al., who first\nshowed in 2009 that PEG-20000 could be used as solvent for either\nRu- or Pd-catalyzed direct arylation chemistry.315 This discovery has led to other PEG-derived systems such\nas that demonstrated by Reddy et al.316 who showed that PEG-400 was an excellent solvent for Cu-mediated\ncross-coupling of oxadiazoles with dibromoalkenes, see Scheme 40. When conventional\nsolvents such as CH3CN and DCM were screened instead of\nthe PEG, no reaction took place. The t-butyl carbamate (Boc)\ngroup is a common protecting group for amines,\nmost often utilized in multistep syntheses due to its stability under\na wide range of reaction conditions. One of the most common methods\nof deprotection typically employs 4 M HCl in 1,4-dioxane, a solvent\nit would be good to replace when possible, see Scheme 41. Commercially available alternatives to 1,4-dioxane\npreparations\nof HCl are available in safer, more sustainable solvents including\nethereal alternative CPME.317 Given the\nincreasing availability of HCl solutions in more sustainable solvents,\nit is recommended that alternative mixtures are considered before\nopting to use HCl in 1,4-dioxane. Several examples throughout the\nliterature demonstrate the utility of more sustainable methods for\nBoc deprotections, as part of lengthy syntheses. As part of\nthe design and testing of a sustainable methodology\nfor an improved Pinner reaction in CPME, Torisawa and co-workers discuss\nthe use of a 4 M solution of HCl in CPME for the deprotection of a\nBoc-protected amino acid derivative.318 Stirring of the derivative for 6 h at 0 °C provided the desired\ndeprotected amine in 97% yield, with the workup procedure also employing\nthe greener solvent. A common alternative acidic medium for the deprotection\nof Boc groups involves the use of CF3CO2H, trifluoroacetic\nacid (TFA). The use of TFA within a sustainable solvent was demonstrated\nas part of a peptide coupling by North et al. in 2017, in which the\nfinal Boc deprotection step used a solution of TFA in propylene carbonate,\nsee Scheme 42.319 Use of this combination provided sequential\ndeprotection yields between 80 and 99% yields in the three individual\nBoc deprotection steps in the multistep synthesis of tetrapeptides. An additional example demonstrating the deprotection of a Boc group\nwas reported in a Pfizer patent in 2005.320 Instead of using TFA or HCl, a biphasic mixture of sodium tert-butoxide in H2O/2-MeTHF provided improved\nconditions for the deprotection of a range of heterocyclic substrates\nwith medicinal applications, see Scheme 43.158 Aldehydes, amides, esters, and carboxylic\nacids are abundant groups\nin synthetic organic chemistry, whether as part of a reaction intermediate\nor pharmaceutically relevant scaffold. Traditional methods for the\npreparation of such species include hydroformylations of alkenes and\namide couplings, to name a few, which often require toxic heavy metals,321 pyrophoric organometallic reagents,322 or allergenic amide coupling reagents.323 In recent years there has been a shift toward\ncatalytic methodologies including palladium-catalyzed formylations\nand carbonylations of aryl halides using carbon monoxide gas or surrogates\nthereof.324 Unfortunately, use of the gas\nis often accompanied by the use of dipolar aprotic solvents such as\nDMF,325 see Schemes 44 and 45, or 1,4-dioxane,326 see Scheme 46, to aid the solubility of the gas in the reaction\nmedium.327 Recently, there has been interest in substituting reprotoxic dipolar\naprotic solvents with more sustainable alternatives for carbonylation\nreactions. One of the alternative solvents for such transformations\nhas been the cellulose-derived solvent GVL. In 2016, initial exploratory\nwork into the use of biomass-derived solvents by Mika and colleagues\nrevealed the utility of GVL in the aminocarbonylation of aryl\nhalides under CO(g), see Scheme 47.328 In a system catalyzed\nby Pd(OAc)2/PPh3, it was shown that a mixture\nof the carboxamide and ketocarboxamide products could be obtained,\nand relative ratio of the ketocarboxamide could be favored by\nincreasing of CO(g) pressure, see Table 7.328 Following\non from this initial work, the group later published\na palladium-catalyzed carbonylative esterification of aryl iodides\nwith a wide range of alcohols in 2020.329 Again using GVL, the transformation provided a wide range of ester\nproducts with significantly improved yields compared to the previous\naminocarbonylation,328 ranging from\n39 to 99% with phenol coupling partners and 13–99% with alkyl\nalcohol coupling partners, see Scheme 48.329 In 2019, Schwab and co-workers\nreported a simple and efficient\naminocarbonylation process to access 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides\nfrom the related heteroaryl iodide species.330 The Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed process involved in situ generation of CO(g) using a combination of H2SO4 and HCO2H within CO-ware equipment.\nUtilizing the sustainable solvent dimethyl carbonate, a variety of\nfunctionalized 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides were produced, with yields\nranging from 33 to 98% (Scheme 49).330 In the area of carboxylation reactions, in 2015, Levacher\nand co-workers\nreported a sustainable carboxylation of organic (heteroaryl, alkenyl,\nand allyl) halides in 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 50.331 Using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl formate as a CO2(g)\nsurrogate, and in the process eliminating the requirement for a high\nCO2-solubilizing dipolar aprotic solvent and opting for\nthe use of 2-MeTHF, a wide range of N-hydroxysuccinimide\nesters were accessible (Scheme 50). The methodology was shown to be effective in the\ncarboxylation of a functionalized quinoline intermediate in the preparation\nof a number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, with\nthe transformation progressing in 82% isolated yield.331 Metal-catalyzed hydroamination of styrenes has recently been reported\nby Mulks et al., see Scheme 51. In their work, the conventional wisdom of air- and moisture-free\norganometallic reactions is challenged by their demonstration of hydroamination\nof aryl alkenes in 2-MeTHF using lithium amides, see Table 8. Reactions were open to air\nand moisture and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Yields were\nmoderate to excellent with some incompatibility observed when using\nstyrenes containing aryl halide moieties.332 Remarkably, the presence of adventitious moisture was shown to be\nbeneficial and not detrimental. Reactions were accelerated by moisture,\nwhich generated free amine in situ at a steady rate.332 Sodium amides were also shown to be compatible\nwith the methodology. In 2020, a publication by Gevorgyan et al.\ninvestigated the utility\nof newly discovered biomass-sourced solvents in carboxylation reactions.208 In an overall transformation for the hydrocarboxylation\nof alkenes, via a boronate species from an initial hydroboration with\n9-BBN, sustainable solvents including eucalyptol, dimethyl isosorbide\n(DMI), and GVL were screened, see Scheme 52. Given that the process occurs via a boronate\nspecies, the effectiveness of the secondary carboxylation of boronic\nacid pinacol esters, Bpins, was also explored. For the overall hydrocarboxylation\nof 4-methylstyrene, 2-MeTHF, eucalyptol, DMI, and GVL were all found\nto outperform dipolar aprotics of concern including THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nsee Table 9. The hydroboration\nmethodology was not restricted to just benzylic alkenes, that is,\nstyrenes.208 For the conversion of phenyl Bpin to the corresponding phenyl carboxylic\nacid, of the general type depicted in Scheme 53, DMI was found to outperform THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nwith 2-MeTHF and (+)-rose oxide also notably performing above 70%\nyield (Table 10).\nIn addition to these two reactions, the solvents were comparatively\nscreened for numerous other carboxylation processes including transition\nmetal-catalyzed carboxylations (copper, zirconium, iron, and nickel).208 The Cu-catalyzed carboyxylation methodology\nwas further applied toward the synthesis of active pharmaceutical\ningredients Fenoprofen (60% yield) and Flurbiprofen (53% yield). Pd-catalyzed alkoxy- and amino-carbonylation and aryl bromide/boronic\nacid carbonylation in greener more sustainable solvents has been recently\ndemonstrated by Ismael et al.333 Sixteen\npotentially safer, more sustainable solvents were included during\nsolvent screening investigations including dipolar aprotic alternatives\nsuch as DMI, GVL, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, and\nether 2-MeTHF. It was found that aminocarbonylation proceeded\nwell in DMC while alkoxycarbonylation was successfully conducted\nin DMC and 2-MeTHF.333 Lastly, a\nvery recent report by Elorriaga and colleagues disclosed\na hybrid synthetic method in which an aluminum-catalyzed fixation\nof carbon dioxide in 2-MeTHF led to conversion of epoxides into tertiary\nalcohols.334 This process, catalyzed by\nAlEt2(κ2-bpzbdeape) (bpzbdeape = 1,1-bis(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethan-1-ol),\nresults in insertion of CO2 into one of the epoxide C–O\nbonds and subsequent ring expansion to form 5-membered cyclic carbonates\nin a near-quantitative yield. These cyclic carbonates, derived from\nthe structure of the starting epoxide, are then treated with 5 equiv\nof an alkyllithium reagent (e.g., EtLi), resulting in rapid conversion\nto the trialkyl alcohol. This methodology highlights an efficient\nmethod for the fixation of carbon dioxide to produce a range of highly\nsubstituted tertiary alcohols in one pot (Scheme 54).334 Nucleophilic aromatic substitution, or SNAr, is one of the most commonly used classes of reaction for\nsynthesis of aryl and heteroaryl ring systems, see Scheme 55.260 Because of the ease of reaction, including room temperature procedures,\nhigh-yielding transformations, and the ability to predict regioselectivity,335 the popularity of this reaction class has significantly\nincreased in the previous 30 years.260 Although\nthere are many examples using sustainable solvents in SNAr reactions, incidences using solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and THF\nare also prevalent within the literature.336,337 In the previous 5 years, a number of advances\nhave been made toward\nthe use of novel, sustainable solvents in nucleophilic aromatic substitution\nreactions (SNAr). In 2019, Szekely and co-workers discussed\nthe use of novel solvent PolarClean alongside other greener alternatives\n(GVL, Cyrene, and propylene carbonate) in a selection of reaction\nclasses including SNAr reactions.104 Using model reactions for the substitution of phenol or benzimidazole\non substrate bis(4-fluorophenyl) sulfone, comparisons between the\nsustainable solvents and more traditional alternatives of concern\n(DMAc, toluene) were explored, see Scheme 56. Using phenol, the more favorable alternatives\nperformed effectively compared to DMAc/toluene (86–92% compared\nto 70%) though were slightly less effective using benzimidazole (77–87%\ncompared to 97%), see Table 11. Studying the use of Cyrene-derived solvents such as\nthose falling\ninto the Cygnet class, Clark and colleagues at the University of York\nexplored the substitution of these solvents in nucleophilic aromatic\nfluorination reactions of pyridines.66 In\nthe study, which also involved use in other reaction classes, kinetic\ninvestigations in the fluorination of 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine using\na Cygnet 0.0 and a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents were carried\nout. Cygnet 0.0 resulted in higher reaction rates that MeCN and NMP,\nwith comparable rates to DMF.66 A small\nselection of publications in the previous 5 years have opted for a\nstraight solvent swap of the disfavored THF for the more sustainable\nalternative 2-MeTHF, mostly focusing on SNAr reactions\nfor medicinal chemistry applications. While investigating Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-couplings, Buchwald and Smith discovered that in a small number\nof cases when coupling secondary amines with the model substrate,\nthe reaction in 2-MeTHF proceeded effectively under noncatalyzed conditions.338 In the design of a greener synthetic route\nto an EGFR receptor inhibitor, McWilliams and co-workers from Pfizer\nsubstituted THF for 2-MeTHF in a key SNAr step, yielding\nthe desired product in 90% yield, see Scheme 57.339 A report by Parmentier et al.\nin 2016 demonstrated the utility\nof surfactant-based amphiphiles in the synthesis of a pharmaceutically\nrelevant API.340 Looking to enhance the\nfirst generation route for synthesis, the group explored the use of\nTPGS-750-M in water over the 5-step synthesis, with the primary step\ninvolving an SNAr reaction of an amine fragment and an\n(hetero)aryl electrophile (structures likely withdrawn from the publication\ndue to intellectual property restraints). For this SNAr\nstep, a switch from organic solvents to a surfactant–water\nsystem resulted in a slightly diminished yield of 75% compared to\n87%, but for the overall 5-step route, the process mass intensity\n(PMI) of the process was decreased by 32%.340 More recently, Berteina-Raboin and co-workers explored the\nuse\nof the widely available PEG-400 (polyethylene glycol) as a solvent\nin nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, see Scheme 58.341 The reaction was shown to perform effectively, using a range of\naliphatic and aromatic amines, on medicinally relevant substrate classes\nincluding imidazo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazines. For the wide ranging substrate scope, yields are\nreported in the range of 70–99%.341 Various PEG variants have also been successfully applied in many\nmetal-mediated reactions including oxidation, reduction, cross-coupling,\nand polymerization. This subject has been well reviewed by Colacino\net al.342 Often, organic solvents\ncan be replaced entirely from SNAr type chemistry. In 2013,\nWalsh et al. demonstrated that several\nSNAr reactions comprising heteroaryl chlorides such as\npyrimidine, pyrazine, and quinazoline could be conducted in water\nin the presence of KF. Surprisingly, several transformations that\nwere previously reported in the literature as requiring transition\nmetal catalysis were able to be conducted free from Pd.343 Organometallic-based\nreactions, such as those involving the use of alkyl lithium reagents,\nGrignard reagents, and metal hydride reductions, are commonly carried\nout in ethereal solvents and hydrocarbons due to the need for stability\nunder basic conditions.204,344 The most commonly\nused solvents within this class include diethyl ether, THF, and 1,4-dioxane,\nall of which are solvents of concern, see Figure 31.8 In recent\nyears, as a solution to the ongoing issues surrounding these solvents,\n2-MeTHF158,160 and CPME345 have\nboth been proposed as sustainable alternative solvents in a range\nof organometallic reactions, key examples of which will be discussed\nin this section. A number of commonly employed organometallic reagents\nare also now available as commercial preparations in alternative solvents\nsuch as 2-MeTHF.346 Organometallic reagents\nand their commonly employed ethereal solvents. 2-MeTHF\nhas been successfully utilized in a multitude of organometallic\nreactions, often acting as a “drop in” replacement for\nTHF or 1,4-dioxane. In 2010, Carbone et al. demonstrated that 2-MeTHF\ncould be used as solvent in asymmetric deprotonation reactions where\na chiral amine anion base is prepared in situ. Remarkably,\nthe chiral nature of the amine base is critical for enantioselectivity\nin asymmetric lithiation reactions when THF or 2-MeTHF are used as\nsolvent; anion bases derived from (−)-sparteine proceeded with\nlow enantioselectivity, whereas when a (+)-sparteine surrogate was\nemployed, excellent selectivity was observed.347 When MTBE was employed as solvent, excellent enantioselectivity\nwas observed for both sparteine bases, see Table 12 and Scheme 59. The selectivity is explained by the authors\nthrough a series of experiments investigating the solution phase dimerization\nand organization of the lithium base solvent complexes. The (+)-sparteine\nsurrogate used is (+)-(1R,2S,9S)-11-methyl-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7tridecane]. Mild, chemoselective N-TBS\nprotection of anilines\nhas been reported by Pace et al. using 2-MeTHF as a direct replacement\nfor THF. Under their optimized reaction conditions, TBS protection\nof aniline was conducted at 0 °C in just 30 min using MeLi and\nTBDMSCl in excellent yields (88–98%, 15 examples). Excellent\nchemoselectivity was also observed when iodo and bromo anilines were\nutilized as substrates; no lithium-halogen exchange was observed when\nusing 2-MeTHF as solvent but exchange did occur when using diethyl\nether. Finally, site selective TBS protection of aniline nitrogen\nover alkylamino nitrogen atoms was demonstrated, see Scheme 60. When using THF or diethyl\nether, a 1:1 mixture was observed. This remarkable selectivity has\nbeen proposed by the authors as being due to a reduction in the amount\nof highly polar amine dianion formed in 2-MeTHF due to the solvent’s\npolarity.348 Additionally, the authors\nundertook an examination of deprotection conditions showing that it\nwas possible to deprotect the TBS protected anilines in near quantitative\nyield in 2 h by simply stirring the compounds in a suspension of silica\ngel in an ethanol:water mixture (1:5). Note: −50 °C\nused here instead of 0 °C. The utility\nof 2-MeTHF in LiBr mediated selective 1,2-additions\nof organolithium reagents to α,β-unsaturated imines, ketones,\nand aldehydes to give a variety of allylic alcohols and amines has\nbeen demonstrated.349 Notably, no 1,4-addition\nproducts were detected by 1H NMR, and the reactions were\nconducted at 0 °C making this an attractively simple method.\nAnalogous reactions conducted in THF took longer and gave poorer yields\nwhen compared to 2-MeTHF (e.g., 6 h 79% yield vs 2 h quantitative\nyield for the 1,2 addition of MeLi to cyclohexenone), see Scheme 61. Other lithium base mediated reactions that have been successfully\nconducted in 2-MeTHF include preparations of γ-hydroxy-α,β-acetylenic\nesters using the base lithium tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP).350 Once more, Pace et al. have demonstrated the\nsuperior utility of 2-MeTHF through their exhaustive screening of\nhydrocarbon and ethereal solvents in the reaction of methyl-2-bromoacrylate\nwith benzaldehyde in the presence of a strong alkyllithium base, see Scheme 62. The 2-MeTHF gave\na 94% yield of the desired alcohol in just 1.5 h at −40 °C\ncompared to THF, which gave just 67% under the same conditions. Efficient access decorated four- and six-membered sulfur containing\nheterocycles (i.e., thietanes and thiopyrans) have also been achieved\nthrough a lithiation electrophile trapping strategy using 2-MeTHF\nas solvent, see Scheme 63. The 2-MeTHF was shown to improve regioselectivity considerably\nover THF.351 A wide range of benzylic and\naliphatic electrophiles were utilized, and varying degrees of electrophile\ndependent stereocontrol were observed. Other areas of organometallic chemistry in which 2-MeTHF has seen\nutility include zirconium chemistry such as that employing Schwartz’s\nreagent ((C5H5)2ZrHCl). Schwartz’s\nreagent in the presence of 2-MeTHF has been used to reduce isocyanates\nto formamides under mild conditions with excellent chemoselectivity\nand stereoretention of chiral substrates observed (room temperature,\n1 h), see Scheme 65.352 THF gave\nslightly poorer yields of about −5% during solvent screening\nreaction development. Similarly, Schwartz’s reagent can be\nutilized to reduce isothiocyanates to thioformamides.351 Electron withdrawing groups attached to the\naromatic isocyanates were also well tolerated including reactive functional\ngroups such as azo and azide motifs.353 The use of 2-MeTHF and the use of an in situ generated\nSchwartz reagent as the hydride source were crucial for obtaining\nhigh chemocontrol.354 Schwartz’s reagent\nis prepared in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and LiAl(O-t-Bu)3H, that is, Snieckus protocol. Subtle differences in the solubilizing and stabilizing\neffect of\n2-MeTHF have been effectively leveraged by Lelo et al., who have successfully\nemployed this solvent to promote α-elimination of lithium halide\nsalts to carbenoids, that is, Kirmse’s α-elimination.\nTaking advantage of the unique properties of 2-MeTHF, LiX salts have\nbeen degraded to carbenoids and reacted in situ with\nepoxides to give β-halohydrins. Employing THF or diethyl ether\nunder the same conditions helps to stabilize the lithium salts, and\nthe transformations were poorly accommodated by these more stabilizing\nsolvents.355 Other uses of ICH2X include the NaBH4-mediated reduction of diselenides\nin the presence of ICH2F to give α-fluoromethyl selenoethers.356 Synthesis of secondary amides from phenyl\nthiocarbamates and commercially\navailable Grignard reagents has been demonstrated by Mampuys et al.\nutilizing 2-MeTHF as solvent, see Scheme 66.357 Good to\nexcellent yields were observed across a wide variety of substrates\nincluding sterically hindered and electron-deficient compounds (Scheme 67). The Grignard reaction manifold\nrepresents a classical and key methodology\nfor C–C bond formation. Grignard reactions, at their simplest,\ninvolve the addition of an organomagnesium halide to a carbonyl\ncontaining molecule, forming a new C–C bond and an alcohol.\nThe reaction was discovered in 1900 by Victor Grignard, for which\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912.358 The reaction today is still widely employed and has even\nbeen conducted in the large scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and their intermediates.177 Grignard reactions have classically employed solvents of concern\nsuch as THF or diethyl ether, thus prompting the research group of\nZhang et al. to undertake a systematic study evaluating the performance\nof a variety of alternative and more sustainable solvents in Grignard-type\nreactions.177 It was demonstrated that\n2-MeTHF performed just as well or out-performed diethyl ether or THF\nin a wide variety of Grignard reactions including benzyl, aryl, and\nheteroaromatic Grignard reagents. CPME was also shown to be an appropriate\nsolvent when DIBAL-H instead of I2 was used as an initiator.\nA solvent comparison study for the formation of API tramadol was also\nconducted, see Scheme 64, with 2-MeTHF outperforming THF by +11% yield. After a performance\nevaluation and screening of solvents for a range of Grignard reactions,\nZhang et al. now recommend the use of 2-MeTHF as alternative solvent\nto Et2O and THF for the preparation of most Grignard reagents\nand their subsequent reactions, see Scheme 68. They noted that the use of 2-MeTHF was\nequal if not superior in suppressing the Wurtz coupling byproduct\nfrom benzyl Grignard reactions, see Table 13.177 The use of Reformatsky reagents in the large-scale synthesis of\nvarious enantiopure N-tert-butanesulfinyl trifluoromethyl\nβ-amino esters from bench-stable analogues of aliphatic and\naromatic trifluoromethyl N-tert-butanesulfinyl ketoimines\nwas reported by Grellepois, see Scheme 69. During optimization studies, it was found\nthat 2-MeTHF was the best solvent.359 The synthesis of enantioenriched\nalcohols via the Corey-Baskshi-Shibata\n(CBS) oxazaborolidine-mediated reduction of prochiral ketones was\ncarried out by Luisi and co-workers using a combination of flow technology\nand 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 70. The optimized conditions gave the desired asymmetric products\nin yields of up to 99% and 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), with a reaction\nduration 10 min.360 CPME, as discussed preciously in section 2, has been available\nin commercially useful\nquantities since 2005165 and has been utilized\nin a wide variety of reaction classes including organometallic mediated\ntransformations. A selection of examples highlighting some of the\nbreadth and scope of CPME employment in organometallic reactions will\nbe discussed in this section. In 2007, Okabayashi et al. developed\na facile method for the regio- and stereoselective preparation of\nketene trimethylsilyl acetals (KSAs) from t-butyl\nesters or ketoesters using strong bases such as LDA and NaHMDS, in\nconjunction with TMSCl, and CPME as solvent. The reactions were conducted\nunder mild conditions, 0–5 °C, 2.5 h and produced both\n(E)-KSAs and 1,3-bis(TMS)-KSAs, see Scheme 71.361 α-Oxygen and α -nitrogen-substituted t-butyl esters were also shown to be compatible with this methodology.\nDuring solvent screening for reaction condition optimization, it was\nshown that other ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, THF, 1,4-dioxane,\nand dimethoxyethane led to poor regioselectivity and C-silylation, whereas CPME by comparison outperformed all of these\nsolvents. CPME has also seen use as a\ncosolvent in conjunction with THF,\nsee Scheme 72. Takeda\net al. demonstrated that CPME was critical for a titanocene-mediated\nketone allylation strategy that gave access to alkyl systems containing\nadjacent stereocenters in high yield and high diastereoselectivity.362 CPME has also been used as a co-solvent (in\nconjunction with toluene) by researchers at Novartis who employed\nthe solvent as a stabilizer for a Grignard reagent during a reaction\nsequence.363 The stabilizing effect of CPME was once again\nexploited by Molander\net al. during their reaction optimization for the synthesis of azaborines.\nA 1:1 mixture of CPME:toluene was discovered to be optimum.364 Azaborines represent an important and emerging\nclass of potential isosteric replacements for traditional carbon containing\nheterocycles, and the methodology developed, Scheme 73, has allowed for facile synthesis using,\nat least in part, a more contemporary solvent. The Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is a classical\nmethod for the\nsynthesis of cyclopropanes from alkenes via insertion of a zinc carbene,\nsee Scheme 74. THF\nor diethyl ether is most often employed as solvent in this reaction\nmanifold, and in 2013, Fujii et al. conducted solvent screening to\ndetermine whether other alternative ethers could be used. It was demonstrated\nthat reactions conducted using CPME went to completion up to ten-times\nfaster than those in diethyl ether with no loss in product yield or\nselectivity. Yield improvements in some cases were also noted.365 In 2015, Pace et al. demonstrated that CPME was the optimum\nsolvent\nfor their synthesis of thioamides from the corresponding isothiocyanate\nand lithium reagent, see Scheme 75. Solvent screening showed CPME to be superior to traditional\nethers such as THF and diethyl ether and even outperformed 2-MeTHF\nin terms of yield. The methodology reported provides robust and efficient\naccess to secondary thioamides from commercially available isothiocyanates\nand includes examples where chiral isothiocyanates or organolithium\nreagents have been used to form enantiopure products with excellent\nselectivity. In 2016, a thorough investigation into the use\nof CPME in Grignard\nreactions was conducted by Kobayashi et al., see Scheme 76.345 It was shown that CPME can be used in place of THF to great effect\nand that DIBALH was the most effective method of activating the Mg\nwhen using CPME as solvent. Efficient solvent recycling of CPME was\nalso demonstrated with no loss of yield observed. Promisingly, CPME\nwas shown to be stable to Grignard reagents during long-term storage\nwith no solvent degradation observed. Furthermore, Grignard reagent\nstability in CPME was often in the order of many months; thus, CPME\ncould be used in commercial preparations of Grignard reagents.345 Ureas are used\nin agrochemicals, and in the pharmaceutical industry where they are\nfound in areas such as antibiotics, antimalarial compounds, antimicrobials,\nand many others. They have also been utilized as catalysts, ligands,\nand solvents, see Scheme 77. A greener, mild, and efficient\napproach for the synthesis of ureas,\nfrom isocyanates and secondary amines, was developed by Camp and co-workers\nusing the bioalternative solvent Cyrene, see Scheme 78.88 This method\nremoves the use of toxic solvents such as DMF, which has been used\nin the traditional synthesis of ureas. A simple workup procedure for\nthe removal of Cyrene was also established by the addition of water,\nwhich led to precipitation of the desired urea. The substrate scope\nof both the amine and isocyanate was investigated. Steglich\nesterification remains a commonly employed technique for the mild\nsynthesis of esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols or thiols.184,367 This methodology employs coupling reagents often encountered in\namide bond formation such as carbodiimides and relies heavily on either\nDCM or DMF as solvents of choice.8,367 Solvent-reagent\nselection guides for both ester and thioester synthesis have been\ndeveloped by Jordan et al. and effectively demonstrate the effective\nreplacement of dipolar aprotic solvents with safer, more sustainable\nalternatives, see Scheme 79. For the formation of thioesters from acids and thiols,\nit was found\nthat coupling reagent T3P in conjunction with solvent cyclopentanone\ngave good to excellent yields across a variety of building-block-like\nmolecules, often with rapid reaction times of just 1 h, see Scheme 79 (left). 2-MeTHF,\nEtOAc, DMC, and CPME were also shown to be viable alternatives, though\nless general in their applicability/compatibility to the substrates\nscreened.184 A solvent-reagent guide\nfor ester formation from alcohols and acids\nhas also been recently developed. In this study, a high-throughput\napproach allowed for the simultaneous identification of alternative\nsolvent DMC in conjunction with safer coupling reagent 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium\niodide (Mukaiyama’s reagent). Further optimized conditions\nwere identified from the initial screen and then successfully applied\nin the synthesis of a selection of building-block-like molecules,\nsee Scheme 79 (right).\nIn both studies, less desirable polar aprotic solvents were successfully\nreplaced with greener, safer, more sustainable alternatives. Steglich esterification in water has also been demonstrated by\nFattahi et al. using DIC as coupling reagent, though the methodology\nis limited to phenolic alcohols due to their lower pKa when compared to aliphatic alcohols in water.265 A range of peptide-based compounds are widely\nused globally, including\nclinically used hormones such as oxytocin, and peptide therapeutics.\nFrom 2015–2019, 208 new drugs were approved by the FDA, 15\nof which were peptides or peptide-containing molecules (7%).370 The increasing proportion of therapeutics falling\ninto the peptides category has been accompanied by a need for more\nsustainable methods for the solid phase synthesis of peptides (SPPS),\nsee Scheme 80. Commonly\nused solvents for SPPS fall within the reprotoxic dipolar aprotics\ncategory, being DMF, DMAc, and NMP.371 The\nchallenges in improving the sustainability in peptide synthesis and\npurification are well reviewed by Isidro-Llobet et al.372 Recently, a number of publications have aimed\nto move away from\nreprotoxic dipolar aprotic solvents in solid phase peptide synthesis,\nswitching to more sustainable alternatives. The work of Lawrenson\net al. has successfully demonstrated the use of propylene carbonate\nas a safer, more sustainable alternative to polar aprotic solvents\nsuch as DMF or NMP. In their publication, both SPPS and solution phase\nmethodology were successfully demonstrated using propylene carbonate\nas solvent with no significant impact on racemization of the amino\nacid (AA) observed. Synthesis of nonapeptide “Bradykinin”\nwas also demonstrated. NBP was identified by Novartis in 2018\nduring a systematic examination\nof 34 alternative solvents shortlisted as potential DMF replacements\nin SPPS.222 A number of parameters were\nexamined including solvent ability to swell resin, solubility of SPPS\nreagents, and reaction performance including Fmoc deprotection steps.\nNBP was successfully demonstrated as a viable drop-in replacement\nfor DMF; NBP was successfully used as the solvent during the SPPS\nsynthesis of an octapeptide with comparable yield and purity to that\nof DMF (93% yield NBP vs >99% DMF, 80% purity NBP vs 86% DMF).\nOne\nmajor point of difference was highlighted: NBP is more viscous than\nDMF (4.0 cP vs 0.8 cP) and makes for slower fluid transfer steps during\nsmaller scale SPPS operations.222 Two reports were published in 2020 in which the solvent NBP was\nused in place of traditional solvents. Kumar et al. have successfully\ndemonstrated the use of NBP as a replacement for DMF and NMP SPPS\noperations using both in situ activation and preactivation\nstrategies. Less racemization was observed for reactions conducted\nin NBP, and a reduction in the generation of side-products when forcing\nconditions were utilized was also observed. Thus, NBP has been demonstrated\nas a superior alternative to both DMF and NMP in this study.373 De la Torre et al. report the successful\nuse of NBP in an SPPS\nsequence employing problematic amino acid residue Fmoc-Arg (Pbf)–OH;\npbf = (2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl group).\nThe amino acid residue is particularly troublesome due to its propensity\nto react intramolecularly leading to δ-lactam side product.\nA systematic analysis of reaction conditions allowed for the identification\nof optimum conditions, and NBP was shown to be an excellent alternative\nsolvent to DMF, with levels of amino acid incorporation into the peptide\nbackbone approaching 100%. Purity of the crude peptides was also similar.374 From a safety perspective, it has been\nreported by Erny et al.\nthat the levels of HCN produced in DIC/Oxyma mediate amide bond forming\nreactions can be significantly reduced when a mixture of NBP:EtOAc\n1:4 is employed.375 In conjunction with\ndimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) as a HCN scrubbing additive, the authors\nsuggest that with further developments, the implementation of this\nmethodology combining greener solvents and HCN-free synthesis could\nbe applied to the industrial manufacturing of peptides. Other\nthan NBP, GVL has also been proposed as a potential alternative\nsolvent in SPPS. The group of Albericio and co-workers illustrated\nthat GVL could be utilized in polystyrene (PS)-based SPPS. GVL showed\nexcellent coupling efficiencies in both the synthesis of a pentapeptide\n(Aib-enkephalin) and decapeptide (Aib-ACP), with no major side products\nor ring opening products detected.376 A\nfollow-up to this work was published in 2019 demonstrating the effectiveness\nof GVL in Wang resin SPPS; DCM was effectively replaced as an alternative\nsolvent for the initial anchoring to the Wang resin. Subsequent elongation\nof the peptide was also successfully conducted in GVL with racemization\nand dipeptide formation found to be within acceptable levels.377 Both publications also note the compatibility\nof Fmoc residues in GVL. Most recently, Leko et al. have demonstrated\nthat a combination of EtOAc/CH3CN can be used in chlorotrityl\nchloride and 4-methylbenzhydryl bromide resin loading operations\nwith loading levels comparable to that when DCM, THF, 2-MeTHF, or\nDMF was utilized.378 In recent years,\nthere has been a significant expansion in the field of biocatalysis,\ncommonly using water as a solvent or cosolvent. However, there are\na number of problems associated with the use of water as a solvent\nin biocatalysis, even though it is readily available, is nonhazardous,\nand does not have the flammability or explosion risks associated with\norganic solvents.379 Many synthetically\nuseful reagents, those that are of interest in biocatalytic transformations,\nare poorly water-soluble, which in turn results in a requirement of\nextremely dilute reaction mixtures, leading to increased solvent use.\nThere has been a recent drive for discovery of enzymatic reactions\ncompatible with sustainable organic solvents, most notably 2-MeTHF380 and CPME.168 The most expansive class of enzymatic reaction using 2-MeTHF is that\nof hydrolases, mostly in stereoselective acylations for kinetic resolutions\nof racemates.381−383 In 2017, Secundo and co-workers reported\nthe use of 2-MeTHF in the esterification of a range of natural products\n(menthol, rac-sulcatol and rac-α-cyclogeraniol)\nusing a range of commercial lipases.384 2-MeTHF, as well as CPME, performed well compared to traditional\nsolvents such as toluene and MTBE, with high enantioselectivity. A\nsimilar enzymatic acylation of racemic benzoin in 2-MeTHF, reported\nby Alcántara and colleagues in 2011, using Pseudomonas\nstutzeri lipase (PSL) and Shvo’s catalyst, led to\nkinetic resolution over 48 h, in a 85% yield and 99% e.e. (Scheme 81).385 Numerous additional examples are also found\nwithin the literature using 2-MeTHF as an alternative bio-based solvent,\ntargeting selective acylations of glycosides.386−390 Away from kinetic resolutions, Pseudomonas stutzeri lipase (PSL) has additionally be used as an effective catalyst in\namination reactions of esters, reported by Wong et al. in 2011.391 Shown to form a wide range of alkyl and aryl\namides, 2-MeTHF was reportedly selected due to a high solubilizing\nability of the organic starting materials, with MTBE also shown to\nperform effectively in the transformation. A selection of papers\nusing 2-MeTHF as a bio-based solvent, for\naccessing chiral α-hydroxyketones through either carboligation392,393 or domino enzymatic reactions,394 have\nalso been reported. The first of which, by Domínquez de María\nin 2010, involved use of 2-MeTHF as a (co)solvent alternative to DMSO\nor MTBE for enantioselective C–C bond formation between aldehydes.\nCatalyzed by a thiamine diphosphate-dependent lyase (ThDP-Lyase),\nan efficient enantioselective carboligation of aldehydes to furnish\nchiral α-hydroxyketones was described, providing products in\n>90% yield and generally >95% e.e. (Scheme 82a). A similar report by Rother and co-workers\nin 2012 also used ThDP-Lyase for the umpolung carboligation\nof acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde, examining the relative product distribution\nof the eight possible enantiomeric products.393 (a) Carboligation of aldehydes\nto produce chiral α-hydroxyketones. (b) Domino enzymatic process\nfor the preparation of 2-HPP, with in situ generation\nof acetaldehyde via kinetic resolution. This\nwas further followed up in 2012 by a domino enzymatic cascade\nusing an aldehyde and butyrate or laurate substrate, in the presence\nof Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) and benzaldehyde\nlyase (BAL).394 An initial conversion of\nthe vinyl ester into acetaldehyde, followed by a subsequent C–C\nbond formation with benzaldehyde, catalyzed by BAL, furnished (R)-2-hydroxypropriophenone (2-HPP) in quantitative\nconversion and >99% e.e. (Scheme 82b). Although the majority of biocatalytic transformations\ncarried out\nin organic solvents such as 2-MeTHF fall under the hydrolases class\ndue to their high robustness, a small number of other enzymes are\nalso compatible. In 2014, metagenome screening by Kurokawa and colleagues\nidentified a dehydrogenase enzyme, homologous Leifsoniaadh alcohol\ndehydrogenase (HLADH), which was able to effectively reduce a selection\nof ketones, with high tolerance to 2-MeTHF, in excellent (generally\n>99%) enantiomeric excess.395 Similar\nketone\nreductions have been reported, for example, using YOL151W reductase396 and KREDs (Scheme 83).397 Other than 2-MeTHF, a solvent\n(or cosolvent) that has demonstrated\npotential within biocatalytic transformations is cyclopentyl methyl\nether (CPME). CPME, similar to 2-MeTHF, has proven effective in kinetic\nresolution, such as the one reported by González-Sabín\nand co-workers in 2017.398 As part of a\nkey step in the synthesis of Ivabradine, a drug used for the treatment\nof stable angina pectoris, alkoxycarbonylation kinetic resolution\nof an amine precursor was carried out using the lipase PSC-II and\ndiethylcarbonate, yielding the desired (S)-enantiomer\nin 30% yield, 92% e.e. (Scheme 84). The utility of CPME as a solvent in the reduction of imine-type\nfunctionalities, using IREDs (imine reductases), was reported by Rother\nand Maugeri in 2016.399 Reduction of cyclic\nC=N functionalities using whole cells containing Streptomyces\naurantiacus and Paenibacillus elgii B69\ngave an e.r. of >99:1 under micro aqueous reaction conditions (Scheme 85).\n\n## Suzuki-Miyaura\nCross-Coupling\nPalladium\ncatalysis is used extensively in both industrial and academic synthetic\nchemistry laboratories as a powerful methodology for the formation\nof C–C bonds. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of organoboronic\nacids and their derivatives is the most frequently utilized palladium-catalyzed\nC–C bond forming reactions in the chemical industry, see Scheme 15.14 Traditionally, ethereal solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and\nTHF or dipolar aprotics such as DMF are employed for a large proportion\nof these reactions.14 Owing to the frequent\nuse and importance of this reaction, there is great potential for\n“greener” solvent alternatives to have a significant\nimpact. Note that discussion surrounding the use of Suzuki-Miyaura\nreactions as a benchmark for the performance of new solvents suggests\nthat it is not the most informative reaction manifold.270 For example, cross-coupling can be successfully\nconducted in rapeseed oil and butter with both of these lipid-based\nsystems outperforming benchmark solvent DMF.271 Watson and co-workers developed a mild method\nfor the Suzuki-Miyaura\nreaction that employed Cyrene as a greener alternative to the commonly\nused dipolar aprotic solvents (Scheme 16).14 The reaction\nscope was extensively explored by varying both the organoboron nucleophile\nand aryl electrophile. The conditions developed demonstrated excellent\ngenerality and functional group tolerance. The group reported 57 examples\nwith yields ranging from 44 to 100%, from discovery to gram-scale\nreactions. Hunt et al. have explored the use of NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent\nfor Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 17.110 Yields for\na series of reactions performed in both NMP and NBP have been reported,\nto carry out a comparison, using a range of different substituted\naryl halides to explore the scope. Although the results showed that\nreactions using NMP as solvent gave better yields overall (76–90%\nfor model reactions utilizing 4-iodoacetophenone and a range\nof phenylboronic acids), reactions carried out in NBP still gave good\nyields (∼10% lower for the same model reaction), as seen in Table 5. However, the reactions\nhad not been optimized to specifically favor N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone,\nso there may also be potential to improve the performance of these\nreactions. Dimethyl isosorbide has been\ndemonstrated as an effective reaction\nmedium for several classical cross-coupling reactions. In 2018, Watson\net al. reported the use of DMI in several Suzuki-Miyaura reactions\n(12 substrates). In general, aromatics with various electron donating\nand withdrawing groups were tolerated as were variations in the electrophilic\ncomponent including vinyl groups, boronic acids, and pinacol esters.214 Reaction times were 1 h conducted at 60 °C\nwith 4 mol % Pd(dppf)Cl2, and yields ranged from 62 to\n>99%. Garg and co-workers have reported the nickel-catalyzed\nSuzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling between aryl halides and (hetero)aromatic boronic\nacids in a number of greener solvent alternatives.272 Initial solvent screening showed that EtOAc, iPrOH, 2-MeTHF,\nand t-amyl alcohol were all demonstrated to be excellent\nalternatives, see Scheme 18, to traditionally employed solvents such as toluene or 1,4-dioxane.\nThe reaction scope was further explored using 2-MeTHF and t-amyl alcohol as solvents. The scope was found to be broad\npertaining to both coupling partners, with heterocycles well tolerated\n(Scheme 18). The methodology\nwas demonstrated on multigram scales using low catalyst loadings (0.5–1.0\nmol % nickel) to provide desired products in reasonable to excellent\nyields. 2-MeTHF has also been successfully employed as reaction solvent\nin palladium–NHC-catalyzed amide and ester cleaving cross-coupling\nreactions.273 Following the emergence of eucalyptol as a sustainable,\nbioderived\nsolvent, the utility of it in cross-coupling reactions has been explored\nin a number of transformations by Berteina-Raboin and colleagues.205−207 When tested in palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling\nreactions of arylboronic acids with heteroaryl chlorides, eucalyptol\noutperformed reactions conducted in THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, with\nyields ranging from 44 to 99%. Reaction temperatures of 100 °C\nwere required for complete dissolution of reagents.\n\n## Mizoroki-Heck Cross-Coupling\nThe\nMizoroki-Heck cross-coupling, commonly referred to as the Heck cross-coupling,\ninvolves the reaction of an aryl halide with an alkene under Pd(0)/Pd(II)\ncatalysis. Common reaction solvents for the Heck reaction include\n1,4-dioxane, THF, and amide-based solvents such as DMF and DMAc, see Scheme 19. Although there\nare examples using more sustainable solvents such as water and acetonitrile,\nexpansion of the available green solvents for the transformation is\nunderway.110,214 Hunt et al. have explored the scope and limitations of the use\nof NBP as a dipolar aprotic solvent for the Heck cross-coupling reaction,\nsee Scheme 20, in\naddition to Suzuki-Miyaura couplings.110 The group reported and compared the yields from a series of reactions\nperformed in both NMP and NBP. In summary, they found that the Heck\nreactions carried out in NBP gave comparable to or higher yields than\nthose carried out in NMP, see Table 6. This comparison has demonstrated that NBP was a viable\nreplacement to NMP as reaction solvent in the Heck cross-coupling\nreactions examined. Dimethyl isosorbide has also been\ndemonstrated as an effective\nreaction medium for the Mizoroki-Heck reaction by Watson et al.214 Optimized reaction conditions using 5 mol %\nPd(dppf)Cl2 were trialled on 12 substrates and showed that\nthe reaction proceeded well with aryl iodides and bromides facilitating\ncoupling of both electron poor and rich arenes with a variety of vinyl\nketones and acrylamides in 47–91% yield. Reactions were generally\nconducted at 80 °C for 1 h though some aryl bromide examples\nrequired heating at 115 °C for 24 h.214 Another alternative class of solvents shown to have utility\nin\nMizoroki-Heck cross-couplings reactions is that of cyclic carbonates,\nsee Figure 29. In\na study evaluating the use of a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents\nfor the transformation, Clark and colleagues demonstrated the effective\nuse of propylene and ethylene carbonate in the place of NMP and DMSO.107 In many cases, both cyclic carbonate solvents\nperformed as or more effectively than NMP across a wide substrate\nscope, tolerating substrates of various electronics.

Recently, Su et al.\nhave demonstrated that DMI could be effectively\nutilized in a Ni-catalyzed reductive cross-coupling of aryl bromides\nwith vinyl acetate (acting as a vinylating reagent).274 Moderate to excellent yields of the vinylated products\nwere observed across a wide and varied heteroaryl substrate scope,\nsee Scheme 21.\n\n## Sonogashira Coupling\nThe Sonogashira\ncross-coupling is a widely used palladium and copper-catalyzed process\nfor accessing functionalized alkyne species from terminal alkynes\nand aryl halides, see Scheme 22.275 Another powerful C–C\nbond forming reaction, the Sonogashira reaction is commonly performed\nin THF and DMF,276 both of which are problematic\ndue to peroxide formation and reprotoxicity, respectively. Because\nof the efficiency and widespread use of this reaction in both academia\nand industry, a search for greener solvent alternatives is highly\ndesirable. Cyrene has been successfully\nutilized by Watson et al. as reaction\nsolvent for Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions, see Scheme 23.127 Utilization of the safer, more sustainable Cyrene as an alternative\nto traditionally employed DMF127 was demonstrated\nacross a number of aryl and heteroaryl iodides and alkyne coupling\npartners. Broad tolerance to the optimized reaction conditions was\nobserved with yields of 65–99% generally reported, though yield\nvariability was observed for some electron deficient aryl bromides\n(28–99%). Further expansion of the methodology to Cacchi-type\nannulations furnished benzofuran and indole scaffolds in good to excellent\nyields (73–100%), see Scheme 24. Dimethyl isosorbide has been successfully utilized as\nreaction\nsolvent for the Sonogashira reaction by Watson et al. Twelve substrates\nwere synthesized using the same catalyst and base conditions as depicted\nin Scheme 23 (reactions\nwere conducted at 25 °C).214 A range\nof aryl iodides and bromides including electron rich and deficient\nexamples, and a number of functionalized alkynes including BMIDA and\nTIPS functionalities, were synthesized in 83–98% yields. One\nexample of a thiophenol derived alkyne was synthesized, though in\na lower yield of 65%.214 Cabri and\nco-workers have recently published an investigation into\nthe use of N-substituted-pyrrolidinone solvents,\nalong with a small number of others, as a reaction medium for the\nSonogashira coupling.276 Given the knowledge\nof the reprotoxicity problems associated with NMP,17 the safer and more sustainable species discussed, such\nas NBP (N-butyl-2-pyrrolidinone) and NCP (N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidinone), were shown to outperform\nDMF and NMP following optimization of reaction conditions. In addition\nto the broad substrate scope (generally >90% isolated yields),\nthe\nmethodology was applied to the synthesis of Erlotinib, performing\na Sonogashira cross-coupling step in quantitative yield, without the\nneed for a CuI additive, see Figure 30.276 Yield comparison for\nmodel Sonogashira reaction conducted by Cabri\net al. using a variety of NMP/DMF drop-in replacements.276 In addition to the previously\nmentioned explorations of the utility\nof eucalyptol as a solvent in palladium-catalyzed processes, it was\nalso shown to be effective in Sonogashira cross-couplings.277 A slightly different system to regular Sonogashira\ncross-couplings, utilizing Pd(PhCN)2Cl2 and\nPCy3, without addition of CuI, furnished a range of cross-coupled\nproducts in moderate to good yields.277 It was noted that the cross-coupling of any heterocycles containing\nfree amine functionality, such as 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine is ineffective when using eucalyptol\nas the solvent; further investigations are required to optimize this\nprocess such that yields are comparable to those obtained using traditional\nSonogashira solvents such as DMF.\n\n## Buchwald-Hartwig\nAmination\nBuchwald-Hartwig\namination is a widely employed cross-coupling strategy used for the\nformation of C–N bonds, see Scheme 25. Commonly used for substrates that are\nless reactive to nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the palladium-catalyzed\ntransformation is also known to perform well with oxygen and sulfur\nnucleophiles.278,279 1,4-Dioxane is commonly utilized\nas reaction solvent for these transformations, and 1,4-dioxane has\nserious issues and is regarded as a solvent of concern.280 A number of strategies\nto overcome this issue include reactions\nconducted solvent-free,281 in water,282 or using water–surfactant systems.55 In 2014, the Lipshutz group published methodology\ndescribing Buchwald-Hartwig amination using the TPGS-750-M surfactant–water\nsystem, see Scheme 26. In 2020, Manikandan and co-workers\nopted for the use of 2-MeTHF\nin the synthesis of a triazolo-pyridazine-6-yl-substituted via a Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-coupling.283 The 2-MeTHF was used\nas the solvent in the final stage of the synthesis for 12 medicinally\nrelevant antidiabetic compounds, and yields were reported in the range\nof 92–98% using a catalytic combination of 10 mol % Pd2(dba)3/XPhos, in the presence of NaOtBu at room temperature for 4 h, see Scheme 27. The use of a surfactant however is not always necessary, and aqueous\nsingle or two-phase systems have been known in the Pd-catalyzed amination\nmanifold.284 Further exploration into aqueous\nsystems has also been conducted and was well documented by Buchwald\net al. in 2003.285 Water has also\nbeen successfully utilized as reaction solvent in\nrelated Cu-catalyzed Ullman-type reactions,286 as have other safer solvents such as tBuOH.287 Solvent-free examples are also known.288 Bio-based solvent eucalyptol has also been studied\nfor its potential\nuse as solvent in the Buchwald-Hartwig amination, see Scheme 28. A number of model reactions\nwere examined encompassing a variety of bromoarenes and amines and\nanilines. Moderate to excellent yields were obtained (43–99%),\nin many cases better than the reported yields for the analogous reaction\nconducted in a conventional dipolar aprotic solvent.289 Ma et al. have demonstrated\nthat tBuOH could be\neffectively used as an alternative to 1,4-dioxane in the cross-coupling\nof amino acid esters with aryl bromides and chlorides, see Scheme 29.290 The methodology was not just limited to α-amino acids\nbut also included β-, γ-, and δ-, proteinogenic,\nand nonproteinogenic amino acids. Products were prepared generally\nin moderate to high yields with retention of optical activity. Other\nexamples utilizing tBuOH in Pd catalyzed C–N\nhave also been reported,291 and alcohols,\nsuch as iPrOH, have also seen use in Pd-catalyzed\nC–N and C–O bond forming reactions.292 Solvent-free, ball milling conditions have been described\nby Shao et al. in 2018.293 A solvent selection guide for conducting acyl Buchwald-Hartwig\ntransamidation reactions has recently been compiled by Lei et al.\nIn their study, an exhaustive solvent screen of alternative solvents\nhas been conducted including 2-MeTHF, CPME, GVL, anisole, and p-cymene, see Scheme 30.294 1,2-Dimethoxyethane\nwas used as a benchmark solvent, giving 86% yield in the same transformation.\nBoth 2-MeTHF and MTBE showed excellent generality and applicability\nacross a wide range of transamidation coupling partners demonstrated\nthrough a substrate screen consisting of a variety of anilines and\namides bearing EDGs and EWGs. Thus, dipolar aprotics of concern in\nthese reactions such as THF or 1,2-dimethoxyethane can be effectively\nreplaced by a drop-in alternative.294\n\n## Borylation Chemistry\nBecause of\nthe widespread use of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, and variants thereof,\nin synthetic and medicinal chemistry,14 and the requirement for a boronic acid or boronate coupling partner,\nsustainable methods for accessing these moieties are highly desirable.\nTraditional methods for preparation of boronic acids and boronates,\nsuch as the Miyaura borylation (Scheme 31), require dipolar aprotic solvents such\nas DMSO, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane.295 Recently, advancements have been made toward more sustainable\nsolvents\nfor borylation reactions, with cyclic ethers and cyclic ketones being\nused as substitutes. A recent publication by Frantz and co-workers\ndescribes a sustainable method for accessing arylboronic acids from\npseudohalides and B2(OH)4 using a 0.01 mol %\npalladium catalyst loading in a 1:1 mixture of 2-MeTHF and MeOH, see Scheme 32.296 Also described is a direct one-pot conversion of aryl halide\nto the boronic acid diethanolamine (DEA) adduct, providing synthesis\nof boronate species less susceptible to protodeboronation.297 This transformation is well-tolerated for aryl\nand (hetero)aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides, with yields ranging\nfrom 60–85%, on the choice of catalyst, (AtaPhos)2PdCl2 or XPhos-Pd-G3. The effectiveness of the methodology\nis demonstrated by a one-pot tandem borylation-Suzuki sequence, furnishing\na diverse range of C–C coupled products with no more than 2\nmol % palladium used for the overall two-step process. Many more examples\nof greener palladium-catalyzed borylations of aryl halides using B2(OH)4 or B2pin2 are known\nin 2-MeTHF298 and CPME.299 Although not as widely used as aryl and hetero(aryl)boronic\nacids and boronates, alkenyl boronates have important applications\nin Diels–Alder cycloadditions, as precursors to cyclopropyl\nboronates, and as effective radical acceptors.300 Recently, a number of publications have highlighted the\nuse of sustainable solvents in borylation reactions of alkynes, both\nrhodium301 and copper-catalyzed.302 A publication by Hutzler and co-workers in\n2017, outlining routes to the synthesis of herbicides, included a\nrhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with HBpin, with a solvent\nchoice of cyclohexanone.301 The reaction,\ncarried out below room temperature (18 °C), yielded the desired Z-alkene in 52% yield after 2 h (Scheme 33). Similarly, a publication by Woźniak and co-workers in 2019,\nshowcasing the utility of copper-NHC complexes containing sulfone\nand sulfoxide side-chains, describes a low catalyst loading (0.05\nmol %) hydroboration of alkynes, using CPME as the solvent, with a\nMeOH additive (10:1), see Scheme 34.302 In this instance, CPME\noutperforms both isopropanol and toluene, and the catalytic system\napplies to both alkynes (yielding alkenyl boronates) and alkenes (yielding\nalkyl boronates). Yields for all substrates studied are in excess\nof 95%, proving the methodology a very powerful and sustainable way\nto hydroborate alkynes and alkenes. In addition to solvent swaps to\nCPME, 2-MeTHF, and cyclohexanone, MTBE has also been shown to be highly\neffective in borylation sequences. Reported in 2009, Marder and co-workers\nutilized the solvent in a one-pot C–H borylation/Suzuki-Miyaura\ncross-coupling sequence, a transformation shown to be highly effective\nfor both aryl and heteroaryl substrates.174 Borylation in protic solvents such as MeOH303 and EtOH304 has also been reported including\nin the 2020 report on transition metal-free borylation of aryl halides\nusing bis-boronic acid in MeOH.305\n\n## C–H Activation\nThe direct\nactivation and functionalization of C–H bonds, which avoids\nthe installation of intermediate functional groups, is both step-\nand atom-efficient, see Scheme 35. However, the sustainability of C–H activation\nis hindered (especially for large-scale chemistry) by numerous factors,\none of these being the introduction of safer, greener, and more sustainable\nsolvents. In many examples of chemistry involving C–H activation,\ngreen solvents have been too easily overlooked in preference to solvents\nsuch as THF, DMF, and 1,4-dioxane, which have been frequently used.306 The inclusion of safer solvents such as 2-MeTHF\n(and exploring less conventional PEG or aqueous-micellar systems)\nduring reaction optimization and solvent screening is therefore critical\nif the field of C–H activation is to migrate away from solvents\nof concern. Reviews on the subject of emerging unconventional organic\nsolvents for C–H bond activation have been published in 2019\nby Gandeepan et al.,307 in 2020 by Yu et\nal.,308 and in 2021 by Dhawa et al.309 and Dalton et al.306 We direct the reader toward these bodies of work for further information\nand specific examples. The 2-MeTHF was used as a replacement to THF and 1,4-dioxane by\nAckerman and co-workers in a mild C–H activation of allenes\nusing a Fe(0) phosphine catalyst (Scheme 36).310 Across\na selection of aryl substrates containing an α-ketone directing\ngroup, efficient C–H functionalization using Fe(PMe3)4 yielded a diverse range of products in good to excellent\nyields. Also demonstrated was a tolerability of hydroxyl, amino, and\nalkoxycarbonyl moieties, in addition to mechanistic and computational\ninvestigations. The bioderived solvent eucalyptol has also been shown to have utility\nas a solvent for direct C–H arylations by Berteina-Raboin and\ncolleagues.277 Following synthesis of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines from the corresponding 2-aminopyridine\nand 2-bromoacetophenone derivatives, Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed\ndirect C–H arylation at the C-3 position using bromobenzene\nin eucalyptol yielded the desired arylated product in 60% (5 mol %\ncat.) and 61% yields (10 mol % cat.) after 24 h at 150 °C, see Scheme 37. Other bio-based\nsolvents such as cumene have also been promoted as a potential solvent\nfor C–H bond activation chemistry.308 A regioselective C–H functionalization of 1,2,3-triazoles\nin GVL was accomplished by Vaccaro and co-workers in continuous flow,\nsee Scheme 38. Across\n8 substrates, excellent yields (79–91%) of the cyclized product\nwere obtained, with solvent recovery and reuse, without further purification,\nalso demonstrated.311 Kakiuchi and co-workers developed a Ru-catalyzed stereoselective\nC–H arylation of ortho-methoxylated acetophenones and C–H\nmonoarylation of ortho-unsubstituted acetophenones in high yields\nusing cyclohexanone as solvent, see Scheme 39. Note: styrene was utilized as a necessary\nadditive to selectively provide monoarylation.312,313 Aqueous surfactant systems such as TPGS750M-H2O have\nalso been successfully utilized in ruthenium-catalyzed C–H\narylation reactions.314 PEG-based systems have been demonstrated as promising alternatives\nto conventional solvents as evidenced by Ackermann et al., who first\nshowed in 2009 that PEG-20000 could be used as solvent for either\nRu- or Pd-catalyzed direct arylation chemistry.315 This discovery has led to other PEG-derived systems such\nas that demonstrated by Reddy et al.316 who showed that PEG-400 was an excellent solvent for Cu-mediated\ncross-coupling of oxadiazoles with dibromoalkenes, see Scheme 40. When conventional\nsolvents such as CH3CN and DCM were screened instead of\nthe PEG, no reaction took place.\n\n## Boc\nDeprotection\nThe t-butyl carbamate (Boc)\ngroup is a common protecting group for amines,\nmost often utilized in multistep syntheses due to its stability under\na wide range of reaction conditions. One of the most common methods\nof deprotection typically employs 4 M HCl in 1,4-dioxane, a solvent\nit would be good to replace when possible, see Scheme 41. Commercially available alternatives to 1,4-dioxane\npreparations\nof HCl are available in safer, more sustainable solvents including\nethereal alternative CPME.317 Given the\nincreasing availability of HCl solutions in more sustainable solvents,\nit is recommended that alternative mixtures are considered before\nopting to use HCl in 1,4-dioxane. Several examples throughout the\nliterature demonstrate the utility of more sustainable methods for\nBoc deprotections, as part of lengthy syntheses. As part of\nthe design and testing of a sustainable methodology\nfor an improved Pinner reaction in CPME, Torisawa and co-workers discuss\nthe use of a 4 M solution of HCl in CPME for the deprotection of a\nBoc-protected amino acid derivative.318 Stirring of the derivative for 6 h at 0 °C provided the desired\ndeprotected amine in 97% yield, with the workup procedure also employing\nthe greener solvent. A common alternative acidic medium for the deprotection\nof Boc groups involves the use of CF3CO2H, trifluoroacetic\nacid (TFA). The use of TFA within a sustainable solvent was demonstrated\nas part of a peptide coupling by North et al. in 2017, in which the\nfinal Boc deprotection step used a solution of TFA in propylene carbonate,\nsee Scheme 42.319 Use of this combination provided sequential\ndeprotection yields between 80 and 99% yields in the three individual\nBoc deprotection steps in the multistep synthesis of tetrapeptides. An additional example demonstrating the deprotection of a Boc group\nwas reported in a Pfizer patent in 2005.320 Instead of using TFA or HCl, a biphasic mixture of sodium tert-butoxide in H2O/2-MeTHF provided improved\nconditions for the deprotection of a range of heterocyclic substrates\nwith medicinal applications, see Scheme 43.158\n\n## Carbonylations\nand Carboxylations\nAldehydes, amides, esters, and carboxylic\nacids are abundant groups\nin synthetic organic chemistry, whether as part of a reaction intermediate\nor pharmaceutically relevant scaffold. Traditional methods for the\npreparation of such species include hydroformylations of alkenes and\namide couplings, to name a few, which often require toxic heavy metals,321 pyrophoric organometallic reagents,322 or allergenic amide coupling reagents.323 In recent years there has been a shift toward\ncatalytic methodologies including palladium-catalyzed formylations\nand carbonylations of aryl halides using carbon monoxide gas or surrogates\nthereof.324 Unfortunately, use of the gas\nis often accompanied by the use of dipolar aprotic solvents such as\nDMF,325 see Schemes 44 and 45, or 1,4-dioxane,326 see Scheme 46, to aid the solubility of the gas in the reaction\nmedium.327 Recently, there has been interest in substituting reprotoxic dipolar\naprotic solvents with more sustainable alternatives for carbonylation\nreactions. One of the alternative solvents for such transformations\nhas been the cellulose-derived solvent GVL. In 2016, initial exploratory\nwork into the use of biomass-derived solvents by Mika and colleagues\nrevealed the utility of GVL in the aminocarbonylation of aryl\nhalides under CO(g), see Scheme 47.328 In a system catalyzed\nby Pd(OAc)2/PPh3, it was shown that a mixture\nof the carboxamide and ketocarboxamide products could be obtained,\nand relative ratio of the ketocarboxamide could be favored by\nincreasing of CO(g) pressure, see Table 7.328 Following\non from this initial work, the group later published\na palladium-catalyzed carbonylative esterification of aryl iodides\nwith a wide range of alcohols in 2020.329 Again using GVL, the transformation provided a wide range of ester\nproducts with significantly improved yields compared to the previous\naminocarbonylation,328 ranging from\n39 to 99% with phenol coupling partners and 13–99% with alkyl\nalcohol coupling partners, see Scheme 48.329 In 2019, Schwab and co-workers\nreported a simple and efficient\naminocarbonylation process to access 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides\nfrom the related heteroaryl iodide species.330 The Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed process involved in situ generation of CO(g) using a combination of H2SO4 and HCO2H within CO-ware equipment.\nUtilizing the sustainable solvent dimethyl carbonate, a variety of\nfunctionalized 1,2,3-triazole-5-carboxamides were produced, with yields\nranging from 33 to 98% (Scheme 49).330 In the area of carboxylation reactions, in 2015, Levacher\nand co-workers\nreported a sustainable carboxylation of organic (heteroaryl, alkenyl,\nand allyl) halides in 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 50.331 Using N-hydroxysuccinimidyl formate as a CO2(g)\nsurrogate, and in the process eliminating the requirement for a high\nCO2-solubilizing dipolar aprotic solvent and opting for\nthe use of 2-MeTHF, a wide range of N-hydroxysuccinimide\nesters were accessible (Scheme 50). The methodology was shown to be effective in the\ncarboxylation of a functionalized quinoline intermediate in the preparation\nof a number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, with\nthe transformation progressing in 82% isolated yield.331 Metal-catalyzed hydroamination of styrenes has recently been reported\nby Mulks et al., see Scheme 51. In their work, the conventional wisdom of air- and moisture-free\norganometallic reactions is challenged by their demonstration of hydroamination\nof aryl alkenes in 2-MeTHF using lithium amides, see Table 8. Reactions were open to air\nand moisture and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Yields were\nmoderate to excellent with some incompatibility observed when using\nstyrenes containing aryl halide moieties.332 Remarkably, the presence of adventitious moisture was shown to be\nbeneficial and not detrimental. Reactions were accelerated by moisture,\nwhich generated free amine in situ at a steady rate.332 Sodium amides were also shown to be compatible\nwith the methodology. In 2020, a publication by Gevorgyan et al.\ninvestigated the utility\nof newly discovered biomass-sourced solvents in carboxylation reactions.208 In an overall transformation for the hydrocarboxylation\nof alkenes, via a boronate species from an initial hydroboration with\n9-BBN, sustainable solvents including eucalyptol, dimethyl isosorbide\n(DMI), and GVL were screened, see Scheme 52. Given that the process occurs via a boronate\nspecies, the effectiveness of the secondary carboxylation of boronic\nacid pinacol esters, Bpins, was also explored. For the overall hydrocarboxylation\nof 4-methylstyrene, 2-MeTHF, eucalyptol, DMI, and GVL were all found\nto outperform dipolar aprotics of concern including THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nsee Table 9. The hydroboration\nmethodology was not restricted to just benzylic alkenes, that is,\nstyrenes.208 For the conversion of phenyl Bpin to the corresponding phenyl carboxylic\nacid, of the general type depicted in Scheme 53, DMI was found to outperform THF and 1,4-dioxane,\nwith 2-MeTHF and (+)-rose oxide also notably performing above 70%\nyield (Table 10).\nIn addition to these two reactions, the solvents were comparatively\nscreened for numerous other carboxylation processes including transition\nmetal-catalyzed carboxylations (copper, zirconium, iron, and nickel).208 The Cu-catalyzed carboyxylation methodology\nwas further applied toward the synthesis of active pharmaceutical\ningredients Fenoprofen (60% yield) and Flurbiprofen (53% yield). Pd-catalyzed alkoxy- and amino-carbonylation and aryl bromide/boronic\nacid carbonylation in greener more sustainable solvents has been recently\ndemonstrated by Ismael et al.333 Sixteen\npotentially safer, more sustainable solvents were included during\nsolvent screening investigations including dipolar aprotic alternatives\nsuch as DMI, GVL, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, and\nether 2-MeTHF. It was found that aminocarbonylation proceeded\nwell in DMC while alkoxycarbonylation was successfully conducted\nin DMC and 2-MeTHF.333 Lastly, a\nvery recent report by Elorriaga and colleagues disclosed\na hybrid synthetic method in which an aluminum-catalyzed fixation\nof carbon dioxide in 2-MeTHF led to conversion of epoxides into tertiary\nalcohols.334 This process, catalyzed by\nAlEt2(κ2-bpzbdeape) (bpzbdeape = 1,1-bis(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)-2,2-bis(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethan-1-ol),\nresults in insertion of CO2 into one of the epoxide C–O\nbonds and subsequent ring expansion to form 5-membered cyclic carbonates\nin a near-quantitative yield. These cyclic carbonates, derived from\nthe structure of the starting epoxide, are then treated with 5 equiv\nof an alkyllithium reagent (e.g., EtLi), resulting in rapid conversion\nto the trialkyl alcohol. This methodology highlights an efficient\nmethod for the fixation of carbon dioxide to produce a range of highly\nsubstituted tertiary alcohols in one pot (Scheme 54).334\n\n## Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution (S\nNucleophilic aromatic substitution, or SNAr, is one of the most commonly used classes of reaction for\nsynthesis of aryl and heteroaryl ring systems, see Scheme 55.260 Because of the ease of reaction, including room temperature procedures,\nhigh-yielding transformations, and the ability to predict regioselectivity,335 the popularity of this reaction class has significantly\nincreased in the previous 30 years.260 Although\nthere are many examples using sustainable solvents in SNAr reactions, incidences using solvents such as 1,4-dioxane and THF\nare also prevalent within the literature.336,337 In the previous 5 years, a number of advances\nhave been made toward\nthe use of novel, sustainable solvents in nucleophilic aromatic substitution\nreactions (SNAr). In 2019, Szekely and co-workers discussed\nthe use of novel solvent PolarClean alongside other greener alternatives\n(GVL, Cyrene, and propylene carbonate) in a selection of reaction\nclasses including SNAr reactions.104 Using model reactions for the substitution of phenol or benzimidazole\non substrate bis(4-fluorophenyl) sulfone, comparisons between the\nsustainable solvents and more traditional alternatives of concern\n(DMAc, toluene) were explored, see Scheme 56. Using phenol, the more favorable alternatives\nperformed effectively compared to DMAc/toluene (86–92% compared\nto 70%) though were slightly less effective using benzimidazole (77–87%\ncompared to 97%), see Table 11. Studying the use of Cyrene-derived solvents such as\nthose falling\ninto the Cygnet class, Clark and colleagues at the University of York\nexplored the substitution of these solvents in nucleophilic aromatic\nfluorination reactions of pyridines.66 In\nthe study, which also involved use in other reaction classes, kinetic\ninvestigations in the fluorination of 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine using\na Cygnet 0.0 and a selection of dipolar aprotic solvents were carried\nout. Cygnet 0.0 resulted in higher reaction rates that MeCN and NMP,\nwith comparable rates to DMF.66 A small\nselection of publications in the previous 5 years have opted for a\nstraight solvent swap of the disfavored THF for the more sustainable\nalternative 2-MeTHF, mostly focusing on SNAr reactions\nfor medicinal chemistry applications. While investigating Buchwald-Hartwig\ncross-couplings, Buchwald and Smith discovered that in a small number\nof cases when coupling secondary amines with the model substrate,\nthe reaction in 2-MeTHF proceeded effectively under noncatalyzed conditions.338 In the design of a greener synthetic route\nto an EGFR receptor inhibitor, McWilliams and co-workers from Pfizer\nsubstituted THF for 2-MeTHF in a key SNAr step, yielding\nthe desired product in 90% yield, see Scheme 57.339 A report by Parmentier et al.\nin 2016 demonstrated the utility\nof surfactant-based amphiphiles in the synthesis of a pharmaceutically\nrelevant API.340 Looking to enhance the\nfirst generation route for synthesis, the group explored the use of\nTPGS-750-M in water over the 5-step synthesis, with the primary step\ninvolving an SNAr reaction of an amine fragment and an\n(hetero)aryl electrophile (structures likely withdrawn from the publication\ndue to intellectual property restraints). For this SNAr\nstep, a switch from organic solvents to a surfactant–water\nsystem resulted in a slightly diminished yield of 75% compared to\n87%, but for the overall 5-step route, the process mass intensity\n(PMI) of the process was decreased by 32%.340 More recently, Berteina-Raboin and co-workers explored the\nuse\nof the widely available PEG-400 (polyethylene glycol) as a solvent\nin nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, see Scheme 58.341 The reaction was shown to perform effectively, using a range of\naliphatic and aromatic amines, on medicinally relevant substrate classes\nincluding imidazo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines, and [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazines. For the wide ranging substrate scope, yields are\nreported in the range of 70–99%.341 Various PEG variants have also been successfully applied in many\nmetal-mediated reactions including oxidation, reduction, cross-coupling,\nand polymerization. This subject has been well reviewed by Colacino\net al.342 Often, organic solvents\ncan be replaced entirely from SNAr type chemistry. In 2013,\nWalsh et al. demonstrated that several\nSNAr reactions comprising heteroaryl chlorides such as\npyrimidine, pyrazine, and quinazoline could be conducted in water\nin the presence of KF. Surprisingly, several transformations that\nwere previously reported in the literature as requiring transition\nmetal catalysis were able to be conducted free from Pd.343\n\n## Organometallic Reactions\nOrganometallic-based\nreactions, such as those involving the use of alkyl lithium reagents,\nGrignard reagents, and metal hydride reductions, are commonly carried\nout in ethereal solvents and hydrocarbons due to the need for stability\nunder basic conditions.204,344 The most commonly\nused solvents within this class include diethyl ether, THF, and 1,4-dioxane,\nall of which are solvents of concern, see Figure 31.8 In recent\nyears, as a solution to the ongoing issues surrounding these solvents,\n2-MeTHF158,160 and CPME345 have\nboth been proposed as sustainable alternative solvents in a range\nof organometallic reactions, key examples of which will be discussed\nin this section. A number of commonly employed organometallic reagents\nare also now available as commercial preparations in alternative solvents\nsuch as 2-MeTHF.346 Organometallic reagents\nand their commonly employed ethereal solvents. 2-MeTHF\nhas been successfully utilized in a multitude of organometallic\nreactions, often acting as a “drop in” replacement for\nTHF or 1,4-dioxane. In 2010, Carbone et al. demonstrated that 2-MeTHF\ncould be used as solvent in asymmetric deprotonation reactions where\na chiral amine anion base is prepared in situ. Remarkably,\nthe chiral nature of the amine base is critical for enantioselectivity\nin asymmetric lithiation reactions when THF or 2-MeTHF are used as\nsolvent; anion bases derived from (−)-sparteine proceeded with\nlow enantioselectivity, whereas when a (+)-sparteine surrogate was\nemployed, excellent selectivity was observed.347 When MTBE was employed as solvent, excellent enantioselectivity\nwas observed for both sparteine bases, see Table 12 and Scheme 59. The selectivity is explained by the authors\nthrough a series of experiments investigating the solution phase dimerization\nand organization of the lithium base solvent complexes. The (+)-sparteine\nsurrogate used is (+)-(1R,2S,9S)-11-methyl-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7tridecane]. Mild, chemoselective N-TBS\nprotection of anilines\nhas been reported by Pace et al. using 2-MeTHF as a direct replacement\nfor THF. Under their optimized reaction conditions, TBS protection\nof aniline was conducted at 0 °C in just 30 min using MeLi and\nTBDMSCl in excellent yields (88–98%, 15 examples). Excellent\nchemoselectivity was also observed when iodo and bromo anilines were\nutilized as substrates; no lithium-halogen exchange was observed when\nusing 2-MeTHF as solvent but exchange did occur when using diethyl\nether. Finally, site selective TBS protection of aniline nitrogen\nover alkylamino nitrogen atoms was demonstrated, see Scheme 60. When using THF or diethyl\nether, a 1:1 mixture was observed. This remarkable selectivity has\nbeen proposed by the authors as being due to a reduction in the amount\nof highly polar amine dianion formed in 2-MeTHF due to the solvent’s\npolarity.348 Additionally, the authors\nundertook an examination of deprotection conditions showing that it\nwas possible to deprotect the TBS protected anilines in near quantitative\nyield in 2 h by simply stirring the compounds in a suspension of silica\ngel in an ethanol:water mixture (1:5). Note: −50 °C\nused here instead of 0 °C. The utility\nof 2-MeTHF in LiBr mediated selective 1,2-additions\nof organolithium reagents to α,β-unsaturated imines, ketones,\nand aldehydes to give a variety of allylic alcohols and amines has\nbeen demonstrated.349 Notably, no 1,4-addition\nproducts were detected by 1H NMR, and the reactions were\nconducted at 0 °C making this an attractively simple method.\nAnalogous reactions conducted in THF took longer and gave poorer yields\nwhen compared to 2-MeTHF (e.g., 6 h 79% yield vs 2 h quantitative\nyield for the 1,2 addition of MeLi to cyclohexenone), see Scheme 61. Other lithium base mediated reactions that have been successfully\nconducted in 2-MeTHF include preparations of γ-hydroxy-α,β-acetylenic\nesters using the base lithium tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP).350 Once more, Pace et al. have demonstrated the\nsuperior utility of 2-MeTHF through their exhaustive screening of\nhydrocarbon and ethereal solvents in the reaction of methyl-2-bromoacrylate\nwith benzaldehyde in the presence of a strong alkyllithium base, see Scheme 62. The 2-MeTHF gave\na 94% yield of the desired alcohol in just 1.5 h at −40 °C\ncompared to THF, which gave just 67% under the same conditions. Efficient access decorated four- and six-membered sulfur containing\nheterocycles (i.e., thietanes and thiopyrans) have also been achieved\nthrough a lithiation electrophile trapping strategy using 2-MeTHF\nas solvent, see Scheme 63. The 2-MeTHF was shown to improve regioselectivity considerably\nover THF.351 A wide range of benzylic and\naliphatic electrophiles were utilized, and varying degrees of electrophile\ndependent stereocontrol were observed. Other areas of organometallic chemistry in which 2-MeTHF has seen\nutility include zirconium chemistry such as that employing Schwartz’s\nreagent ((C5H5)2ZrHCl). Schwartz’s\nreagent in the presence of 2-MeTHF has been used to reduce isocyanates\nto formamides under mild conditions with excellent chemoselectivity\nand stereoretention of chiral substrates observed (room temperature,\n1 h), see Scheme 65.352 THF gave\nslightly poorer yields of about −5% during solvent screening\nreaction development. Similarly, Schwartz’s reagent can be\nutilized to reduce isothiocyanates to thioformamides.351 Electron withdrawing groups attached to the\naromatic isocyanates were also well tolerated including reactive functional\ngroups such as azo and azide motifs.353 The use of 2-MeTHF and the use of an in situ generated\nSchwartz reagent as the hydride source were crucial for obtaining\nhigh chemocontrol.354 Schwartz’s reagent\nis prepared in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and LiAl(O-t-Bu)3H, that is, Snieckus protocol. Subtle differences in the solubilizing and stabilizing\neffect of\n2-MeTHF have been effectively leveraged by Lelo et al., who have successfully\nemployed this solvent to promote α-elimination of lithium halide\nsalts to carbenoids, that is, Kirmse’s α-elimination.\nTaking advantage of the unique properties of 2-MeTHF, LiX salts have\nbeen degraded to carbenoids and reacted in situ with\nepoxides to give β-halohydrins. Employing THF or diethyl ether\nunder the same conditions helps to stabilize the lithium salts, and\nthe transformations were poorly accommodated by these more stabilizing\nsolvents.355 Other uses of ICH2X include the NaBH4-mediated reduction of diselenides\nin the presence of ICH2F to give α-fluoromethyl selenoethers.356 Synthesis of secondary amides from phenyl\nthiocarbamates and commercially\navailable Grignard reagents has been demonstrated by Mampuys et al.\nutilizing 2-MeTHF as solvent, see Scheme 66.357 Good to\nexcellent yields were observed across a wide variety of substrates\nincluding sterically hindered and electron-deficient compounds (Scheme 67). The Grignard reaction manifold\nrepresents a classical and key methodology\nfor C–C bond formation. Grignard reactions, at their simplest,\ninvolve the addition of an organomagnesium halide to a carbonyl\ncontaining molecule, forming a new C–C bond and an alcohol.\nThe reaction was discovered in 1900 by Victor Grignard, for which\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912.358 The reaction today is still widely employed and has even\nbeen conducted in the large scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and their intermediates.177 Grignard reactions have classically employed solvents of concern\nsuch as THF or diethyl ether, thus prompting the research group of\nZhang et al. to undertake a systematic study evaluating the performance\nof a variety of alternative and more sustainable solvents in Grignard-type\nreactions.177 It was demonstrated that\n2-MeTHF performed just as well or out-performed diethyl ether or THF\nin a wide variety of Grignard reactions including benzyl, aryl, and\nheteroaromatic Grignard reagents. CPME was also shown to be an appropriate\nsolvent when DIBAL-H instead of I2 was used as an initiator.\nA solvent comparison study for the formation of API tramadol was also\nconducted, see Scheme 64, with 2-MeTHF outperforming THF by +11% yield. After a performance\nevaluation and screening of solvents for a range of Grignard reactions,\nZhang et al. now recommend the use of 2-MeTHF as alternative solvent\nto Et2O and THF for the preparation of most Grignard reagents\nand their subsequent reactions, see Scheme 68. They noted that the use of 2-MeTHF was\nequal if not superior in suppressing the Wurtz coupling byproduct\nfrom benzyl Grignard reactions, see Table 13.177 The use of Reformatsky reagents in the large-scale synthesis of\nvarious enantiopure N-tert-butanesulfinyl trifluoromethyl\nβ-amino esters from bench-stable analogues of aliphatic and\naromatic trifluoromethyl N-tert-butanesulfinyl ketoimines\nwas reported by Grellepois, see Scheme 69. During optimization studies, it was found\nthat 2-MeTHF was the best solvent.359 The synthesis of enantioenriched\nalcohols via the Corey-Baskshi-Shibata\n(CBS) oxazaborolidine-mediated reduction of prochiral ketones was\ncarried out by Luisi and co-workers using a combination of flow technology\nand 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 70. The optimized conditions gave the desired asymmetric products\nin yields of up to 99% and 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), with a reaction\nduration 10 min.360 CPME, as discussed preciously in section 2, has been available\nin commercially useful\nquantities since 2005165 and has been utilized\nin a wide variety of reaction classes including organometallic mediated\ntransformations. A selection of examples highlighting some of the\nbreadth and scope of CPME employment in organometallic reactions will\nbe discussed in this section. In 2007, Okabayashi et al. developed\na facile method for the regio- and stereoselective preparation of\nketene trimethylsilyl acetals (KSAs) from t-butyl\nesters or ketoesters using strong bases such as LDA and NaHMDS, in\nconjunction with TMSCl, and CPME as solvent. The reactions were conducted\nunder mild conditions, 0–5 °C, 2.5 h and produced both\n(E)-KSAs and 1,3-bis(TMS)-KSAs, see Scheme 71.361 α-Oxygen and α -nitrogen-substituted t-butyl esters were also shown to be compatible with this methodology.\nDuring solvent screening for reaction condition optimization, it was\nshown that other ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, THF, 1,4-dioxane,\nand dimethoxyethane led to poor regioselectivity and C-silylation, whereas CPME by comparison outperformed all of these\nsolvents. CPME has also seen use as a\ncosolvent in conjunction with THF,\nsee Scheme 72. Takeda\net al. demonstrated that CPME was critical for a titanocene-mediated\nketone allylation strategy that gave access to alkyl systems containing\nadjacent stereocenters in high yield and high diastereoselectivity.362 CPME has also been used as a co-solvent (in\nconjunction with toluene) by researchers at Novartis who employed\nthe solvent as a stabilizer for a Grignard reagent during a reaction\nsequence.363 The stabilizing effect of CPME was once again\nexploited by Molander\net al. during their reaction optimization for the synthesis of azaborines.\nA 1:1 mixture of CPME:toluene was discovered to be optimum.364 Azaborines represent an important and emerging\nclass of potential isosteric replacements for traditional carbon containing\nheterocycles, and the methodology developed, Scheme 73, has allowed for facile synthesis using,\nat least in part, a more contemporary solvent. The Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is a classical\nmethod for the\nsynthesis of cyclopropanes from alkenes via insertion of a zinc carbene,\nsee Scheme 74. THF\nor diethyl ether is most often employed as solvent in this reaction\nmanifold, and in 2013, Fujii et al. conducted solvent screening to\ndetermine whether other alternative ethers could be used. It was demonstrated\nthat reactions conducted using CPME went to completion up to ten-times\nfaster than those in diethyl ether with no loss in product yield or\nselectivity. Yield improvements in some cases were also noted.365 In 2015, Pace et al. demonstrated that CPME was the optimum\nsolvent\nfor their synthesis of thioamides from the corresponding isothiocyanate\nand lithium reagent, see Scheme 75. Solvent screening showed CPME to be superior to traditional\nethers such as THF and diethyl ether and even outperformed 2-MeTHF\nin terms of yield. The methodology reported provides robust and efficient\naccess to secondary thioamides from commercially available isothiocyanates\nand includes examples where chiral isothiocyanates or organolithium\nreagents have been used to form enantiopure products with excellent\nselectivity. In 2016, a thorough investigation into the use\nof CPME in Grignard\nreactions was conducted by Kobayashi et al., see Scheme 76.345 It was shown that CPME can be used in place of THF to great effect\nand that DIBALH was the most effective method of activating the Mg\nwhen using CPME as solvent. Efficient solvent recycling of CPME was\nalso demonstrated with no loss of yield observed. Promisingly, CPME\nwas shown to be stable to Grignard reagents during long-term storage\nwith no solvent degradation observed. Furthermore, Grignard reagent\nstability in CPME was often in the order of many months; thus, CPME\ncould be used in commercial preparations of Grignard reagents.345\n\n## Organometallic Reactions Employing 2-MeTHF\n2-MeTHF\nhas been successfully utilized in a multitude of organometallic\nreactions, often acting as a “drop in” replacement for\nTHF or 1,4-dioxane. In 2010, Carbone et al. demonstrated that 2-MeTHF\ncould be used as solvent in asymmetric deprotonation reactions where\na chiral amine anion base is prepared in situ. Remarkably,\nthe chiral nature of the amine base is critical for enantioselectivity\nin asymmetric lithiation reactions when THF or 2-MeTHF are used as\nsolvent; anion bases derived from (−)-sparteine proceeded with\nlow enantioselectivity, whereas when a (+)-sparteine surrogate was\nemployed, excellent selectivity was observed.347 When MTBE was employed as solvent, excellent enantioselectivity\nwas observed for both sparteine bases, see Table 12 and Scheme 59. The selectivity is explained by the authors\nthrough a series of experiments investigating the solution phase dimerization\nand organization of the lithium base solvent complexes. The (+)-sparteine\nsurrogate used is (+)-(1R,2S,9S)-11-methyl-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7tridecane]. Mild, chemoselective N-TBS\nprotection of anilines\nhas been reported by Pace et al. using 2-MeTHF as a direct replacement\nfor THF. Under their optimized reaction conditions, TBS protection\nof aniline was conducted at 0 °C in just 30 min using MeLi and\nTBDMSCl in excellent yields (88–98%, 15 examples). Excellent\nchemoselectivity was also observed when iodo and bromo anilines were\nutilized as substrates; no lithium-halogen exchange was observed when\nusing 2-MeTHF as solvent but exchange did occur when using diethyl\nether. Finally, site selective TBS protection of aniline nitrogen\nover alkylamino nitrogen atoms was demonstrated, see Scheme 60. When using THF or diethyl\nether, a 1:1 mixture was observed. This remarkable selectivity has\nbeen proposed by the authors as being due to a reduction in the amount\nof highly polar amine dianion formed in 2-MeTHF due to the solvent’s\npolarity.348 Additionally, the authors\nundertook an examination of deprotection conditions showing that it\nwas possible to deprotect the TBS protected anilines in near quantitative\nyield in 2 h by simply stirring the compounds in a suspension of silica\ngel in an ethanol:water mixture (1:5). Note: −50 °C\nused here instead of 0 °C. The utility\nof 2-MeTHF in LiBr mediated selective 1,2-additions\nof organolithium reagents to α,β-unsaturated imines, ketones,\nand aldehydes to give a variety of allylic alcohols and amines has\nbeen demonstrated.349 Notably, no 1,4-addition\nproducts were detected by 1H NMR, and the reactions were\nconducted at 0 °C making this an attractively simple method.\nAnalogous reactions conducted in THF took longer and gave poorer yields\nwhen compared to 2-MeTHF (e.g., 6 h 79% yield vs 2 h quantitative\nyield for the 1,2 addition of MeLi to cyclohexenone), see Scheme 61. Other lithium base mediated reactions that have been successfully\nconducted in 2-MeTHF include preparations of γ-hydroxy-α,β-acetylenic\nesters using the base lithium tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP).350 Once more, Pace et al. have demonstrated the\nsuperior utility of 2-MeTHF through their exhaustive screening of\nhydrocarbon and ethereal solvents in the reaction of methyl-2-bromoacrylate\nwith benzaldehyde in the presence of a strong alkyllithium base, see Scheme 62. The 2-MeTHF gave\na 94% yield of the desired alcohol in just 1.5 h at −40 °C\ncompared to THF, which gave just 67% under the same conditions. Efficient access decorated four- and six-membered sulfur containing\nheterocycles (i.e., thietanes and thiopyrans) have also been achieved\nthrough a lithiation electrophile trapping strategy using 2-MeTHF\nas solvent, see Scheme 63. The 2-MeTHF was shown to improve regioselectivity considerably\nover THF.351 A wide range of benzylic and\naliphatic electrophiles were utilized, and varying degrees of electrophile\ndependent stereocontrol were observed. Other areas of organometallic chemistry in which 2-MeTHF has seen\nutility include zirconium chemistry such as that employing Schwartz’s\nreagent ((C5H5)2ZrHCl). Schwartz’s\nreagent in the presence of 2-MeTHF has been used to reduce isocyanates\nto formamides under mild conditions with excellent chemoselectivity\nand stereoretention of chiral substrates observed (room temperature,\n1 h), see Scheme 65.352 THF gave\nslightly poorer yields of about −5% during solvent screening\nreaction development. Similarly, Schwartz’s reagent can be\nutilized to reduce isothiocyanates to thioformamides.351 Electron withdrawing groups attached to the\naromatic isocyanates were also well tolerated including reactive functional\ngroups such as azo and azide motifs.353 The use of 2-MeTHF and the use of an in situ generated\nSchwartz reagent as the hydride source were crucial for obtaining\nhigh chemocontrol.354 Schwartz’s reagent\nis prepared in situ from Cp2ZrCl2 and LiAl(O-t-Bu)3H, that is, Snieckus protocol. Subtle differences in the solubilizing and stabilizing\neffect of\n2-MeTHF have been effectively leveraged by Lelo et al., who have successfully\nemployed this solvent to promote α-elimination of lithium halide\nsalts to carbenoids, that is, Kirmse’s α-elimination.\nTaking advantage of the unique properties of 2-MeTHF, LiX salts have\nbeen degraded to carbenoids and reacted in situ with\nepoxides to give β-halohydrins. Employing THF or diethyl ether\nunder the same conditions helps to stabilize the lithium salts, and\nthe transformations were poorly accommodated by these more stabilizing\nsolvents.355 Other uses of ICH2X include the NaBH4-mediated reduction of diselenides\nin the presence of ICH2F to give α-fluoromethyl selenoethers.356 Synthesis of secondary amides from phenyl\nthiocarbamates and commercially\navailable Grignard reagents has been demonstrated by Mampuys et al.\nutilizing 2-MeTHF as solvent, see Scheme 66.357 Good to\nexcellent yields were observed across a wide variety of substrates\nincluding sterically hindered and electron-deficient compounds (Scheme 67). The Grignard reaction manifold\nrepresents a classical and key methodology\nfor C–C bond formation. Grignard reactions, at their simplest,\ninvolve the addition of an organomagnesium halide to a carbonyl\ncontaining molecule, forming a new C–C bond and an alcohol.\nThe reaction was discovered in 1900 by Victor Grignard, for which\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912.358 The reaction today is still widely employed and has even\nbeen conducted in the large scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical\ningredients and their intermediates.177 Grignard reactions have classically employed solvents of concern\nsuch as THF or diethyl ether, thus prompting the research group of\nZhang et al. to undertake a systematic study evaluating the performance\nof a variety of alternative and more sustainable solvents in Grignard-type\nreactions.177 It was demonstrated that\n2-MeTHF performed just as well or out-performed diethyl ether or THF\nin a wide variety of Grignard reactions including benzyl, aryl, and\nheteroaromatic Grignard reagents. CPME was also shown to be an appropriate\nsolvent when DIBAL-H instead of I2 was used as an initiator.\nA solvent comparison study for the formation of API tramadol was also\nconducted, see Scheme 64, with 2-MeTHF outperforming THF by +11% yield. After a performance\nevaluation and screening of solvents for a range of Grignard reactions,\nZhang et al. now recommend the use of 2-MeTHF as alternative solvent\nto Et2O and THF for the preparation of most Grignard reagents\nand their subsequent reactions, see Scheme 68. They noted that the use of 2-MeTHF was\nequal if not superior in suppressing the Wurtz coupling byproduct\nfrom benzyl Grignard reactions, see Table 13.177 The use of Reformatsky reagents in the large-scale synthesis of\nvarious enantiopure N-tert-butanesulfinyl trifluoromethyl\nβ-amino esters from bench-stable analogues of aliphatic and\naromatic trifluoromethyl N-tert-butanesulfinyl ketoimines\nwas reported by Grellepois, see Scheme 69. During optimization studies, it was found\nthat 2-MeTHF was the best solvent.359 The synthesis of enantioenriched\nalcohols via the Corey-Baskshi-Shibata\n(CBS) oxazaborolidine-mediated reduction of prochiral ketones was\ncarried out by Luisi and co-workers using a combination of flow technology\nand 2-MeTHF, see Scheme 70. The optimized conditions gave the desired asymmetric products\nin yields of up to 99% and 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), with a reaction\nduration 10 min.360\n\n## Organometallic Reactions\nEmploying CPME\nCPME, as discussed preciously in section 2, has been available\nin commercially useful\nquantities since 2005165 and has been utilized\nin a wide variety of reaction classes including organometallic mediated\ntransformations. A selection of examples highlighting some of the\nbreadth and scope of CPME employment in organometallic reactions will\nbe discussed in this section. In 2007, Okabayashi et al. developed\na facile method for the regio- and stereoselective preparation of\nketene trimethylsilyl acetals (KSAs) from t-butyl\nesters or ketoesters using strong bases such as LDA and NaHMDS, in\nconjunction with TMSCl, and CPME as solvent. The reactions were conducted\nunder mild conditions, 0–5 °C, 2.5 h and produced both\n(E)-KSAs and 1,3-bis(TMS)-KSAs, see Scheme 71.361 α-Oxygen and α -nitrogen-substituted t-butyl esters were also shown to be compatible with this methodology.\nDuring solvent screening for reaction condition optimization, it was\nshown that other ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, THF, 1,4-dioxane,\nand dimethoxyethane led to poor regioselectivity and C-silylation, whereas CPME by comparison outperformed all of these\nsolvents. CPME has also seen use as a\ncosolvent in conjunction with THF,\nsee Scheme 72. Takeda\net al. demonstrated that CPME was critical for a titanocene-mediated\nketone allylation strategy that gave access to alkyl systems containing\nadjacent stereocenters in high yield and high diastereoselectivity.362 CPME has also been used as a co-solvent (in\nconjunction with toluene) by researchers at Novartis who employed\nthe solvent as a stabilizer for a Grignard reagent during a reaction\nsequence.363 The stabilizing effect of CPME was once again\nexploited by Molander\net al. during their reaction optimization for the synthesis of azaborines.\nA 1:1 mixture of CPME:toluene was discovered to be optimum.364 Azaborines represent an important and emerging\nclass of potential isosteric replacements for traditional carbon containing\nheterocycles, and the methodology developed, Scheme 73, has allowed for facile synthesis using,\nat least in part, a more contemporary solvent. The Simmons-Smith cyclopropanation is a classical\nmethod for the\nsynthesis of cyclopropanes from alkenes via insertion of a zinc carbene,\nsee Scheme 74. THF\nor diethyl ether is most often employed as solvent in this reaction\nmanifold, and in 2013, Fujii et al. conducted solvent screening to\ndetermine whether other alternative ethers could be used. It was demonstrated\nthat reactions conducted using CPME went to completion up to ten-times\nfaster than those in diethyl ether with no loss in product yield or\nselectivity. Yield improvements in some cases were also noted.365 In 2015, Pace et al. demonstrated that CPME was the optimum\nsolvent\nfor their synthesis of thioamides from the corresponding isothiocyanate\nand lithium reagent, see Scheme 75. Solvent screening showed CPME to be superior to traditional\nethers such as THF and diethyl ether and even outperformed 2-MeTHF\nin terms of yield. The methodology reported provides robust and efficient\naccess to secondary thioamides from commercially available isothiocyanates\nand includes examples where chiral isothiocyanates or organolithium\nreagents have been used to form enantiopure products with excellent\nselectivity. In 2016, a thorough investigation into the use\nof CPME in Grignard\nreactions was conducted by Kobayashi et al., see Scheme 76.345 It was shown that CPME can be used in place of THF to great effect\nand that DIBALH was the most effective method of activating the Mg\nwhen using CPME as solvent. Efficient solvent recycling of CPME was\nalso demonstrated with no loss of yield observed. Promisingly, CPME\nwas shown to be stable to Grignard reagents during long-term storage\nwith no solvent degradation observed. Furthermore, Grignard reagent\nstability in CPME was often in the order of many months; thus, CPME\ncould be used in commercial preparations of Grignard reagents.345\n\n## Urea Synthesis\nUreas are used\nin agrochemicals, and in the pharmaceutical industry where they are\nfound in areas such as antibiotics, antimalarial compounds, antimicrobials,\nand many others. They have also been utilized as catalysts, ligands,\nand solvents, see Scheme 77. A greener, mild, and efficient\napproach for the synthesis of ureas,\nfrom isocyanates and secondary amines, was developed by Camp and co-workers\nusing the bioalternative solvent Cyrene, see Scheme 78.88 This method\nremoves the use of toxic solvents such as DMF, which has been used\nin the traditional synthesis of ureas. A simple workup procedure for\nthe removal of Cyrene was also established by the addition of water,\nwhich led to precipitation of the desired urea. The substrate scope\nof both the amine and isocyanate was investigated.\n\n## Steglich-type Esterification\nSteglich\nesterification remains a commonly employed technique for the mild\nsynthesis of esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols or thiols.184,367 This methodology employs coupling reagents often encountered in\namide bond formation such as carbodiimides and relies heavily on either\nDCM or DMF as solvents of choice.8,367 Solvent-reagent\nselection guides for both ester and thioester synthesis have been\ndeveloped by Jordan et al. and effectively demonstrate the effective\nreplacement of dipolar aprotic solvents with safer, more sustainable\nalternatives, see Scheme 79. For the formation of thioesters from acids and thiols,\nit was found\nthat coupling reagent T3P in conjunction with solvent cyclopentanone\ngave good to excellent yields across a variety of building-block-like\nmolecules, often with rapid reaction times of just 1 h, see Scheme 79 (left). 2-MeTHF,\nEtOAc, DMC, and CPME were also shown to be viable alternatives, though\nless general in their applicability/compatibility to the substrates\nscreened.184 A solvent-reagent guide\nfor ester formation from alcohols and acids\nhas also been recently developed. In this study, a high-throughput\napproach allowed for the simultaneous identification of alternative\nsolvent DMC in conjunction with safer coupling reagent 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium\niodide (Mukaiyama’s reagent). Further optimized conditions\nwere identified from the initial screen and then successfully applied\nin the synthesis of a selection of building-block-like molecules,\nsee Scheme 79 (right).\nIn both studies, less desirable polar aprotic solvents were successfully\nreplaced with greener, safer, more sustainable alternatives. Steglich esterification in water has also been demonstrated by\nFattahi et al. using DIC as coupling reagent, though the methodology\nis limited to phenolic alcohols due to their lower pKa when compared to aliphatic alcohols in water.265\n\n## Solid Phase Peptide\nSynthesis (SPPS)\nA range of peptide-based compounds are widely\nused globally, including\nclinically used hormones such as oxytocin, and peptide therapeutics.\nFrom 2015–2019, 208 new drugs were approved by the FDA, 15\nof which were peptides or peptide-containing molecules (7%).370 The increasing proportion of therapeutics falling\ninto the peptides category has been accompanied by a need for more\nsustainable methods for the solid phase synthesis of peptides (SPPS),\nsee Scheme 80. Commonly\nused solvents for SPPS fall within the reprotoxic dipolar aprotics\ncategory, being DMF, DMAc, and NMP.371 The\nchallenges in improving the sustainability in peptide synthesis and\npurification are well reviewed by Isidro-Llobet et al.372 Recently, a number of publications have aimed\nto move away from\nreprotoxic dipolar aprotic solvents in solid phase peptide synthesis,\nswitching to more sustainable alternatives. The work of Lawrenson\net al. has successfully demonstrated the use of propylene carbonate\nas a safer, more sustainable alternative to polar aprotic solvents\nsuch as DMF or NMP. In their publication, both SPPS and solution phase\nmethodology were successfully demonstrated using propylene carbonate\nas solvent with no significant impact on racemization of the amino\nacid (AA) observed. Synthesis of nonapeptide “Bradykinin”\nwas also demonstrated. NBP was identified by Novartis in 2018\nduring a systematic examination\nof 34 alternative solvents shortlisted as potential DMF replacements\nin SPPS.222 A number of parameters were\nexamined including solvent ability to swell resin, solubility of SPPS\nreagents, and reaction performance including Fmoc deprotection steps.\nNBP was successfully demonstrated as a viable drop-in replacement\nfor DMF; NBP was successfully used as the solvent during the SPPS\nsynthesis of an octapeptide with comparable yield and purity to that\nof DMF (93% yield NBP vs >99% DMF, 80% purity NBP vs 86% DMF).\nOne\nmajor point of difference was highlighted: NBP is more viscous than\nDMF (4.0 cP vs 0.8 cP) and makes for slower fluid transfer steps during\nsmaller scale SPPS operations.222 Two reports were published in 2020 in which the solvent NBP was\nused in place of traditional solvents. Kumar et al. have successfully\ndemonstrated the use of NBP as a replacement for DMF and NMP SPPS\noperations using both in situ activation and preactivation\nstrategies. Less racemization was observed for reactions conducted\nin NBP, and a reduction in the generation of side-products when forcing\nconditions were utilized was also observed. Thus, NBP has been demonstrated\nas a superior alternative to both DMF and NMP in this study.373 De la Torre et al. report the successful\nuse of NBP in an SPPS\nsequence employing problematic amino acid residue Fmoc-Arg (Pbf)–OH;\npbf = (2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl group).\nThe amino acid residue is particularly troublesome due to its propensity\nto react intramolecularly leading to δ-lactam side product.\nA systematic analysis of reaction conditions allowed for the identification\nof optimum conditions, and NBP was shown to be an excellent alternative\nsolvent to DMF, with levels of amino acid incorporation into the peptide\nbackbone approaching 100%. Purity of the crude peptides was also similar.374 From a safety perspective, it has been\nreported by Erny et al.\nthat the levels of HCN produced in DIC/Oxyma mediate amide bond forming\nreactions can be significantly reduced when a mixture of NBP:EtOAc\n1:4 is employed.375 In conjunction with\ndimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) as a HCN scrubbing additive, the authors\nsuggest that with further developments, the implementation of this\nmethodology combining greener solvents and HCN-free synthesis could\nbe applied to the industrial manufacturing of peptides. Other\nthan NBP, GVL has also been proposed as a potential alternative\nsolvent in SPPS. The group of Albericio and co-workers illustrated\nthat GVL could be utilized in polystyrene (PS)-based SPPS. GVL showed\nexcellent coupling efficiencies in both the synthesis of a pentapeptide\n(Aib-enkephalin) and decapeptide (Aib-ACP), with no major side products\nor ring opening products detected.376 A\nfollow-up to this work was published in 2019 demonstrating the effectiveness\nof GVL in Wang resin SPPS; DCM was effectively replaced as an alternative\nsolvent for the initial anchoring to the Wang resin. Subsequent elongation\nof the peptide was also successfully conducted in GVL with racemization\nand dipeptide formation found to be within acceptable levels.377 Both publications also note the compatibility\nof Fmoc residues in GVL. Most recently, Leko et al. have demonstrated\nthat a combination of EtOAc/CH3CN can be used in chlorotrityl\nchloride and 4-methylbenzhydryl bromide resin loading operations\nwith loading levels comparable to that when DCM, THF, 2-MeTHF, or\nDMF was utilized.378\n\n## Biocatalysis\nIn recent years,\nthere has been a significant expansion in the field of biocatalysis,\ncommonly using water as a solvent or cosolvent. However, there are\na number of problems associated with the use of water as a solvent\nin biocatalysis, even though it is readily available, is nonhazardous,\nand does not have the flammability or explosion risks associated with\norganic solvents.379 Many synthetically\nuseful reagents, those that are of interest in biocatalytic transformations,\nare poorly water-soluble, which in turn results in a requirement of\nextremely dilute reaction mixtures, leading to increased solvent use.\nThere has been a recent drive for discovery of enzymatic reactions\ncompatible with sustainable organic solvents, most notably 2-MeTHF380 and CPME.168 The most expansive class of enzymatic reaction using 2-MeTHF is that\nof hydrolases, mostly in stereoselective acylations for kinetic resolutions\nof racemates.381−383 In 2017, Secundo and co-workers reported\nthe use of 2-MeTHF in the esterification of a range of natural products\n(menthol, rac-sulcatol and rac-α-cyclogeraniol)\nusing a range of commercial lipases.384 2-MeTHF, as well as CPME, performed well compared to traditional\nsolvents such as toluene and MTBE, with high enantioselectivity. A\nsimilar enzymatic acylation of racemic benzoin in 2-MeTHF, reported\nby Alcántara and colleagues in 2011, using Pseudomonas\nstutzeri lipase (PSL) and Shvo’s catalyst, led to\nkinetic resolution over 48 h, in a 85% yield and 99% e.e. (Scheme 81).385 Numerous additional examples are also found\nwithin the literature using 2-MeTHF as an alternative bio-based solvent,\ntargeting selective acylations of glycosides.386−390 Away from kinetic resolutions, Pseudomonas stutzeri lipase (PSL) has additionally be used as an effective catalyst in\namination reactions of esters, reported by Wong et al. in 2011.391 Shown to form a wide range of alkyl and aryl\namides, 2-MeTHF was reportedly selected due to a high solubilizing\nability of the organic starting materials, with MTBE also shown to\nperform effectively in the transformation. A selection of papers\nusing 2-MeTHF as a bio-based solvent, for\naccessing chiral α-hydroxyketones through either carboligation392,393 or domino enzymatic reactions,394 have\nalso been reported. The first of which, by Domínquez de María\nin 2010, involved use of 2-MeTHF as a (co)solvent alternative to DMSO\nor MTBE for enantioselective C–C bond formation between aldehydes.\nCatalyzed by a thiamine diphosphate-dependent lyase (ThDP-Lyase),\nan efficient enantioselective carboligation of aldehydes to furnish\nchiral α-hydroxyketones was described, providing products in\n>90% yield and generally >95% e.e. (Scheme 82a). A similar report by Rother and co-workers\nin 2012 also used ThDP-Lyase for the umpolung carboligation\nof acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde, examining the relative product distribution\nof the eight possible enantiomeric products.393 (a) Carboligation of aldehydes\nto produce chiral α-hydroxyketones. (b) Domino enzymatic process\nfor the preparation of 2-HPP, with in situ generation\nof acetaldehyde via kinetic resolution. This\nwas further followed up in 2012 by a domino enzymatic cascade\nusing an aldehyde and butyrate or laurate substrate, in the presence\nof Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) and benzaldehyde\nlyase (BAL).394 An initial conversion of\nthe vinyl ester into acetaldehyde, followed by a subsequent C–C\nbond formation with benzaldehyde, catalyzed by BAL, furnished (R)-2-hydroxypropriophenone (2-HPP) in quantitative\nconversion and >99% e.e. (Scheme 82b). Although the majority of biocatalytic transformations\ncarried out\nin organic solvents such as 2-MeTHF fall under the hydrolases class\ndue to their high robustness, a small number of other enzymes are\nalso compatible. In 2014, metagenome screening by Kurokawa and colleagues\nidentified a dehydrogenase enzyme, homologous Leifsoniaadh alcohol\ndehydrogenase (HLADH), which was able to effectively reduce a selection\nof ketones, with high tolerance to 2-MeTHF, in excellent (generally\n>99%) enantiomeric excess.395 Similar\nketone\nreductions have been reported, for example, using YOL151W reductase396 and KREDs (Scheme 83).397 Other than 2-MeTHF, a solvent\n(or cosolvent) that has demonstrated\npotential within biocatalytic transformations is cyclopentyl methyl\nether (CPME). CPME, similar to 2-MeTHF, has proven effective in kinetic\nresolution, such as the one reported by González-Sabín\nand co-workers in 2017.398 As part of a\nkey step in the synthesis of Ivabradine, a drug used for the treatment\nof stable angina pectoris, alkoxycarbonylation kinetic resolution\nof an amine precursor was carried out using the lipase PSC-II and\ndiethylcarbonate, yielding the desired (S)-enantiomer\nin 30% yield, 92% e.e. (Scheme 84). The utility of CPME as a solvent in the reduction of imine-type\nfunctionalities, using IREDs (imine reductases), was reported by Rother\nand Maugeri in 2016.399 Reduction of cyclic\nC=N functionalities using whole cells containing Streptomyces\naurantiacus and Paenibacillus elgii B69\ngave an e.r. of >99:1 under micro aqueous reaction conditions (Scheme 85).\n\n## Future Directions for Development\nof More Sustainable\nSolvents and Processes\nThe future direction for organic synthesis\nas a whole will most\nlikely involve a steady transition away from petrochemical-based solvents\nand unsustainable practices. Dwindling palladium stocks and rising\npalladium prices (+2170% in 25 years)400 are surely challenges that will face us all as chemists in the near\nfuture. Even more concerning is the inextricable link between crude\noil price and availability with organic solvent and raw material cost,\nfor example, “oil-price shocks”. Surely it is time for\nus to start to free ourselves from our reliance on petrochemical-derived\nsolvents? The alternatives will likely comprise a combination\nof sustainably\nsourced organic solvents and aqueous–micellar systems. One\ncan envision conventional solvents being retained only for those instances\nwhere no viable alternative has yet been found. What is certain at\nthis time is that there are more than enough evidence, case studies,\nand real world examples to start to promote the early adoption of\nalternative solvent systems. Sometimes a “drop-in” solvent\nreplacement may be sufficient to migrate away from solvents of concern;\nother times a solvent mixture may be more appropriate. Research is\nalso being conducted into the identification of new solvents such\nas 4-MeTHP,401 or TMO,116 or the creation of brand new solvents such as Cyrene.122 Finally, when solvent selection options\nare exhausted, finding\nnew ways of doing things will be critical for moving forward. Telescoping\nreaction steps into “one-pot” methods and utilizing\ncascades, tandem and domino reactions, and multicomponent reactions\nwill surely allow for more efficient synthesis since only one reaction\nmedium is required for multiple steps/transformations.402 Late-stage functionalization also represents\nan enormously powerful technique in opening up more efficient routes\nto targets or even allowing access to targets that might previously\nhave been impossible to make. However, as has been previously demonstrated,\nthe literature’s over reliance on DCE for these reactions is\ntroublesome, and it is the pioneering work from groups such as Ackermann\net al. that will steer the C–H activation community away from\nunsustainable solvent practices. The utilization of enzymatic catalysis\nin organic synthesis will also become more commonplace as the gap\nbetween biology and chemistry narrows and overlaps, for example, see\nthe recent synthesis of Molnupiravir in a 3-step enzymatic cascade\nto produce the COVID-19 antiviral in 69% yield. In this process, a\ncombination of aqueous buffered reaction media and 2-MeTHF as extraction\nsolvent shows that a multidisciplinary approach to sustainability\nmay become more commonplace. The transition away from unsustainable\nsolvent usage practices\nand processes has already begun, and challenges have been identified\nand are gradually being overcome. One case study is the adoption of\nCPME in process chemistry and industry; due to CPME being only available\nfrom one supplier (Zeon), supply chain robustness has been a concern.\nCPME was also absent from the ICH Q3C guidelines for residual solvents\nin APIs. ICH, or the “International Council For Harmonisation\nOf Technical Requirements For Pharmaceuticals For Human Use”\nguidelines are the de facto rules for solvent usage\nand residual solvent levels in API in pharmaceutical manufacturing.\nBecause of this absence in the early days of CPME use, justification\nfor residual levels of CPME would have to be provided, which may have\nbeen deemed to be too costly and time-consuming for the potential\nsustainability improvements achieved.352 CPME is now included in the guidance as of 2020/21.353 Therefore, it is imperative that regulatory\nupdates and guidance are carried out in a time frame that supports\nthe rapidly progressing developments in greener, more sustainable\nprocesses. Responsibility for training new generations of chemists\nis also\ncritical for the successful transition toward more sustainable organic\nsynthesis practices. It is no coincidence that the current generation\nof organic chemists relies so heavily on DMF, THF, and 1,4-dioxane\nas reaction media, after all it is how we were taught and it became\nthe norm. By introducing safer, more sustainable solvents and synthetic\ntechniques into teaching laboratories and organic synthesis lecture\ncourses, the upcoming generation of chemists stands a chance of adopting\nthese practices and challenging the status quo. Support for these\nendeavors will also have to come from top levels of organizations\nto stand a chance of becoming policy and not just personal choice.\nTo quote from Bruce Lipshutz, “the “business as usual”\nmentality is no longer appropriate”.236\n\n## Conclusion\nThe case for moving away from\ntraditionally employed solvents such\nas DMF, NMP, and 1,4-dioxane is growing as evidence reinforces the\npotential hazards that currently employed solvents can inflict on\nusers and the environment. The motivation to move toward safer, greener,\nmore sustainable alternatives to those currently in use has never\nbeen clearer. In synthetic organic chemistry, migrating from solvents\nthat carry reproductive toxicity warnings toward those that do not\nis now a real possibility across a wide range of reaction types. To assist chemists in industrial and academic settings alike in\nmaking more informed solvent selection, we have provided a clear depiction\nof the current state-of-the-art in the field of potential replacement\nsolvents, their production, and their uses. In addition, the physicochemical\nproperties of a selection of dipolar aprotic and ethereal solvents\nhave been compiled to assist in more judicious solvent selection.\nFinally, real world examples and case studies where solvents of concern\nhave been successfully replaced have been compiled and presented to\nreinforce the ideology that solvent moving toward safer, more sustainable\nalternatives can provide end results that are just as good, if not\nbetter, than the current status quo. It is our hope that the information\nwithin this review will aid and assist chemists from many disciplines\nin moving toward a more sustainable future for chemistry as a whole.",
