  "abstract": "The study aimed to comprehensively investigate environmental pollutants’ potential toxicity and underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on chronic urticaria (CU) induced by butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) exposure, further drawing public awareness regarding the potential risks of environmental pollutants, applying ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases to predict the targets of BHA, CTD, GeneCards, and OMIM databases to collect the relevant targets of CU. Ultimately, we identified 81 potential targets of BHA-induced CU and extracted 31 core targets, including TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that these core targets were predominantly involved in cancer signaling, estrogen and endocrine resistance pathways. Furthermore, molecular docking confirmed the ability of BHA to bind with core targets. The onset and development of CU may result from BHA by affecting multiple immune signaling pathways. Our study elucidated the molecular mechanisms of BHA toxicity and its role in CU induction, providing the basis for preventing and treating chronic urticaria associated with environmental BHA exposure.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Chronic urticaria (CU) is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by mast cells, characterized by persistent or recurrent wheezing (hives), angioedema (swelling), or both, lasting at least six weeks [ 1 ]. It affects approximately 1 % of the population in the United States and Europe, with a prevalence of 0.23 % in the United States alone. CU is more prevalent among women and typically manifests in individuals over the age of 40 [ 2 , 3 ]. Several factors can trigger CU, and a study has shown that CU is associated with aeroallergens [ 4 ], although mechanisms are limited.\n\nAlong with the rapid development of industrial chemistry, human reliance on industrial chemicals has grown, yet concerns persist over their biosafety and environmental impacts. Plastic additives, such as plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, surfactants, and pigments, are commonly integrated into plastics for superior performance. However, these additives can easily leach into the environment, particularly during processes like plastic crushing [ 5 ]. It is crucial to assess the potential health risks associated with these pollutants using effective methods.\n\nButylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) serves as an additive not only in plastics but also in food preservatives, food packaging, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and rubber products [ 6 ]. It is classified as safe and approved as a preservative in the European Union and the United States but is prohibited in Japan [ 7 ]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has evaluated BHA as a possible human carcinogen, and BHA has also been reported as an environmental endocrine disruptor [ 8 ]. It has been reported that BHA in the aqueous phase could be further converted to 2-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TBQ), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), etc., which have significantly increased eco-toxicity and are toxic to aquatic organisms [ 9 ]. Research has shown that BHA reduces hatchability, calcifies vertebrae, and increases malformations in zebrafish. It may also interfere with the secretion of estrogen and the homeostasis of steroid hormones [ 10 , 11 ]. Adverse effects on liver and kidney function from long-term exposure to BHA [ 12 ]. Furthermore, clinical studies have found that BHA can promote the development and progress of urticaria and CU [ [13] ,  [14] ,  [15] ].\n\nNetwork toxicology is based on network pharmacology and network biology, which combines bioinformatics and big data analysis with genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics techniques to build a network of relationships between chemicals, toxicities, and targets [ 16 , 17 ]. By employing intuitive graphical models, network toxicology deciphers the complex mechanisms of multi-component and multi-target toxicants, facilitating systematic analysis of interactions among target proteins and prediction of the molecular pathways through which toxicants induce disease. Molecular docking, a widely used virtual screening technology, simulates the recognition and binding process between receptor and ligand by calculating the corresponding parameters to predict the binding affinity and mode. If the structure of the target proteins is known, the binding ability of the compounds can be virtually screened by computer [ 18 ]. Hence, molecular docking could be utilized to predict the binding capacity of the toxicities in traditional Chinese medicine and the relevant receptors, this capability provides robust validation for findings in network toxicology studies. In our work, we employed network toxicology and molecular docking to comprehensively investigate the potential toxicity and mechanism of the widely used BHA.\n\nTherefore, we applied network toxicology and molecular docking to help elucidate the action pathways in BHA-induced CU. This study aimed to identify and analyze the potential toxicity pathways associated with BHA-induced CU, which will help to elucidate the toxicological profile of BHA, predict its potential toxicity and molecular mechanisms, and provide insights into the proper management of this compound. The flowchart of this work is shown in  Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Flowchart of this work. Fig. 1\n\nFlowchart of this work."

Leveraging these tools, we have gained a fundamental but precise understanding of the toxic effects induced by BHA on humans and the environment.\n\nThe structure and SMILE nodes of BHA were identified by searching for ‘butylated hydroxyanisole’ on the PubChem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). Based on the result, potential targets of BHA were retrieved from the ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases [ 21 , 22 ] with the limited species of ‘ Homo sapiens ’. Subsequently, we uploaded the obtained targets of BHA to the Uniport database [ 23 ] for standardization and merging to deduplicate.\n\nWe searched the relevant targets through the CTD, GeneCard, and OMIM databases with the keyword ‘chronic urticaria’ and limited the species to ‘ Homo sapiens ’. The related potential targets were obtained by merging and deduplicating.\n\nBioVenn [ 24 ] was employed to integrate the potential targets common to BHA and CU, considering the intersection as the potential pathogenic targets of BHA-induced CU toxicity. This approach allowed us to explore how BHA interacts with specific targets to induce CU.\n\nNext, we inputted the intersected genes' potential targets of BHA-induced CU into the SPRING database, with the limited species of ‘ Homo sapiens ’ and setting the ‘Minimum required interaction score’ to ‘Medium Confidence >0.4’ and choosing the ‘FDR Stringency Value’ as ‘High’. The above parameters were applied in the analysis.\n\nSubsequently, the results were uploaded to Cytoscape3.7.1 [ 25 ] for visual analysis, where we generated a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network diagram by calculating the parameters and topological properties of each node to the edge. The screening standards of core targets were as follows: nodes simultaneously meeting the following three conditions were selected as core targets of BHA-induced CU: degree, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality > median were set to screen the core targets.\n\nTo explore the biological function of potential targets of BHA-induced CU, the Bioconductor clusterProfiler and org.Hs.eg.db package of R 4.0.2 ( https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/ ) software and DOSE packages [ 26 , 27 ] performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis [ 28 ] and Gene Ontology biofunctional enrichment analysis [ 29 ], including assessment of biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC) and molecular functions (MF) to elucidate the major biological functions of BHA-induced CU. After inputting the data of potential targets into R, we set the threshold as  p  < 0.05 and  q  < 0.05 to ensure the main toxicity pathway of the obtained targets.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted KEGG enrichment analysis on the core targets of BHA-induced CU using R 4.0.2 software further to investigate the pathways of core targets and CU, therefore, helping to elucidate and emphasize important signaling pathways involved in the biological process.\n\nWe employed molecular docking to further clarify the intermolecular intersections between BHA and core target proteins by predicting binding modes and affinity. Crystal structure files for BHA and the core proteins were obtained from the PubChem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) and the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB,  https://www.rcsb.org/ ), respectively. Water molecules were removed from the core proteins using AutoDockTools 1.5.6 software, followed by the addition of nonpolar hydrogens and the calculation of Gasteiger charges.

      "text": "Using online tools, we obtained a comprehensive assessment of the toxicity of BHA toxicity. According to the prediction results, the BHA toxicity endpoint was related to carcinogenicity (prediction: active) in ProTox II and was associated with skin sensitization, eye corrosivity, respiratory toxicity, and environmental toxicity in ADMETlab 2.0. The above findings provide further insight into the relationship between BHA toxicity and the development of CU, highlighting its detrimental effects on human health.\n\nIn this study, we searched the ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases for potential targets of BHA using ‘butylated hydroxyanisole’ as the keyword, and retrieved 281, 7, and 10 targets, respectively. These targets were pooled and de-duplicated to obtain 288 potential targets of BHA. A total of 1582 targets highly relevant to CU were collected using CTD, GeneCards, and OMIM databases. Intersection analysis using a Venny diagram ( Fig. 2 ) revealed 81 potential targets associated with BHA-induced CU (Supplement material  Table S1 ).

The top 20 entries with the lowest FDR values in BP, CC, and MF are presented in  Fig. 4 . In addition, we conducted KEGG enrichment analysis on 81 potential targets using R to identify pathways that are highly relevant to BHA-induced CU.

(A) GO biological process analysis. (B) GO molecular function. (C) GO cellular component. (D) KEGG pathway.\n\nNotably, numerous targets identified through GO and KEGG analyses are involved in key regulatory processes, such as inflammatory responses, intercellular signaling, ions balance in cells, and neuronal transmission. These potential targets are also associated with cell molecular functions, responding to lipopolysaccharides, modulating the activity of associated proteins (e.g., nerve-related receptors and lipases, etc.), and contributing to cell membrane formation.\n\nThe KEGG enrichment analysis revealed potential targets in several pathways, including natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, endocrine resistance, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and cancer-related pathways. Among these, the cancer-related pathways were consistent with the BHA carcinogenicity findings mentioned earlier.\n\nBased on the retrieved 31 core targets of BHA-induced CU, 134 typical signaling pathways were identified from KEGG pathway enrichment, and the top 20 most relevant signaling pathways are shown ( Fig. 5 ). Hence, a ‘core target-pathway’ network diagram was constructed to illustrate the overlap of targets within each pathway. ( Fig. 5 ). The above results suggested that the predominant pathways of the core targets of BHA-induced CU were also closely associated with pathways in cancer, as well as estrogen and endocrine resistance. Surprisingly, there is a significant association between CU and prostate cancer, as well as endocrine resistance, based on potential and core targets and their KEGG enrichment.

(C) Heat map analysis of hub target-pathway.\n\nWe investigated the interaction between BHA and six core targets (TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9) using molecular docking analysis. Employing AutoDock Vina software, we obtained optimal docking results showing low binding energies, indicating a strong affinity between BHA and each target protein. Notably, all six core proteins demonstrated high affinity binding to BHA, with binding energies of −2.8 kcal/mol for TNF (PDB ID:  2zjc ), −4.9 kcal/mol for SRC (PDB ID:  2bdf ), −4.7 kcal/mol for CASP3 (PDB ID:  1re1 ), −4.7 kcal/mol for BCL2 (PDB ID:  7qtw ), −4.4 kcal/mol for IL2 (PDB ID:  7raa ) and −2.1 kcal/mol for MMP9 (PDB ID:  5th6 ). These binding energies were less than 0, suggesting that BHA can spontaneously bind to each core protein via hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, etc., indicating their important roles in the molecular mechanism of BHA-induced CU. As a negative control, we included BHA binding to a random target protein, IL33 (PDB ID:  4kc3 ), which is associated with CU. The binding energy observed was −2.0 kcal/mol. These results affirm that BHA specifically binds to each core target protein, indicating their pivotal involvement in the molecular pathway of BHA-induced CU. Finally, PyMOL 2.3.0 was employed to visualize the lowest binding energy between each protein and BHA ( Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 Visualization of BHA and proteins docking.

Hence, a ‘core target-pathway’ network diagram was constructed to illustrate the overlap of targets within each pathway. ( Fig. 5 ). The above results suggested that the predominant pathways of the core targets of BHA-induced CU were also closely associated with pathways in cancer, as well as estrogen and endocrine resistance. Surprisingly, there is a significant association between CU and prostate cancer, as well as endocrine resistance, based on potential and core targets and their KEGG enrichment.

      "text": "We investigated the interaction between BHA and six core targets (TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9) using molecular docking analysis. Employing AutoDock Vina software, we obtained optimal docking results showing low binding energies, indicating a strong affinity between BHA and each target protein. Notably, all six core proteins demonstrated high affinity binding to BHA, with binding energies of −2.8 kcal/mol for TNF (PDB ID:  2zjc ), −4.9 kcal/mol for SRC (PDB ID:  2bdf ), −4.7 kcal/mol for CASP3 (PDB ID:  1re1 ), −4.7 kcal/mol for BCL2 (PDB ID:  7qtw ), −4.4 kcal/mol for IL2 (PDB ID:  7raa ) and −2.1 kcal/mol for MMP9 (PDB ID:  5th6 ). These binding energies were less than 0, suggesting that BHA can spontaneously bind to each core protein via hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, etc., indicating their important roles in the molecular mechanism of BHA-induced CU. As a negative control, we included BHA binding to a random target protein, IL33 (PDB ID:  4kc3 ), which is associated with CU. The binding energy observed was −2.0 kcal/mol. These results affirm that BHA specifically binds to each core target protein, indicating their pivotal involvement in the molecular pathway of BHA-induced CU. Finally, PyMOL 2.3.0 was employed to visualize the lowest binding energy between each protein and BHA ( Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 Visualization of BHA and proteins docking.

      "text": "Herein, we employed online tools to assess the toxicity of BHA and found that it was associated with carcinogenicity, skin sensitization, and environmental toxicity. Subsequently, we utilized the ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases to predict BHA-related targets, while leveraging the CTD, GeneCards, and OMIM databases to gather targets associated with CU. 81 potential targets of BHA-induced CU were ultimately identified. The protein-protein interaction analysis of potential targets yielded 31 core targets against BHA-induced CU, including TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9.\n\nThe pathogenesis of CU involves histamine, platelet-activating factor (PAF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [ 31 ]. CU onset is linked to the activation of the TNF-α receptor signaling pathway, leading to increased circulating concentrations of TNF-α, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2 in the body [ 32 ]. Research has found that the expressions of TNF-α and IL-3 are upregulated in different types of urticaria lesion skin compared to non-lesion skin [ 33 ]. Furthermore, dysregulation of the TNF-α pathway is implicated in diverse conditions such as sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [ 34 ]. According to KEGG analysis, TNF is also involved in cancer regulation, aligning with findings suggesting that BHA may contribute to cancer initiation.\n\nSarcoma (SRC) and its family of protein kinases play key roles in cell morphology, motility, proliferation, and survival. They facilitate signal transduction for cell survival and mitosis, influence the cytoskeleton, and reorganize adhesion systems that support cell migration and invasion, ultimately affecting the growth of invasion and tumor metastasis [ 35 ].\n\nCaspase 3 (CASP3) encodes a cysteine-aspartate protease that acts on the execution phase of apoptosis. CASP3 cleaves GSDMD-related proteins and induces secondary focal prolapse [ 36 ]. Previous research indicates that CASP3 has non-apoptotic effects, such as increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation and inhibiting their invasion and metastasis [ 37 ].\n\nIn a study involving B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and urticaria, it was shown that elevated BCL2 expression in activated B and T lymphocytes among patients with severe CU compared to those with moderate CU, contact dermatitis, and normal individuals [ 38 ].\n\nAs for interleukin 2  (IL2) , a study has shown that plasma concentrations of IL-2 and sIL-2R are notably higher in patients with various dermatological disorders, including maculopapular eruption, erythema multiforme, drug-induced urticaria, and others (such as maculopapular eruption, erythema multiforme, erythema multiforme with erythema nodosum, drug-induced urticaria, congestive vasculitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis and loosening), compared to controls [ 39 ]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the −330 and + 166 loci of the IL-2 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to chronic spontaneous urticaria, instead of being the same expressed ways [ 40 ]. Interestingly, IL2 can be applied to the treatment of angioneurotic edema, urticaria, as well as urticaria and angioedema in patients with renal cell carcinoma with limited effect [ [41] ,  [42] ,  [43] ].\n\nMatrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), an endopeptidase, has been identified as significantly upregulated and a reliable biomarker in the serum of CU patients, influencing vascular permeability [ 44 ] and accelerating urticaria symptoms. The rising plasma levels of MMP-9 and its inhibitor TIMP-1 in patients with CU suggest that it is a persistent inflammatory process, and the severity and CRP levels correlate with the plasma MMP-9 levels [ 45 ]. Moreover, abnormal MMP9 activation has also been implicated in various neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, brain injury, stroke, neurodegeneration, and brain cancer [ 46 ].\n\nFollowing molecular docking, BHA was found to bind spontaneously to each core protein through hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces after molecular docking of BHA to TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9. Lower binding energies indicate tighter binding between the small molecule and the protein. It was reported that orally administered BHA protected mice from RIPK1 kinase-dependent lethality induced by TNF injection in a model of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, possibly because BHA binds to TNF to reduce the damage [ 47 ]. In addition, prolonged exposure to potassium sorbate, BHA, sodium benzoate, calcium propionate, and boric acid adversely affected liver and kidney function, accompanied by increased mRNA levels of TLR-4, TLR-2, NF-κB, and TNF-α in renal and hepatic tissues [ 12 ].\n\nA recent study has shown that the phenolic antioxidant BHA inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, thereby potentially suppressing TPA- or UV-induced effects through c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase and the MAPK pathway [ 48 ]. BHA has also been observed to increase cystatinase-3 activity and the number of membrane-bound protein-V-positive cells, leading to apoptosis [ 49 ]. BHA-pretreated human HCC cell lines enhanced cellular Bcl-2 expression, decreased Bax expression, and attenuated CASP9 and CASP3 activation, resulting in cytochrome  c  reduction [ 50 ]. Additionally, BHA has shown inhibitory effects on H 2 O 2 -induced cells increased in Bax expression but decreased Bcl-2 [ 51 ]. The expressions of interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor and transferrin receptor were blocked by BHA after analyzing the stimulated T cells [ 52 ]. Molecular docking analysis indicated that BHA binds to MMP9 through van der Waals forces rather than hydrogen bonding.\n\nKEGG enrichment results showed that BHA-induced CU may influence the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, as demonstrated in a study where inhibition of this pathway suppressed allergic reactions in a mouse model of passive cutaneous allergy [ 53 ]. Moreover, there was research revealed that vitamin D has a beneficial effect on urticaria by decreasing VEGF expression in mast cells by downregulating the PI3K/Akt/p38MAPK/HIF-1α signaling axis [ 54 ]. Therefore, we speculated that BHA upregulated the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and led to CU. Furthermore, we observed that BHA possibly acts on cancer-related signaling pathways to trigger urticaria. All cases of CU associated with cancer are spontaneous and the connection could be established through tumor-specific IgE [ 55 ].\n\nMoreover, machine learning offers rapid predictions and cost reductions. Algorithms assisted by computers can efficiently infer gene regulatory networks with significant computational acceleration [ 56 ]. The molecular docking results showed that BHA and the core proteins bind well, but their binding energy was higher. It is crucial to recognize that docking results can be influenced by various factors beyond the selection of protein structure alone. Molecular docking inherently involves complexities related to the accuracy of scoring functions, handling ligand flexibility, and the dynamic nature of protein-ligand interactions within biological systems. Additionally, we have reviewed relevant literature where docking results similarly diverged from expectations, despite using protein structures reported in the latest study [ 16 ]. These studies highlight challenges in accurately predicting binding interactions in complex biological environments."

  "full_text": "The study aimed to comprehensively investigate environmental pollutants’ potential toxicity and underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on chronic urticaria (CU) induced by butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) exposure, further drawing public awareness regarding the potential risks of environmental pollutants, applying ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases to predict the targets of BHA, CTD, GeneCards, and OMIM databases to collect the relevant targets of CU. Ultimately, we identified 81 potential targets of BHA-induced CU and extracted 31 core targets, including TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that these core targets were predominantly involved in cancer signaling, estrogen and endocrine resistance pathways. Furthermore, molecular docking confirmed the ability of BHA to bind with core targets. The onset and development of CU may result from BHA by affecting multiple immune signaling pathways. Our study elucidated the molecular mechanisms of BHA toxicity and its role in CU induction, providing the basis for preventing and treating chronic urticaria associated with environmental BHA exposure.\n\n## Introduction\n\nChronic urticaria (CU) is a chronic inflammatory condition caused by mast cells, characterized by persistent or recurrent wheezing (hives), angioedema (swelling), or both, lasting at least six weeks [ 1 ]. It affects approximately 1 % of the population in the United States and Europe, with a prevalence of 0.23 % in the United States alone. CU is more prevalent among women and typically manifests in individuals over the age of 40 [ 2 , 3 ]. Several factors can trigger CU, and a study has shown that CU is associated with aeroallergens [ 4 ], although mechanisms are limited.\n\nAlong with the rapid development of industrial chemistry, human reliance on industrial chemicals has grown, yet concerns persist over their biosafety and environmental impacts. Plastic additives, such as plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, surfactants, and pigments, are commonly integrated into plastics for superior performance. However, these additives can easily leach into the environment, particularly during processes like plastic crushing [ 5 ]. It is crucial to assess the potential health risks associated with these pollutants using effective methods.\n\nButylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) serves as an additive not only in plastics but also in food preservatives, food packaging, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and rubber products [ 6 ]. It is classified as safe and approved as a preservative in the European Union and the United States but is prohibited in Japan [ 7 ]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has evaluated BHA as a possible human carcinogen, and BHA has also been reported as an environmental endocrine disruptor [ 8 ]. It has been reported that BHA in the aqueous phase could be further converted to 2-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TBQ), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), etc., which have significantly increased eco-toxicity and are toxic to aquatic organisms [ 9 ]. Research has shown that BHA reduces hatchability, calcifies vertebrae, and increases malformations in zebrafish. It may also interfere with the secretion of estrogen and the homeostasis of steroid hormones [ 10 , 11 ]. Adverse effects on liver and kidney function from long-term exposure to BHA [ 12 ]. Furthermore, clinical studies have found that BHA can promote the development and progress of urticaria and CU [ [13] ,  [14] ,  [15] ].\n\nNetwork toxicology is based on network pharmacology and network biology, which combines bioinformatics and big data analysis with genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics techniques to build a network of relationships between chemicals, toxicities, and targets [ 16 , 17 ]. By employing intuitive graphical models, network toxicology deciphers the complex mechanisms of multi-component and multi-target toxicants, facilitating systematic analysis of interactions among target proteins and prediction of the molecular pathways through which toxicants induce disease. Molecular docking, a widely used virtual screening technology, simulates the recognition and binding process between receptor and ligand by calculating the corresponding parameters to predict the binding affinity and mode. If the structure of the target proteins is known, the binding ability of the compounds can be virtually screened by computer [ 18 ]. Hence, molecular docking could be utilized to predict the binding capacity of the toxicities in traditional Chinese medicine and the relevant receptors, this capability provides robust validation for findings in network toxicology studies. In our work, we employed network toxicology and molecular docking to comprehensively investigate the potential toxicity and mechanism of the widely used BHA.\n\nTherefore, we applied network toxicology and molecular docking to help elucidate the action pathways in BHA-induced CU. This study aimed to identify and analyze the potential toxicity pathways associated with BHA-induced CU, which will help to elucidate the toxicological profile of BHA, predict its potential toxicity and molecular mechanisms, and provide insights into the proper management of this compound. The flowchart of this work is shown in  Fig. 1 . Fig. 1 Flowchart of this work. Fig. 1\n\nFlowchart of this work.\n\n## Methods\n\nThe software tools ProTox II [ 19 ] ( https://tox-new.charite.de/protox_II/ ) and ADMETlab 2.0 [ 20 ] ( https://admetmesh.scbdd .com/service/evaluation/cal) are widely utilized in network toxicology to predict toxicity, screen toxic substances, and predict the carcinogenicity and susceptibility of exogenous substances. Leveraging these tools, we have gained a fundamental but precise understanding of the toxic effects induced by BHA on humans and the environment.\n\nThe structure and SMILE nodes of BHA were identified by searching for ‘butylated hydroxyanisole’ on the PubChem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ). Based on the result, potential targets of BHA were retrieved from the ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases [ 21 , 22 ] with the limited species of ‘ Homo sapiens ’. Subsequently, we uploaded the obtained targets of BHA to the Uniport database [ 23 ] for standardization and merging to deduplicate.\n\nWe searched the relevant targets through the CTD, GeneCard, and OMIM databases with the keyword ‘chronic urticaria’ and limited the species to ‘ Homo sapiens ’. The related potential targets were obtained by merging and deduplicating.\n\nBioVenn [ 24 ] was employed to integrate the potential targets common to BHA and CU, considering the intersection as the potential pathogenic targets of BHA-induced CU toxicity. This approach allowed us to explore how BHA interacts with specific targets to induce CU.\n\nNext, we inputted the intersected genes' potential targets of BHA-induced CU into the SPRING database, with the limited species of ‘ Homo sapiens ’ and setting the ‘Minimum required interaction score’ to ‘Medium Confidence >0.4’ and choosing the ‘FDR Stringency Value’ as ‘High’. The above parameters were applied in the analysis.\n\nSubsequently, the results were uploaded to Cytoscape3.7.1 [ 25 ] for visual analysis, where we generated a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network diagram by calculating the parameters and topological properties of each node to the edge. The screening standards of core targets were as follows: nodes simultaneously meeting the following three conditions were selected as core targets of BHA-induced CU: degree, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality > median were set to screen the core targets.\n\nTo explore the biological function of potential targets of BHA-induced CU, the Bioconductor clusterProfiler and org.Hs.eg.db package of R 4.0.2 ( https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/ ) software and DOSE packages [ 26 , 27 ] performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis [ 28 ] and Gene Ontology biofunctional enrichment analysis [ 29 ], including assessment of biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC) and molecular functions (MF) to elucidate the major biological functions of BHA-induced CU. After inputting the data of potential targets into R, we set the threshold as  p  < 0.05 and  q  < 0.05 to ensure the main toxicity pathway of the obtained targets.\n\nFurthermore, we conducted KEGG enrichment analysis on the core targets of BHA-induced CU using R 4.0.2 software further to investigate the pathways of core targets and CU, therefore, helping to elucidate and emphasize important signaling pathways involved in the biological process.\n\nWe employed molecular docking to further clarify the intermolecular intersections between BHA and core target proteins by predicting binding modes and affinity. Crystal structure files for BHA and the core proteins were obtained from the PubChem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) and the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB,  https://www.rcsb.org/ ), respectively. Water molecules were removed from the core proteins using AutoDockTools 1.5.6 software, followed by the addition of nonpolar hydrogens and the calculation of Gasteiger charges. Ligands and receptors were docked in PDBQT format via AutoDock Vina [ 30 ]. Protein-ligand interactions were visually analyzed using PyMOL 2.3.0.\n\n## Prediction of BHA toxicity\n\nThe software tools ProTox II [ 19 ] ( https://tox-new.charite.de/protox_II/ ) and ADMETlab 2.0 [ 20 ] ( https://admetmesh.scbdd .com/service/evaluation/cal) are widely utilized in network toxicology to predict toxicity, screen toxic substances, and predict the carcinogenicity and susceptibility of exogenous substances.

Ligands and receptors were docked in PDBQT format via AutoDock Vina [ 30 ]. Protein-ligand interactions were visually analyzed using PyMOL 2.3.0.\n\n## Results\n\nUsing online tools, we obtained a comprehensive assessment of the toxicity of BHA toxicity. According to the prediction results, the BHA toxicity endpoint was related to carcinogenicity (prediction: active) in ProTox II and was associated with skin sensitization, eye corrosivity, respiratory toxicity, and environmental toxicity in ADMETlab 2.0. The above findings provide further insight into the relationship between BHA toxicity and the development of CU, highlighting its detrimental effects on human health.\n\nIn this study, we searched the ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases for potential targets of BHA using ‘butylated hydroxyanisole’ as the keyword, and retrieved 281, 7, and 10 targets, respectively. These targets were pooled and de-duplicated to obtain 288 potential targets of BHA. A total of 1582 targets highly relevant to CU were collected using CTD, GeneCards, and OMIM databases. Intersection analysis using a Venny diagram ( Fig. 2 ) revealed 81 potential targets associated with BHA-induced CU (Supplement material  Table S1 ). Fig. 2 The overlapped targets between BHA and CU were found by Venny. Fig. 2\n\nThe overlapped targets between BHA and CU were found by Venny.\n\nUsing the findings mentioned above, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in the STRING database with the organism set as ‘ Homo sapiens ’. The network comprised 81 nodes and 597 edges, with an average node degree of 14.7, established using a ‘confidence level’ threshold higher than 0.4 ( Fig. 3 ). The top 10 core targets of degree were based on the results of the degree value sorting, which were SRC, TNF, BCL2, MMP9, CASP3, MAPK3, HSP90AA1, ESR1, IL2, and ERBB2.

Core targets were identified if they met or exceeded the thresholds of degree ≥14.5, betweenness centrality ≥0.003, and closeness centrality ≥0.520. The core gene network was obtained, including 31 nodes and 374 edges ( Table 1  and  Fig. 3 ). From the analysis depicted in  Fig. 3 , TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9 served as core targets for BHA-induced CU. Table 1 Core targets screened from PPI.

As a result, a total of 1336 statistically significant GO entries were generated, including 1190 biological processes (BP), 52 cellular components (CC), and 94 molecular functions (MF). The top 20 entries with the lowest FDR values in BP, CC, and MF are presented in  Fig. 4 . In addition, we conducted KEGG enrichment analysis on 81 potential targets using R to identify pathways that are highly relevant to BHA-induced CU. Among the 134 pathways analyzed in KEGG, the top 20 most relevant signaling pathways are presented ( Fig. 4 ). Fig. 4 Enrichment of potential targets from BHA and CU.

(A) GO biological process analysis. (B) GO molecular function. (C) GO cellular component. (D) KEGG pathway.\n\nNotably, numerous targets identified through GO and KEGG analyses are involved in key regulatory processes, such as inflammatory responses, intercellular signaling, ions balance in cells, and neuronal transmission. These potential targets are also associated with cell molecular functions, responding to lipopolysaccharides, modulating the activity of associated proteins (e.g., nerve-related receptors and lipases, etc.), and contributing to cell membrane formation.\n\nThe KEGG enrichment analysis revealed potential targets in several pathways, including natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, endocrine resistance, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and cancer-related pathways. Among these, the cancer-related pathways were consistent with the BHA carcinogenicity findings mentioned earlier.\n\nBased on the retrieved 31 core targets of BHA-induced CU, 134 typical signaling pathways were identified from KEGG pathway enrichment, and the top 20 most relevant signaling pathways are shown ( Fig. 5 ). Hence, a ‘core target-pathway’ network diagram was constructed to illustrate the overlap of targets within each pathway. ( Fig. 5 ). The above results suggested that the predominant pathways of the core targets of BHA-induced CU were also closely associated with pathways in cancer, as well as estrogen and endocrine resistance. Surprisingly, there is a significant association between CU and prostate cancer, as well as endocrine resistance, based on potential and core targets and their KEGG enrichment.

(C) Heat map analysis of hub target-pathway.\n\nWe investigated the interaction between BHA and six core targets (TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9) using molecular docking analysis. Employing AutoDock Vina software, we obtained optimal docking results showing low binding energies, indicating a strong affinity between BHA and each target protein. Notably, all six core proteins demonstrated high affinity binding to BHA, with binding energies of −2.8 kcal/mol for TNF (PDB ID:  2zjc ), −4.9 kcal/mol for SRC (PDB ID:  2bdf ), −4.7 kcal/mol for CASP3 (PDB ID:  1re1 ), −4.7 kcal/mol for BCL2 (PDB ID:  7qtw ), −4.4 kcal/mol for IL2 (PDB ID:  7raa ) and −2.1 kcal/mol for MMP9 (PDB ID:  5th6 ). These binding energies were less than 0, suggesting that BHA can spontaneously bind to each core protein via hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, etc., indicating their important roles in the molecular mechanism of BHA-induced CU. As a negative control, we included BHA binding to a random target protein, IL33 (PDB ID:  4kc3 ), which is associated with CU. The binding energy observed was −2.0 kcal/mol. These results affirm that BHA specifically binds to each core target protein, indicating their pivotal involvement in the molecular pathway of BHA-induced CU. Finally, PyMOL 2.3.0 was employed to visualize the lowest binding energy between each protein and BHA ( Fig. 6 ). Fig. 6 Visualization of BHA and proteins docking.

According to the prediction results, the BHA toxicity endpoint was related to carcinogenicity (prediction: active) in ProTox II and was associated with skin sensitization, eye corrosivity, respiratory toxicity, and environmental toxicity in ADMETlab 2.0. The above findings provide further insight into the relationship between BHA toxicity and the development of CU, highlighting its detrimental effects on human health.\n\n## Collection of BHA-induced CU targets\n\nIn this study, we searched the ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases for potential targets of BHA using ‘butylated hydroxyanisole’ as the keyword, and retrieved 281, 7, and 10 targets, respectively. These targets were pooled and de-duplicated to obtain 288 potential targets of BHA. A total of 1582 targets highly relevant to CU were collected using CTD, GeneCards, and OMIM databases. Intersection analysis using a Venny diagram ( Fig. 2 ) revealed 81 potential targets associated with BHA-induced CU (Supplement material  Table S1 ). Fig. 2 The overlapped targets between BHA and CU were found by Venny. Fig. 2\n\nThe overlapped targets between BHA and CU were found by Venny.\n\n## Construction of protein interaction network and acquisition of core genes\n\nUsing the findings mentioned above, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in the STRING database with the organism set as ‘ Homo sapiens ’. The network comprised 81 nodes and 597 edges, with an average node degree of 14.7, established using a ‘confidence level’ threshold higher than 0.4 ( Fig. 3 ). The top 10 core targets of degree were based on the results of the degree value sorting, which were SRC, TNF, BCL2, MMP9, CASP3, MAPK3, HSP90AA1, ESR1, IL2, and ERBB2.

Fig. 3\n\nThe screening process of PPI network by Cytoscape (The larger nodes meant higher degree value).\n\nWe further refined the selection of core targets based on three key parameters: ‘degree’, ‘betweenness centrality’, and ‘closeness centrality’. Core targets were identified if they met or exceeded the thresholds of degree ≥14.5, betweenness centrality ≥0.003, and closeness centrality ≥0.520. The core gene network was obtained, including 31 nodes and 374 edges ( Table 1  and  Fig. 3 ). From the analysis depicted in  Fig. 3 , TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9 served as core targets for BHA-induced CU. Table 1 Core targets screened from PPI.

Subsequently, we utilized the ChEMBL, STITCH, and SwissTargetPrediction databases to predict BHA-related targets, while leveraging the CTD, GeneCards, and OMIM databases to gather targets associated with CU. 81 potential targets of BHA-induced CU were ultimately identified. The protein-protein interaction analysis of potential targets yielded 31 core targets against BHA-induced CU, including TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9.\n\nThe pathogenesis of CU involves histamine, platelet-activating factor (PAF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [ 31 ]. CU onset is linked to the activation of the TNF-α receptor signaling pathway, leading to increased circulating concentrations of TNF-α, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2 in the body [ 32 ]. Research has found that the expressions of TNF-α and IL-3 are upregulated in different types of urticaria lesion skin compared to non-lesion skin [ 33 ]. Furthermore, dysregulation of the TNF-α pathway is implicated in diverse conditions such as sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [ 34 ]. According to KEGG analysis, TNF is also involved in cancer regulation, aligning with findings suggesting that BHA may contribute to cancer initiation.\n\nSarcoma (SRC) and its family of protein kinases play key roles in cell morphology, motility, proliferation, and survival. They facilitate signal transduction for cell survival and mitosis, influence the cytoskeleton, and reorganize adhesion systems that support cell migration and invasion, ultimately affecting the growth of invasion and tumor metastasis [ 35 ].\n\nCaspase 3 (CASP3) encodes a cysteine-aspartate protease that acts on the execution phase of apoptosis. CASP3 cleaves GSDMD-related proteins and induces secondary focal prolapse [ 36 ]. Previous research indicates that CASP3 has non-apoptotic effects, such as increasing the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation and inhibiting their invasion and metastasis [ 37 ].\n\nIn a study involving B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and urticaria, it was shown that elevated BCL2 expression in activated B and T lymphocytes among patients with severe CU compared to those with moderate CU, contact dermatitis, and normal individuals [ 38 ].\n\nAs for interleukin 2  (IL2) , a study has shown that plasma concentrations of IL-2 and sIL-2R are notably higher in patients with various dermatological disorders, including maculopapular eruption, erythema multiforme, drug-induced urticaria, and others (such as maculopapular eruption, erythema multiforme, erythema multiforme with erythema nodosum, drug-induced urticaria, congestive vasculitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis and loosening), compared to controls [ 39 ]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the −330 and + 166 loci of the IL-2 gene are associated with increased susceptibility to chronic spontaneous urticaria, instead of being the same expressed ways [ 40 ]. Interestingly, IL2 can be applied to the treatment of angioneurotic edema, urticaria, as well as urticaria and angioedema in patients with renal cell carcinoma with limited effect [ [41] ,  [42] ,  [43] ].\n\nMatrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), an endopeptidase, has been identified as significantly upregulated and a reliable biomarker in the serum of CU patients, influencing vascular permeability [ 44 ] and accelerating urticaria symptoms. The rising plasma levels of MMP-9 and its inhibitor TIMP-1 in patients with CU suggest that it is a persistent inflammatory process, and the severity and CRP levels correlate with the plasma MMP-9 levels [ 45 ]. Moreover, abnormal MMP9 activation has also been implicated in various neurological disorders such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, brain injury, stroke, neurodegeneration, and brain cancer [ 46 ].\n\nFollowing molecular docking, BHA was found to bind spontaneously to each core protein through hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces after molecular docking of BHA to TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9. Lower binding energies indicate tighter binding between the small molecule and the protein. It was reported that orally administered BHA protected mice from RIPK1 kinase-dependent lethality induced by TNF injection in a model of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, possibly because BHA binds to TNF to reduce the damage [ 47 ]. In addition, prolonged exposure to potassium sorbate, BHA, sodium benzoate, calcium propionate, and boric acid adversely affected liver and kidney function, accompanied by increased mRNA levels of TLR-4, TLR-2, NF-κB, and TNF-α in renal and hepatic tissues [ 12 ].\n\nA recent study has shown that the phenolic antioxidant BHA inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, thereby potentially suppressing TPA- or UV-induced effects through c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase and the MAPK pathway [ 48 ]. BHA has also been observed to increase cystatinase-3 activity and the number of membrane-bound protein-V-positive cells, leading to apoptosis [ 49 ]. BHA-pretreated human HCC cell lines enhanced cellular Bcl-2 expression, decreased Bax expression, and attenuated CASP9 and CASP3 activation, resulting in cytochrome  c  reduction [ 50 ]. Additionally, BHA has shown inhibitory effects on H 2 O 2 -induced cells increased in Bax expression but decreased Bcl-2 [ 51 ]. The expressions of interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor and transferrin receptor were blocked by BHA after analyzing the stimulated T cells [ 52 ]. Molecular docking analysis indicated that BHA binds to MMP9 through van der Waals forces rather than hydrogen bonding.\n\nKEGG enrichment results showed that BHA-induced CU may influence the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, as demonstrated in a study where inhibition of this pathway suppressed allergic reactions in a mouse model of passive cutaneous allergy [ 53 ]. Moreover, there was research revealed that vitamin D has a beneficial effect on urticaria by decreasing VEGF expression in mast cells by downregulating the PI3K/Akt/p38MAPK/HIF-1α signaling axis [ 54 ]. Therefore, we speculated that BHA upregulated the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and led to CU. Furthermore, we observed that BHA possibly acts on cancer-related signaling pathways to trigger urticaria. All cases of CU associated with cancer are spontaneous and the connection could be established through tumor-specific IgE [ 55 ].\n\nMoreover, machine learning offers rapid predictions and cost reductions. Algorithms assisted by computers can efficiently infer gene regulatory networks with significant computational acceleration [ 56 ]. The molecular docking results showed that BHA and the core proteins bind well, but their binding energy was higher. It is crucial to recognize that docking results can be influenced by various factors beyond the selection of protein structure alone. Molecular docking inherently involves complexities related to the accuracy of scoring functions, handling ligand flexibility, and the dynamic nature of protein-ligand interactions within biological systems. Additionally, we have reviewed relevant literature where docking results similarly diverged from expectations, despite using protein structures reported in the latest study [ 16 ]. These studies highlight challenges in accurately predicting binding interactions in complex biological environments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we utilized network toxicology and molecular docking to investigate the pathogenesis of BHA-induced CU. We identified 81 potential targets and extracted 31 core targets, such as TNF, SRC, CASP3, BCL2, IL2, and MMP9. The results of molecular docking suggest that BHA may contribute to CU pathogenesis by modulating the core targets, thereby regulating natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, endocrine resistance, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and cancer-related pathways. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying BHA-induced CU and underscores the utility of network toxicology and molecular docking techniques in investigating the toxicity and mechanisms of other environmental pollutants.\n\n## Data availability statement\n\nData will be made available on request.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nZhihao Zeng:  Writing – original draft, Formal analysis.
