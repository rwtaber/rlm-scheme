      "text": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, short\nfor PFAS, are a group\nof over 10,000 synthetic chemicals with a history of over 50 years. 1  PFAS substances are grouped via their carbon\nchain length: perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids with ≥6 carbons\nand perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids containing ≥7 carbons are\nconsidered long-chain PFAS, whereas those with shorter chain lengths\nare considered short-chain PFAS. 2  Their\nspecialties in durability, dielectricity, and water and heat resistance\nmade them favorable in various industrial and household applications; 3  however, concerns regarding the safety and persistence\nof PFAS have emerged over the years. Being termed as forever chemicals,\ntheir nature of great persistence and chemical stability have resulted\nin widespread distribution in the environment and accumulation in\nthe human body. 4\n\nMore than two decades\nago, in 2002, the United Nations Organization\nof Economic and Development (OECD) published the first PFAS hazard\nassessment, raising public awareness of its potential risk to health. 5 , 6  Pathways of human exposure include ingestion of contaminated water\nand food sources, inhalation of indoor air, and contact with affected\nmedia. 7  The impact of PFAS on health has\nalso been evaluated, considering that measurable levels of PFAS in\nblood, tissues, and organs have been detected in populations living\nin contaminated areas. 8  Current studies\nhave indicated their direct association with various diseases, including\ndevelopmental and reproductive toxicity, immune system dysfunction,\ncardiovascular diseases, and cancer. 9 − 11  Thus, PFAS contamination\nhas become not only a growing environmental concern but also an issue\nof significant global public health importance.\n\nIn 2002, the\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued\nregulations toward PFAS manufacture and import, marking the beginning\nof PFAS regulation. 6  To date, many countries\nand organizations have started to regulate the use of PFAS in certain\nproducts and limit their release into the environment. Regulation\nof long-chain PFAS resulted in the rapid phase out of these chemicals\nin the early 2000s and their substitution by shorter carbon chain\nalternatives. 12 , 13  More recently, in February 2023,\nthe European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) unveiled a proposal to prohibit\napproximately 10,000 “forever” fluorinated PFAS chemicals.\nAccording to ECHA, PFAS chemicals are defined as any substances containing\nat least one fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom without\nattachment of either hydrogen, chloride, bromide, or iodine atoms. 14  Although production of PFAS can be rapidly phased\nout by alternation of chemical synthesis strategies, their accumulation\nin soils, ocean, terrestrial food chains, and contaminated groundwater\ncan persist over long time scales. As a result, the development of\nstrategies to accelerate PFAS elimination is of great importance in\nthe treatment of previously accumulated environmental PFAS and relief\nof public concerns.\n\nTo satisfy the urgent needs of efficient\nPFAS remediation, a wide\nrange of concentration strategies has been proposed and developed.\nAt the present time, granular activated carbon (GAC) and ion exchange\n(IEX) resins remain the two dominant and mostly established treatment\nmethods, 13 , 15  with applications of reverse osmosis, advanced\noxidation processes (ACP), membrane filtration, and foam fractionation\nentering the mainstream. 7 , 16  By capitalizing on\na range of interactions between PFAS and the sorbent, PFAS compounds\ncan be efficiently accumulated on the surface of a sorbent to achieve\nsuccessful capture. Various interaction types, encompassing hydrophobic,\nelectrostatic, and fluorophilic, along with their possible combinations,\nplay a role in sorbing PFAS. 13 , 17  In this Perspective,\nwe will introduce a range of types of PFAS sorbents, with a specific\nemphasis on their sorption and interaction mechanisms. We outline\nand assess their distinctive features, strengths, and limitations\nwhile also providing an outlook on forthcoming directions in PFAS\nremediation."

      "text": "Explained as\na noncovalent interaction between water-repellent molecules, the hydrophobic\ninteraction plays a dominant role in facilitating PFAS sorption onto\ncertain sorbent materials, including the well-established GAC and\nnanoporous carbon materials. 18 , 19  First being recognized\nin 1937, 20  the hydrophobic interaction\nposes greater influence in the comparison with van der Waals interaction. 21  The nonpolar carbon–fluorine bonds in\nPFAS tails are naturally hydrophobic and unfavorable in the means\nof interaction with water, resulting in the highly ordered formation\nof water molecules surrounding them. 22 , 23  Positively\nassociated with elevated free energy, this compactly ordered water\narrangement is energetically unfavorable. 22 − 24  To reduce unfavorability,\nas well as decrease the likelihood of contact with water molecules,\nhydrophobic compounds have a higher tendency to associate with each\nother. 25  The same mechanism applies in\nthe situation when PFAS interacts with hydrophobic sorbent materials.\nIn the contact with PFAS-contaminated water, the hydrophobic surface\nof the sorbent material preferentially interacts with the hydrophobic\nPFAS tails, as both of them are averse to water.\n\nBeing one of\nthe most established PFAS sorbents, granular activated carbon has\nbeen found to have commendable performance on long-chain PFAS removal\nsuch as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic\nacid (PFOS). 13 , 26  Its high efficiency as well as\nlow cost made it a favored strategy in industrial applications. 27 , 28  The micropore surface area on GAC was found to be essential in the\nhydrophobic interaction with PFAS, and preference of pore sizes has\nalso been found to be associated with PFAS chain lengths. 29 , 30  Mesopores (0.002–0.05 μm) are found to be favored over\nmicropores (<0.002 μm) in the adsorption of long-chain PFAS\nsuch as PFOS and PFOA, whereas contradictory findings are associated\nwith the adsorption of short-chain PFASs. 26 , 31\n\nCurrenlty, featuring larger overall hydrophobic surface areas,\nnovel strategies including powdered activated carbon (PAC), nanoporous\ncarbon, enhanced biochars, and cellulose are developed pursuing higher\nefficiency and capacity than GAC. 19 , 28 , 30 , 32 − 35  However, the efficiency of activated carbon base strategies is commonly\ncompromised in the presence of other soluble co-contaminants. 36  Sorption of those nonfluorinated impurities\ncan result in the sorbent reaching capacity prior to the capture of\nPFAS. In addition, there is no regeneration strategy available for\nthese carbon-based sorbents, which negates their previous advantages\nin cost-efficiency. 37  Besides, limited\nremoval efficiency may be found in the encounter with less hydrophobic\nand short-chain PFAS, resulting in remaining residues in treated water.\n\nUnlike the above-mentioned\nhydrophobic interaction, the fluorine–fluorine interaction\nappears to be a promising force to provide sorption selectivity especially\nin the presence of large quantity of co-contaminants. Being recognized\nas the most electronegative element in the periodic table, fluorine\nis enabled to polarize nearby atoms, enhancing their ability to interact\nwith other electron-rich substances. It has been reported that the\nfluorine atom has low atomic polarizability and exhibits a reduced\npropensity to interact with other molecules. 38  Consequently, they tend to segregate, minimizing intermolecular\ncontacts with nonfluorous matter while maximizing contacts with fluorinated\ncompounds. Recall that PFAS substances are also synthetic aliphatic\nchemicals in which hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon skeletons are completely\nor partially replaced by fluorine atoms. 26  Such fluorous interaction distinguishes fluorinated sorbents from\nothers and has promoted interests in employing fluorine-containing\nsorbents for selective and specific capture of PFAS.\n\nIn the\ncircumstance of PFAS sorption, fluorinated segments in sorbents can\nprovide specific fluorous interactions with the fluorinated tail of\nPFAS molecules, enhancing the capture of PFAS substances in water\nwhile reducing the sorption of other co-contaminants. In a trial carried\nout by Tan et al., the fluorinated block copolymer synthesized was\nfound to have commendable performance on rapid PFOA sorption, as well\nas minimized impact from soluble co-contaminants. 39  To be more specific, the presence of dissolved proteins\nand other biomolecules, e.g., 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, has no\nadverse impact on the removal of PFOA from the solution.\n\nAlthough\nthe fluorous interaction is inherently stronger than the\nhydrophobic interaction, relying solely on it in sorbents proves inadequate\nfor capturing PFAS at low parts per billion (ppb) concentrations in\naqueous environments. Thus, cooperation with hydrophobic and/or electrostatic\ninteractions is commonly seen in the design of fluorinated sorbents.\nA number of studies carried out in recent years have investigated\nthe practicality of fluorinated compounds in sorbent design for selective\nsorption, making it a promising solution to one of the primary challenges\nin selective PFAS capture which will be introduced in the later section. 39 − 41\n\nThe electrostatic\ninteraction is a noncovalent interaction between charged particles\nand can be either attractive or repulsive depending on types of charges.\nPFAS compounds, containing a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic/fluorophilic\ntail in structure, are normally ionic under aqueous conditions. This\nmakes the use of electrostatic interaction for PFAS sorption a promising\nstrategy. 22  Mechanisms behind the scenes\ninclude well-established electrostatic attraction and ion exchange,\nwhereas the existence of Coulombic repulsion is found to hinder sorption. 35 , 42 , 43\n\nTaking IEX resin as an\nexample, it is able to attract molecules with opposite charge onto\nits large surface area and release an equal number of same charged\nions to the solution until formation of equilibrium. 44  The ion exchange sites can be either cationic or anionic\ndepending on the charge of fixed functional groups attached to its\nmatrix. The anion exchange resins are favored and better developed\nas the majority of currently established PFAS compounds are found\nto be anionic. 45  The ionic characteristics\nof IEX are commonly gained in the production process by methylation\nor quaternization. 13 , 46 − 50  Both iodomethane and chloromethane are considered\nforms of methylation, depending on the designed resin structure and\ncan result in the transfer of a cation methyl group to the resin matrix;\nwhile quaternization, on the other hand, adds a quaternary ammonium\ngroup composed of charged nitrogen atoms. Being one of the most established\nPFAS sorbents, the viability of IEX has been investigated in multiple\ntrials in recent decades, with merits reported in versatility, regenerability,\nefficiency, and capacity.\n\nHowever, restricted performance of\nIEX resins have been found in\ntrials with involvement of other soluble ionic impurities, resulting\nin sorption competition. 51  Current PFAS\nremoval technologies featuring electrostatic interaction typically\nremove waterborne contaminants nonspecifically, resulting in saturation\nby nonfluorinated species. 52  The competition\nsorption of other co-contaminants can clog ion-exchange sorbents,\nthus significantly impacting their PFAS sorption capacity and reducing\ntheir lifespan. 53  This makes the applications\nof these sorbents cost prohibitive.\n\nThe\ncooperation between hydrophobic, fluorous, and electrostatic segments\nin the sorbent design maximizes the sorption capacity, selectivity,\nand kinetics in the removal of PFAS, including the challenging short-chain\nPFAS. For instance, the porous polymers with quaternary ammonium segments\nare a good representation of combining hydrophobic and electrostatic\ninteractions. Liu et al. reported in their trial that electrostatically\nmodified porous aromatic framework (PAF) scored 14.8 times better\nperformance in PFOA adsorption than nonquaternized parent material,\nand 24.1 times higher than activated carbons accordingly. 54  Optimal performance on PFOS adsorption was also\nwitnessed in a modified cationic porous chitosan bead biosorbent. 55  The metal–organic frameworks, a novel\nfield of coordination polymers, can be another example of where hydrophobic\nand electrostatic interactions collaborate with each other. 56  A positive correlation was found between value\nof specific surface area (SSA) and sorption capacity, whereas cationic\ncharacteristics was found to augment capacity even in conditions with\ndecreased SSA. 57  In another study regarding\nthe sorption of both short-chain and long-chain PFAS, extraordinary\nremoval efficiency was found using cationic porous β-cyclodextrin\npolymer (cyclic oligosaccharides containing seven  d -glucose\nunits) even at low resin concentrations at 1 mg L –1  ( Figure  1 a). 58  The PFOA concentration was reduced from 1 μg\nL –1  to less than 10 ng L –1  using\nβ-cyclodextrin, which is approximately 7 times lower than the\nregulatory requirements of the U.S. EPA. 58 , 59  As found in those studies, combination of electrostatic interaction\nwith hydrophobicity can elevate resin adsorption performance, while\nlack of selectivity remains unsolved in this combination strategy.\n\nSummarization\nof chemical structures of interplay PFAS sorbents.\n(a) Porous β-cyclodextrin polymers [adapted from refs ( 58 ,  60 ,  61 ).

Copyright 2020, American\nChemical Society], and (d) fluorophilic amine-functionalized redox-active\ncopolymers.\n\nRecent achievements seek combinations\nof fluorous, electrostatic,\nand/or hydrophobic interactions to overcome the above challenges and\nenable efficient capture of PFAS under a real contaminated environment,\nincluding short-chain PFAS. A recent study in our group reported the\ninnovation of a new magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbent ( Figure  1 b), featuring incorporation\nof fluorous (perfluoropolyether) and electrostatic (quaternary ammonium)\ninteractions. Such a sorbent was found to have improved performance\non the removal of both short-chain and long-chain PFAS, reaching >99%\nremoval efficiency within 30 s, even in the presence of co-contaminants. 46  Notably, the removal of an emerging ammonium\nsalt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) reaches a high\nsorption capacity of 219 mg g –1  based on the Langmuir\nmodel. The superior performance is also evidenced by the ease of multiple\nregenerations by washing with a methanol salt solution. In addition\nto the previously mentioned porous β-cyclodextrins based on\nhydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, fluorinated β-cyclodextrins\nhave also been employed in PFAS adsorption, incorporating fluorous\ninteractions ( Figure  1 a). Examples include decafluorobiphenyl β-cyclodextrins (DFB-CDP)\nand pentafluorobenzaldehyde amine β-cyclodextrins. Both modifications\nhave demonstrated exceptional performance in PFAS removal. DFB-CDP,\nfor instance, was reported to be ten times more effective than GAC,\nwhile amine β-cyclodextrins exhibited the highest affinity for\nPFAS and GenX among the designed CD-based adsorbents. 60 , 61  In addition, an ionic fluorogel (IF) ( Figure  1 c) is another form of design that creditably\nillustrates the combination of electrostatic and fluorophilic interactions.\nIn trials carried out by Kumarsamy et al., a commercially available\nperfluoropolyether was copolymerized with an amine monomer, ionized,\nand sieved for assessments of PFAS removal. 50  Their study indicates significantly higher affinity and capacity\nfor both long- and short-chain PFAS removals in batch studies. In\nreal water trials, water sourced from PFAS contaminated sites with\n1.3 mg/L total organic content (TOC) were tested, with liquid chromatography–mass\nspectrometry (LC-MS) results indicating nondetectable long-chain PFAS\nconcentration and over 95% removal efficiency of shorter chain PFAS\nincluding perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), GenX, and perfluorohexanoic\nacid (PFHxA). The flexibility and diversity in monomer selection have\nalso made the improvement in IF structure and design easier to be\nachieved. In another trial carried out in 2022, hydrolytically stable\nIF sorbents were reported to be effective sorbents for removing 21\nlegacy and emerging PFAS from natural water, and they demonstrated\nregenerability across multiple reuse cycles. 62  The fluorophilic amine-functionalized redox-active polymer reported\nby Román Santiago et al. ( Figurer  1 d) has also demonstrated the role of fluorous\ninteraction in facilitating binding of shorter chain PFAS, particularly\nthose with lower hydrophobicity. 63  A 2%\nfluorination was also found to be the percentage demonstrating optimal\ncooperation between electrostatic and fluorous interactions.\n\nThe role of each type of interaction plays was assessed in our\nprevious reports, of which the relative contributions of fluorous\nand electrostatic interactions were assessed using 1D and 2D  19 F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and isothermal titration\ncalorimetry (ITC). 17  A fast exchange between\nbonded and free PFOA was observed in the sorbent material featuring\nthe fluorine–fluorine interaction, whereas electrostatic interaction\nwas associated with tight binding without such exchange. Evidence\nalso shows that fluorous interaction exhibits greater strength and\nefficiency at higher PFAS concentrations, whereas electrostatic interaction\nplays dominantly in low PFAS concentrations. 17  In a research trial conducted by Román Santiago et al., various\ncopolymers incorporating redox-active, electrostatic, and fluorophilic\ninteractions were evaluated against perfluoroalkyl acids ranging from\nchain lengths four to seven. 63  The copolymers,\nespecially those with introduced fluorinated segments, exhibited notably\nimproved capture efficiency for shorter-chain PFAS. This suggests\na pivotal role of the fluorine–fluorine interaction in capturing\nmore hydrophilic PFAS compounds, particularly those with shorter chain\nlengths. Additionally, their adsorption and desorption studies highlighted\ndiffering mechanisms of PFAS adsorption in the presence of long-chain\nPFHxS and short-chain PFBA, underscoring the effectiveness of employing\nvarious interactions in designing advanced PFAS sorbents."

Evidence\nalso shows that fluorous interaction exhibits greater strength and\nefficiency at higher PFAS concentrations, whereas electrostatic interaction\nplays dominantly in low PFAS concentrations. 17  In a research trial conducted by Román Santiago et al., various\ncopolymers incorporating redox-active, electrostatic, and fluorophilic\ninteractions were evaluated against perfluoroalkyl acids ranging from\nchain lengths four to seven. 63  The copolymers,\nespecially those with introduced fluorinated segments, exhibited notably\nimproved capture efficiency for shorter-chain PFAS. This suggests\na pivotal role of the fluorine–fluorine interaction in capturing\nmore hydrophilic PFAS compounds, particularly those with shorter chain\nlengths. Additionally, their adsorption and desorption studies highlighted\ndiffering mechanisms of PFAS adsorption in the presence of long-chain\nPFHxS and short-chain PFBA, underscoring the effectiveness of employing\nvarious interactions in designing advanced PFAS sorbents."

  "full_text": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl\nsubstances (PFAS) are a group of synthetic\nchemicals characterized with persistence and multisurface resistance.\nTheir accumulation in the environment and toxicity to human beings\nhave contributed to the rapid development of regulations worldwide\nsince 2002. The sorption strategy, taking advantage of intermolecular\ninteractions for PFAS capture, provides a promising and efficient\nsolution to the treatment of PFAS contaminated sources. Hydrophobic\nand electrostatic interactions are the two commonly found in commercially\navailable PFAS sorbents, with the fluorous interaction being the novel\nmechanism applied for sorbent selectivity. The main object of this\nPerspective is to provide a critical review on the current design\ncriteria of PFAS sorbents, with particular focus on their sorption\nand interaction mechanisms as well as limitations. An outlook on future\ninnovative design for efficient PFAS sorbents is also provided.\n\n## Introduction\n\nPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, short\nfor PFAS, are a group\nof over 10,000 synthetic chemicals with a history of over 50 years. 1  PFAS substances are grouped via their carbon\nchain length: perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids with ≥6 carbons\nand perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids containing ≥7 carbons are\nconsidered long-chain PFAS, whereas those with shorter chain lengths\nare considered short-chain PFAS. 2  Their\nspecialties in durability, dielectricity, and water and heat resistance\nmade them favorable in various industrial and household applications; 3  however, concerns regarding the safety and persistence\nof PFAS have emerged over the years. Being termed as forever chemicals,\ntheir nature of great persistence and chemical stability have resulted\nin widespread distribution in the environment and accumulation in\nthe human body. 4\n\nMore than two decades\nago, in 2002, the United Nations Organization\nof Economic and Development (OECD) published the first PFAS hazard\nassessment, raising public awareness of its potential risk to health. 5 , 6  Pathways of human exposure include ingestion of contaminated water\nand food sources, inhalation of indoor air, and contact with affected\nmedia. 7  The impact of PFAS on health has\nalso been evaluated, considering that measurable levels of PFAS in\nblood, tissues, and organs have been detected in populations living\nin contaminated areas. 8  Current studies\nhave indicated their direct association with various diseases, including\ndevelopmental and reproductive toxicity, immune system dysfunction,\ncardiovascular diseases, and cancer. 9 − 11  Thus, PFAS contamination\nhas become not only a growing environmental concern but also an issue\nof significant global public health importance.\n\nIn 2002, the\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued\nregulations toward PFAS manufacture and import, marking the beginning\nof PFAS regulation. 6  To date, many countries\nand organizations have started to regulate the use of PFAS in certain\nproducts and limit their release into the environment. Regulation\nof long-chain PFAS resulted in the rapid phase out of these chemicals\nin the early 2000s and their substitution by shorter carbon chain\nalternatives. 12 , 13  More recently, in February 2023,\nthe European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) unveiled a proposal to prohibit\napproximately 10,000 “forever” fluorinated PFAS chemicals.\nAccording to ECHA, PFAS chemicals are defined as any substances containing\nat least one fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom without\nattachment of either hydrogen, chloride, bromide, or iodine atoms. 14  Although production of PFAS can be rapidly phased\nout by alternation of chemical synthesis strategies, their accumulation\nin soils, ocean, terrestrial food chains, and contaminated groundwater\ncan persist over long time scales. As a result, the development of\nstrategies to accelerate PFAS elimination is of great importance in\nthe treatment of previously accumulated environmental PFAS and relief\nof public concerns.\n\nTo satisfy the urgent needs of efficient\nPFAS remediation, a wide\nrange of concentration strategies has been proposed and developed.\nAt the present time, granular activated carbon (GAC) and ion exchange\n(IEX) resins remain the two dominant and mostly established treatment\nmethods, 13 , 15  with applications of reverse osmosis, advanced\noxidation processes (ACP), membrane filtration, and foam fractionation\nentering the mainstream. 7 , 16  By capitalizing on\na range of interactions between PFAS and the sorbent, PFAS compounds\ncan be efficiently accumulated on the surface of a sorbent to achieve\nsuccessful capture. Various interaction types, encompassing hydrophobic,\nelectrostatic, and fluorophilic, along with their possible combinations,\nplay a role in sorbing PFAS. 13 , 17  In this Perspective,\nwe will introduce a range of types of PFAS sorbents, with a specific\nemphasis on their sorption and interaction mechanisms. We outline\nand assess their distinctive features, strengths, and limitations\nwhile also providing an outlook on forthcoming directions in PFAS\nremediation.\n\n## Interaction Mechanisms with PFAS\n\nExplained as\na noncovalent interaction between water-repellent molecules, the hydrophobic\ninteraction plays a dominant role in facilitating PFAS sorption onto\ncertain sorbent materials, including the well-established GAC and\nnanoporous carbon materials. 18 , 19  First being recognized\nin 1937, 20  the hydrophobic interaction\nposes greater influence in the comparison with van der Waals interaction. 21  The nonpolar carbon–fluorine bonds in\nPFAS tails are naturally hydrophobic and unfavorable in the means\nof interaction with water, resulting in the highly ordered formation\nof water molecules surrounding them. 22 , 23  Positively\nassociated with elevated free energy, this compactly ordered water\narrangement is energetically unfavorable. 22 − 24  To reduce unfavorability,\nas well as decrease the likelihood of contact with water molecules,\nhydrophobic compounds have a higher tendency to associate with each\nother. 25  The same mechanism applies in\nthe situation when PFAS interacts with hydrophobic sorbent materials.\nIn the contact with PFAS-contaminated water, the hydrophobic surface\nof the sorbent material preferentially interacts with the hydrophobic\nPFAS tails, as both of them are averse to water.\n\nBeing one of\nthe most established PFAS sorbents, granular activated carbon has\nbeen found to have commendable performance on long-chain PFAS removal\nsuch as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic\nacid (PFOS). 13 , 26  Its high efficiency as well as\nlow cost made it a favored strategy in industrial applications. 27 , 28  The micropore surface area on GAC was found to be essential in the\nhydrophobic interaction with PFAS, and preference of pore sizes has\nalso been found to be associated with PFAS chain lengths. 29 , 30  Mesopores (0.002–0.05 μm) are found to be favored over\nmicropores (<0.002 μm) in the adsorption of long-chain PFAS\nsuch as PFOS and PFOA, whereas contradictory findings are associated\nwith the adsorption of short-chain PFASs. 26 , 31\n\nCurrenlty, featuring larger overall hydrophobic surface areas,\nnovel strategies including powdered activated carbon (PAC), nanoporous\ncarbon, enhanced biochars, and cellulose are developed pursuing higher\nefficiency and capacity than GAC. 19 , 28 , 30 , 32 − 35  However, the efficiency of activated carbon base strategies is commonly\ncompromised in the presence of other soluble co-contaminants. 36  Sorption of those nonfluorinated impurities\ncan result in the sorbent reaching capacity prior to the capture of\nPFAS. In addition, there is no regeneration strategy available for\nthese carbon-based sorbents, which negates their previous advantages\nin cost-efficiency. 37  Besides, limited\nremoval efficiency may be found in the encounter with less hydrophobic\nand short-chain PFAS, resulting in remaining residues in treated water.\n\nUnlike the above-mentioned\nhydrophobic interaction, the fluorine–fluorine interaction\nappears to be a promising force to provide sorption selectivity especially\nin the presence of large quantity of co-contaminants. Being recognized\nas the most electronegative element in the periodic table, fluorine\nis enabled to polarize nearby atoms, enhancing their ability to interact\nwith other electron-rich substances. It has been reported that the\nfluorine atom has low atomic polarizability and exhibits a reduced\npropensity to interact with other molecules. 38  Consequently, they tend to segregate, minimizing intermolecular\ncontacts with nonfluorous matter while maximizing contacts with fluorinated\ncompounds. Recall that PFAS substances are also synthetic aliphatic\nchemicals in which hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon skeletons are completely\nor partially replaced by fluorine atoms. 26  Such fluorous interaction distinguishes fluorinated sorbents from\nothers and has promoted interests in employing fluorine-containing\nsorbents for selective and specific capture of PFAS.\n\nIn the\ncircumstance of PFAS sorption, fluorinated segments in sorbents can\nprovide specific fluorous interactions with the fluorinated tail of\nPFAS molecules, enhancing the capture of PFAS substances in water\nwhile reducing the sorption of other co-contaminants. In a trial carried\nout by Tan et al., the fluorinated block copolymer synthesized was\nfound to have commendable performance on rapid PFOA sorption, as well\nas minimized impact from soluble co-contaminants. 39  To be more specific, the presence of dissolved proteins\nand other biomolecules, e.g., 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, has no\nadverse impact on the removal of PFOA from the solution.\n\nAlthough\nthe fluorous interaction is inherently stronger than the\nhydrophobic interaction, relying solely on it in sorbents proves inadequate\nfor capturing PFAS at low parts per billion (ppb) concentrations in\naqueous environments. Thus, cooperation with hydrophobic and/or electrostatic\ninteractions is commonly seen in the design of fluorinated sorbents.\nA number of studies carried out in recent years have investigated\nthe practicality of fluorinated compounds in sorbent design for selective\nsorption, making it a promising solution to one of the primary challenges\nin selective PFAS capture which will be introduced in the later section. 39 − 41\n\nThe electrostatic\ninteraction is a noncovalent interaction between charged particles\nand can be either attractive or repulsive depending on types of charges.\nPFAS compounds, containing a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic/fluorophilic\ntail in structure, are normally ionic under aqueous conditions. This\nmakes the use of electrostatic interaction for PFAS sorption a promising\nstrategy. 22  Mechanisms behind the scenes\ninclude well-established electrostatic attraction and ion exchange,\nwhereas the existence of Coulombic repulsion is found to hinder sorption. 35 , 42 , 43\n\nTaking IEX resin as an\nexample, it is able to attract molecules with opposite charge onto\nits large surface area and release an equal number of same charged\nions to the solution until formation of equilibrium. 44  The ion exchange sites can be either cationic or anionic\ndepending on the charge of fixed functional groups attached to its\nmatrix. The anion exchange resins are favored and better developed\nas the majority of currently established PFAS compounds are found\nto be anionic. 45  The ionic characteristics\nof IEX are commonly gained in the production process by methylation\nor quaternization. 13 , 46 − 50  Both iodomethane and chloromethane are considered\nforms of methylation, depending on the designed resin structure and\ncan result in the transfer of a cation methyl group to the resin matrix;\nwhile quaternization, on the other hand, adds a quaternary ammonium\ngroup composed of charged nitrogen atoms. Being one of the most established\nPFAS sorbents, the viability of IEX has been investigated in multiple\ntrials in recent decades, with merits reported in versatility, regenerability,\nefficiency, and capacity.\n\nHowever, restricted performance of\nIEX resins have been found in\ntrials with involvement of other soluble ionic impurities, resulting\nin sorption competition. 51  Current PFAS\nremoval technologies featuring electrostatic interaction typically\nremove waterborne contaminants nonspecifically, resulting in saturation\nby nonfluorinated species. 52  The competition\nsorption of other co-contaminants can clog ion-exchange sorbents,\nthus significantly impacting their PFAS sorption capacity and reducing\ntheir lifespan. 53  This makes the applications\nof these sorbents cost prohibitive.\n\nThe\ncooperation between hydrophobic, fluorous, and electrostatic segments\nin the sorbent design maximizes the sorption capacity, selectivity,\nand kinetics in the removal of PFAS, including the challenging short-chain\nPFAS. For instance, the porous polymers with quaternary ammonium segments\nare a good representation of combining hydrophobic and electrostatic\ninteractions. Liu et al. reported in their trial that electrostatically\nmodified porous aromatic framework (PAF) scored 14.8 times better\nperformance in PFOA adsorption than nonquaternized parent material,\nand 24.1 times higher than activated carbons accordingly. 54  Optimal performance on PFOS adsorption was also\nwitnessed in a modified cationic porous chitosan bead biosorbent. 55  The metal–organic frameworks, a novel\nfield of coordination polymers, can be another example of where hydrophobic\nand electrostatic interactions collaborate with each other. 56  A positive correlation was found between value\nof specific surface area (SSA) and sorption capacity, whereas cationic\ncharacteristics was found to augment capacity even in conditions with\ndecreased SSA. 57  In another study regarding\nthe sorption of both short-chain and long-chain PFAS, extraordinary\nremoval efficiency was found using cationic porous β-cyclodextrin\npolymer (cyclic oligosaccharides containing seven  d -glucose\nunits) even at low resin concentrations at 1 mg L –1  ( Figure  1 a). 58  The PFOA concentration was reduced from 1 μg\nL –1  to less than 10 ng L –1  using\nβ-cyclodextrin, which is approximately 7 times lower than the\nregulatory requirements of the U.S. EPA. 58 , 59  As found in those studies, combination of electrostatic interaction\nwith hydrophobicity can elevate resin adsorption performance, while\nlack of selectivity remains unsolved in this combination strategy.\n\nSummarization\nof chemical structures of interplay PFAS sorbents.\n(a) Porous β-cyclodextrin polymers [adapted from refs ( 58 ,  60 ,  61 ). Copyright\n2022, 2017, and 2020, respectively, American Chemical Society], (b)\nmagnetic fluorinated polymer, (c) ionic fluorogels [adapted from ref ( 50 ). Copyright 2020, American\nChemical Society], and (d) fluorophilic amine-functionalized redox-active\ncopolymers.\n\nRecent achievements seek combinations\nof fluorous, electrostatic,\nand/or hydrophobic interactions to overcome the above challenges and\nenable efficient capture of PFAS under a real contaminated environment,\nincluding short-chain PFAS. A recent study in our group reported the\ninnovation of a new magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbent ( Figure  1 b), featuring incorporation\nof fluorous (perfluoropolyether) and electrostatic (quaternary ammonium)\ninteractions. Such a sorbent was found to have improved performance\non the removal of both short-chain and long-chain PFAS, reaching >99%\nremoval efficiency within 30 s, even in the presence of co-contaminants. 46  Notably, the removal of an emerging ammonium\nsalt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) reaches a high\nsorption capacity of 219 mg g –1  based on the Langmuir\nmodel. The superior performance is also evidenced by the ease of multiple\nregenerations by washing with a methanol salt solution. In addition\nto the previously mentioned porous β-cyclodextrins based on\nhydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, fluorinated β-cyclodextrins\nhave also been employed in PFAS adsorption, incorporating fluorous\ninteractions ( Figure  1 a). Examples include decafluorobiphenyl β-cyclodextrins (DFB-CDP)\nand pentafluorobenzaldehyde amine β-cyclodextrins. Both modifications\nhave demonstrated exceptional performance in PFAS removal. DFB-CDP,\nfor instance, was reported to be ten times more effective than GAC,\nwhile amine β-cyclodextrins exhibited the highest affinity for\nPFAS and GenX among the designed CD-based adsorbents. 60 , 61  In addition, an ionic fluorogel (IF) ( Figure  1 c) is another form of design that creditably\nillustrates the combination of electrostatic and fluorophilic interactions.\nIn trials carried out by Kumarsamy et al., a commercially available\nperfluoropolyether was copolymerized with an amine monomer, ionized,\nand sieved for assessments of PFAS removal. 50  Their study indicates significantly higher affinity and capacity\nfor both long- and short-chain PFAS removals in batch studies. In\nreal water trials, water sourced from PFAS contaminated sites with\n1.3 mg/L total organic content (TOC) were tested, with liquid chromatography–mass\nspectrometry (LC-MS) results indicating nondetectable long-chain PFAS\nconcentration and over 95% removal efficiency of shorter chain PFAS\nincluding perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), GenX, and perfluorohexanoic\nacid (PFHxA). The flexibility and diversity in monomer selection have\nalso made the improvement in IF structure and design easier to be\nachieved. In another trial carried out in 2022, hydrolytically stable\nIF sorbents were reported to be effective sorbents for removing 21\nlegacy and emerging PFAS from natural water, and they demonstrated\nregenerability across multiple reuse cycles. 62  The fluorophilic amine-functionalized redox-active polymer reported\nby Román Santiago et al. ( Figurer  1 d) has also demonstrated the role of fluorous\ninteraction in facilitating binding of shorter chain PFAS, particularly\nthose with lower hydrophobicity. 63  A 2%\nfluorination was also found to be the percentage demonstrating optimal\ncooperation between electrostatic and fluorous interactions.\n\nThe role of each type of interaction plays was assessed in our\nprevious reports, of which the relative contributions of fluorous\nand electrostatic interactions were assessed using 1D and 2D  19 F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and isothermal titration\ncalorimetry (ITC). 17  A fast exchange between\nbonded and free PFOA was observed in the sorbent material featuring\nthe fluorine–fluorine interaction, whereas electrostatic interaction\nwas associated with tight binding without such exchange. Evidence\nalso shows that fluorous interaction exhibits greater strength and\nefficiency at higher PFAS concentrations, whereas electrostatic interaction\nplays dominantly in low PFAS concentrations. 17  In a research trial conducted by Román Santiago et al., various\ncopolymers incorporating redox-active, electrostatic, and fluorophilic\ninteractions were evaluated against perfluoroalkyl acids ranging from\nchain lengths four to seven. 63  The copolymers,\nespecially those with introduced fluorinated segments, exhibited notably\nimproved capture efficiency for shorter-chain PFAS. This suggests\na pivotal role of the fluorine–fluorine interaction in capturing\nmore hydrophilic PFAS compounds, particularly those with shorter chain\nlengths. Additionally, their adsorption and desorption studies highlighted\ndiffering mechanisms of PFAS adsorption in the presence of long-chain\nPFHxS and short-chain PFBA, underscoring the effectiveness of employing\nvarious interactions in designing advanced PFAS sorbents.\n\n## Hydrophobic\nInteraction with PFAS Tails\n\nExplained as\na noncovalent interaction between water-repellent molecules, the hydrophobic\ninteraction plays a dominant role in facilitating PFAS sorption onto\ncertain sorbent materials, including the well-established GAC and\nnanoporous carbon materials. 18 , 19  First being recognized\nin 1937, 20  the hydrophobic interaction\nposes greater influence in the comparison with van der Waals interaction. 21  The nonpolar carbon–fluorine bonds in\nPFAS tails are naturally hydrophobic and unfavorable in the means\nof interaction with water, resulting in the highly ordered formation\nof water molecules surrounding them. 22 , 23  Positively\nassociated with elevated free energy, this compactly ordered water\narrangement is energetically unfavorable. 22 − 24  To reduce unfavorability,\nas well as decrease the likelihood of contact with water molecules,\nhydrophobic compounds have a higher tendency to associate with each\nother. 25  The same mechanism applies in\nthe situation when PFAS interacts with hydrophobic sorbent materials.\nIn the contact with PFAS-contaminated water, the hydrophobic surface\nof the sorbent material preferentially interacts with the hydrophobic\nPFAS tails, as both of them are averse to water.\n\nBeing one of\nthe most established PFAS sorbents, granular activated carbon has\nbeen found to have commendable performance on long-chain PFAS removal\nsuch as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic\nacid (PFOS). 13 , 26  Its high efficiency as well as\nlow cost made it a favored strategy in industrial applications. 27 , 28  The micropore surface area on GAC was found to be essential in the\nhydrophobic interaction with PFAS, and preference of pore sizes has\nalso been found to be associated with PFAS chain lengths. 29 , 30  Mesopores (0.002–0.05 μm) are found to be favored over\nmicropores (<0.002 μm) in the adsorption of long-chain PFAS\nsuch as PFOS and PFOA, whereas contradictory findings are associated\nwith the adsorption of short-chain PFASs. 26 , 31\n\nCurrenlty, featuring larger overall hydrophobic surface areas,\nnovel strategies including powdered activated carbon (PAC), nanoporous\ncarbon, enhanced biochars, and cellulose are developed pursuing higher\nefficiency and capacity than GAC. 19 , 28 , 30 , 32 − 35  However, the efficiency of activated carbon base strategies is commonly\ncompromised in the presence of other soluble co-contaminants. 36  Sorption of those nonfluorinated impurities\ncan result in the sorbent reaching capacity prior to the capture of\nPFAS. In addition, there is no regeneration strategy available for\nthese carbon-based sorbents, which negates their previous advantages\nin cost-efficiency. 37  Besides, limited\nremoval efficiency may be found in the encounter with less hydrophobic\nand short-chain PFAS, resulting in remaining residues in treated water.\n\n## Fluorous Interaction with PFAS Tails\n\nUnlike the above-mentioned\nhydrophobic interaction, the fluorine–fluorine interaction\nappears to be a promising force to provide sorption selectivity especially\nin the presence of large quantity of co-contaminants. Being recognized\nas the most electronegative element in the periodic table, fluorine\nis enabled to polarize nearby atoms, enhancing their ability to interact\nwith other electron-rich substances. It has been reported that the\nfluorine atom has low atomic polarizability and exhibits a reduced\npropensity to interact with other molecules. 38  Consequently, they tend to segregate, minimizing intermolecular\ncontacts with nonfluorous matter while maximizing contacts with fluorinated\ncompounds. Recall that PFAS substances are also synthetic aliphatic\nchemicals in which hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon skeletons are completely\nor partially replaced by fluorine atoms. 26  Such fluorous interaction distinguishes fluorinated sorbents from\nothers and has promoted interests in employing fluorine-containing\nsorbents for selective and specific capture of PFAS.\n\nIn the\ncircumstance of PFAS sorption, fluorinated segments in sorbents can\nprovide specific fluorous interactions with the fluorinated tail of\nPFAS molecules, enhancing the capture of PFAS substances in water\nwhile reducing the sorption of other co-contaminants. In a trial carried\nout by Tan et al., the fluorinated block copolymer synthesized was\nfound to have commendable performance on rapid PFOA sorption, as well\nas minimized impact from soluble co-contaminants. 39  To be more specific, the presence of dissolved proteins\nand other biomolecules, e.g., 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, has no\nadverse impact on the removal of PFOA from the solution.\n\nAlthough\nthe fluorous interaction is inherently stronger than the\nhydrophobic interaction, relying solely on it in sorbents proves inadequate\nfor capturing PFAS at low parts per billion (ppb) concentrations in\naqueous environments. Thus, cooperation with hydrophobic and/or electrostatic\ninteractions is commonly seen in the design of fluorinated sorbents.\nA number of studies carried out in recent years have investigated\nthe practicality of fluorinated compounds in sorbent design for selective\nsorption, making it a promising solution to one of the primary challenges\nin selective PFAS capture which will be introduced in the later section. 39 − 41\n\n## Electrostatic Interaction with PFAS Heads\n\nThe electrostatic\ninteraction is a noncovalent interaction between charged particles\nand can be either attractive or repulsive depending on types of charges.\nPFAS compounds, containing a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic/fluorophilic\ntail in structure, are normally ionic under aqueous conditions. This\nmakes the use of electrostatic interaction for PFAS sorption a promising\nstrategy. 22  Mechanisms behind the scenes\ninclude well-established electrostatic attraction and ion exchange,\nwhereas the existence of Coulombic repulsion is found to hinder sorption. 35 , 42 , 43\n\nTaking IEX resin as an\nexample, it is able to attract molecules with opposite charge onto\nits large surface area and release an equal number of same charged\nions to the solution until formation of equilibrium. 44  The ion exchange sites can be either cationic or anionic\ndepending on the charge of fixed functional groups attached to its\nmatrix. The anion exchange resins are favored and better developed\nas the majority of currently established PFAS compounds are found\nto be anionic. 45  The ionic characteristics\nof IEX are commonly gained in the production process by methylation\nor quaternization. 13 , 46 − 50  Both iodomethane and chloromethane are considered\nforms of methylation, depending on the designed resin structure and\ncan result in the transfer of a cation methyl group to the resin matrix;\nwhile quaternization, on the other hand, adds a quaternary ammonium\ngroup composed of charged nitrogen atoms. Being one of the most established\nPFAS sorbents, the viability of IEX has been investigated in multiple\ntrials in recent decades, with merits reported in versatility, regenerability,\nefficiency, and capacity.\n\nHowever, restricted performance of\nIEX resins have been found in\ntrials with involvement of other soluble ionic impurities, resulting\nin sorption competition. 51  Current PFAS\nremoval technologies featuring electrostatic interaction typically\nremove waterborne contaminants nonspecifically, resulting in saturation\nby nonfluorinated species. 52  The competition\nsorption of other co-contaminants can clog ion-exchange sorbents,\nthus significantly impacting their PFAS sorption capacity and reducing\ntheir lifespan. 53  This makes the applications\nof these sorbents cost prohibitive.\n\n## Interplay among Different\nTypes of Interactions\n\nThe\ncooperation between hydrophobic, fluorous, and electrostatic segments\nin the sorbent design maximizes the sorption capacity, selectivity,\nand kinetics in the removal of PFAS, including the challenging short-chain\nPFAS. For instance, the porous polymers with quaternary ammonium segments\nare a good representation of combining hydrophobic and electrostatic\ninteractions. Liu et al. reported in their trial that electrostatically\nmodified porous aromatic framework (PAF) scored 14.8 times better\nperformance in PFOA adsorption than nonquaternized parent material,\nand 24.1 times higher than activated carbons accordingly. 54  Optimal performance on PFOS adsorption was also\nwitnessed in a modified cationic porous chitosan bead biosorbent. 55  The metal–organic frameworks, a novel\nfield of coordination polymers, can be another example of where hydrophobic\nand electrostatic interactions collaborate with each other. 56  A positive correlation was found between value\nof specific surface area (SSA) and sorption capacity, whereas cationic\ncharacteristics was found to augment capacity even in conditions with\ndecreased SSA. 57  In another study regarding\nthe sorption of both short-chain and long-chain PFAS, extraordinary\nremoval efficiency was found using cationic porous β-cyclodextrin\npolymer (cyclic oligosaccharides containing seven  d -glucose\nunits) even at low resin concentrations at 1 mg L –1  ( Figure  1 a). 58  The PFOA concentration was reduced from 1 μg\nL –1  to less than 10 ng L –1  using\nβ-cyclodextrin, which is approximately 7 times lower than the\nregulatory requirements of the U.S. EPA. 58 , 59  As found in those studies, combination of electrostatic interaction\nwith hydrophobicity can elevate resin adsorption performance, while\nlack of selectivity remains unsolved in this combination strategy.\n\nSummarization\nof chemical structures of interplay PFAS sorbents.\n(a) Porous β-cyclodextrin polymers [adapted from refs ( 58 ,  60 ,  61 ). Copyright\n2022, 2017, and 2020, respectively, American Chemical Society], (b)\nmagnetic fluorinated polymer, (c) ionic fluorogels [adapted from ref ( 50 ). Copyright 2020, American\nChemical Society], and (d) fluorophilic amine-functionalized redox-active\ncopolymers.\n\nRecent achievements seek combinations\nof fluorous, electrostatic,\nand/or hydrophobic interactions to overcome the above challenges and\nenable efficient capture of PFAS under a real contaminated environment,\nincluding short-chain PFAS. A recent study in our group reported the\ninnovation of a new magnetic fluorinated polymer sorbent ( Figure  1 b), featuring incorporation\nof fluorous (perfluoropolyether) and electrostatic (quaternary ammonium)\ninteractions. Such a sorbent was found to have improved performance\non the removal of both short-chain and long-chain PFAS, reaching >99%\nremoval efficiency within 30 s, even in the presence of co-contaminants. 46  Notably, the removal of an emerging ammonium\nsalt of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) reaches a high\nsorption capacity of 219 mg g –1  based on the Langmuir\nmodel. The superior performance is also evidenced by the ease of multiple\nregenerations by washing with a methanol salt solution. In addition\nto the previously mentioned porous β-cyclodextrins based on\nhydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, fluorinated β-cyclodextrins\nhave also been employed in PFAS adsorption, incorporating fluorous\ninteractions ( Figure  1 a). Examples include decafluorobiphenyl β-cyclodextrins (DFB-CDP)\nand pentafluorobenzaldehyde amine β-cyclodextrins. Both modifications\nhave demonstrated exceptional performance in PFAS removal. DFB-CDP,\nfor instance, was reported to be ten times more effective than GAC,\nwhile amine β-cyclodextrins exhibited the highest affinity for\nPFAS and GenX among the designed CD-based adsorbents. 60 , 61  In addition, an ionic fluorogel (IF) ( Figure  1 c) is another form of design that creditably\nillustrates the combination of electrostatic and fluorophilic interactions.\nIn trials carried out by Kumarsamy et al., a commercially available\nperfluoropolyether was copolymerized with an amine monomer, ionized,\nand sieved for assessments of PFAS removal. 50  Their study indicates significantly higher affinity and capacity\nfor both long- and short-chain PFAS removals in batch studies. In\nreal water trials, water sourced from PFAS contaminated sites with\n1.3 mg/L total organic content (TOC) were tested, with liquid chromatography–mass\nspectrometry (LC-MS) results indicating nondetectable long-chain PFAS\nconcentration and over 95% removal efficiency of shorter chain PFAS\nincluding perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), GenX, and perfluorohexanoic\nacid (PFHxA). The flexibility and diversity in monomer selection have\nalso made the improvement in IF structure and design easier to be\nachieved. In another trial carried out in 2022, hydrolytically stable\nIF sorbents were reported to be effective sorbents for removing 21\nlegacy and emerging PFAS from natural water, and they demonstrated\nregenerability across multiple reuse cycles. 62  The fluorophilic amine-functionalized redox-active polymer reported\nby Román Santiago et al. ( Figurer  1 d) has also demonstrated the role of fluorous\ninteraction in facilitating binding of shorter chain PFAS, particularly\nthose with lower hydrophobicity. 63  A 2%\nfluorination was also found to be the percentage demonstrating optimal\ncooperation between electrostatic and fluorous interactions.\n\nThe role of each type of interaction plays was assessed in our\nprevious reports, of which the relative contributions of fluorous\nand electrostatic interactions were assessed using 1D and 2D  19 F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and isothermal titration\ncalorimetry (ITC). 17  A fast exchange between\nbonded and free PFOA was observed in the sorbent material featuring\nthe fluorine–fluorine interaction, whereas electrostatic interaction\nwas associated with tight binding without such exchange. Evidence\nalso shows that fluorous interaction exhibits greater strength and\nefficiency at higher PFAS concentrations, whereas electrostatic interaction\nplays dominantly in low PFAS concentrations. 17  In a research trial conducted by Román Santiago et al., various\ncopolymers incorporating redox-active, electrostatic, and fluorophilic\ninteractions were evaluated against perfluoroalkyl acids ranging from\nchain lengths four to seven. 63  The copolymers,\nespecially those with introduced fluorinated segments, exhibited notably\nimproved capture efficiency for shorter-chain PFAS. This suggests\na pivotal role of the fluorine–fluorine interaction in capturing\nmore hydrophilic PFAS compounds, particularly those with shorter chain\nlengths. Additionally, their adsorption and desorption studies highlighted\ndiffering mechanisms of PFAS adsorption in the presence of long-chain\nPFHxS and short-chain PFBA, underscoring the effectiveness of employing\nvarious interactions in designing advanced PFAS sorbents.\n\n## Perspectives\nand Outlook\n\nFirst being recognized as a potential health\nrisk factor in 2002,\nPFAS chemicals are globally distributed pollutants that rapidly gained\nconcern worldwide. Regulatory bodies are increasingly emphasizing\nthe need to reduce the release and distribution of PFAS into the environment\ndue to their persistent and potentially hazardous nature. To date,\nthe granular activated carbon (GAC) and ion exchange (IEX) resins\nremain the two dominant and mostly established treatment methods through\nhydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Yet limited performance\nof these sorbents has been found in trials associated with the removal\nof short-chain PFAS (C < 6) and the presence of soluble co-contaminants.\nChallenges posed in current sorbent development include (1) limited\nremoval capacity and selectivity due to competitive sorption of other\nco-contaminants; (2) low effectiveness in the removal of short-chain\nPFAS; and (3) difficulty in regeneration of the sorbent.\n\nWhen designing an efficient\nPFAS sorbent, it is crucial to consider the influence of the functional\ngroup and chain length of PFAS compounds. These factors determine\nthe electrostatics, hydrophobicity, and fluorophilicity, all of which\nplay significant roles in how sorbent materials perform in capturing\nPFAS compounds effectively.  Figure  2  provides an overview of widely explored PFAS compounds\ncategorized based on functional groups and chain length. Chain length,\nstrongly linked to hydrophobicity and fluorophilicity, is a critical\nfactor. For instance, in various trials, resins designed to target\nlong-chain PFAS such as PFOA and PFOS often demonstrate constrained\nperformance for short chain PFAS such as PFBA due to increased hydrophilicity.\nAdditionally, the type of charged head of targeted PFAS compounds,\ninfluencing the strength of the electrostatic interaction, should\nbe considered. Although the majority of PFAS compounds are anionic,\ncationic, and neutral, PFAS compounds can also be present under specific\nconditions. Therefore, designing efficient sorbent, e.g., cationic\nexchange resin and porous sorbent, targeting the removal of cationic\nand neutral PFAS compounds is also required.\n\nChemical structures of\nwidely explored PFAS compounds.\n\nCurrently, the majority\nof newly reported PFAS sorbents have been tested for sorption of PFAS\nwith carbon numbers ranging from 4 to 12. However, it is imperative\nto design efficient sorbents that can effectively remove ultrashort\nchain PFAS which present a significant challenge due to their high\nwater solubility. Besides, the importance of parameters chosen for\nassessing resin performance, such as sorption kinetics, sorption capacity,\nand removal efficiency, should be considered. The adsorption capacity\nemphases on the maximum amount of PFAS sorbed per unit, whereas sorption\nkinetics assesses the time length required for reaching sorption equilibrium,\nand removal efficiency mimics how much PFAS can be captured by a certain\namount of sorbent. In addition, a primary challenge for developing\nPFAS removal technology is the presence of nonfluorinated organic\nand inorganic species at 3–8 orders of magnitude higher concentration\nthan PFAS. Current PFAS removal technologies typically remove waterborne\ncontaminants nonspecifically, resulting in saturation by nonfluorinated\nspecies. The competition sorption of other co-contaminants can clog\nion-exchange sorbents and saturate activated carbons, thus significantly\nimpacting their PFAS sorption capacity and reducing their lifespan.\nTherefore, developing novel sorbents that have good selectivity to\nthe removal of PFAS is a key research direction in the future.\n\nIn summary, we summarized three predominant interactions behind current\nsorbent development, i.e., hydrophobic, fluorous, and electrostatic\ninteractions, as well as the key role of PFAS structure. The mechanism\nbehind the scenes is explained, with applications of each interaction\ntype and their combinations illustrated. The combined strategies have\nhigher sorption capacity and removal efficiency compared with monointeraction\ntype, whereas the fluorine–fluorine interaction gained a particular\ntrend of interest due to its extraordinary performance on sorption\nselectivity. The fluorous interaction, referred to as the attractive\nforce between molecules or functional groups with fluorine atoms,\ndistinguishes this strategy from others. Thus, the development of\nfluorine-cooperated charged sorbents could be a promising solution\nto circumvent deficiencies in the current design of efficient PFAS\nsorbents. However, it is noteworthy that existing regulations could\nintroduce additional complexities into the production of fluorinated\nsorbents. Consequently, the development and use of fluorinated sorbents\nmight encounter more stringent requirements and approval processes\nto ensure that their production, application, and eventual disposal\nare in alignment with environmental and human health protection.\n\n## Perspective\nfrom PFAS Structure\n\nWhen designing an efficient\nPFAS sorbent, it is crucial to consider the influence of the functional\ngroup and chain length of PFAS compounds.
