  "abstract": "Delayed toxicity is a phenomenon observed for aquatic\ninvertebrates\nexposed to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists, such\nas neonicotinoids. Furthermore, recent studies have described an incomplete\nelimination of neonicotinoids by exposed amphipods. However, a mechanistic\nlink between receptor binding and toxicokinetic modeling has not been\ndemonstrated yet. The elimination of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid\nin the freshwater amphipod  Gammarus pulex  was studied in several toxicokinetic exposure experiments, complemented\nwith in vitro and in vivo receptor-binding assays. Based on the results,\na two-compartment model was developed to predict the uptake and elimination\nkinetics of thiacloprid in  G. pulex . An incomplete elimination of thiacloprid, independent of elimination\nphase duration, exposure concentrations, and pulses, was observed.\nAdditionally, the receptor-binding assays indicated irreversible binding\nof thiacloprid to the nAChRs. Accordingly, a toxicokinetic-receptor\nmodel consisting of a structural and a membrane protein (including\nnAChRs) compartment was developed. The model successfully predicted\ninternal thiacloprid concentrations across various experiments. Our\nresults help in understanding the delayed toxic and receptor-mediated\neffects toward arthropods caused by neonicotinoids. Furthermore, the\nresults suggest that more awareness toward long-term toxic effects\nof irreversible receptor binding is needed in a regulatory context.\nThe developed model supports the future toxicokinetic assessment of\nreceptor-binding contaminants.",

      "text": "Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely\napplied classes of insecticides\nglobally, 1 , 2  with seven of them being commercially available\nworldwide: imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin,\nacetamiprid, nitenpyram, and dinotefuran (molecular structures are\nprovided in  Supporting Information  A1). 2 , 3  However, the widespread use and toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides\ntoward numerous non-target insect species, particularly pollinators, 4 , 5  resulted in several bans of these insecticides in the last decade\n(i.e., imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid for\noutdoor usage in the EU). 6  Nevertheless,\nneonicotinoids are still extensively used in most other countries,\nsuch as the USA 7  and China. 8  Furthermore, the butenolide insecticide flupyradifurone,\nwhich potentially exerts less toxicity toward pollinators but has\na similar mode of action, was introduced as a replacement candidate\nin 2015. 9\n\nSeveral properties of neonicotinoids\ncontributed to their worldwide\nadoption and versatility, replacing more problematic insecticides\nsuch as carbamates and organophosphates. 10  Neonicotinoids are persistent, water-soluble, systemic, and highly\nselective insecticides with low toxicity and bioaccumulation potential\nin vertebrates. 3 , 11  Neonicotinoids interfere with\nneural transmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates\n( Figure  1 ). They act\nas (partial) agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)\nand compete with the endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh).\nIn contrast to ACh, neonicotinoids are not hydrolyzed by acetylcholine\nesterase, leading to their prolonged action at the nAChRs. 12  This interference causes continuous activation\nof the nAChRs, ultimately resulting in symptoms of neurotoxicity,\nsuch as paralysis. Differences in the subunits of the receptors in\nvertebrates and arthropod species result in a much stronger affinity\nand subsequent toxicity of neonicotinoids toward arthropods, with\ninsects being the most sensitive class. 3 , 13\n\nIllustration\nof the competition of neonicotinoids and ACh for nAChRs\nin the synaptic cleft. The hydrolysis of ACh by ACh-esterase is visualized\nwith a dotted arrow. The nAChR is composed of five subunits and corresponding\npotential agonist-binding sites.\n\nBesides pollinators, neonicotinoids also affect\naquatic organisms\nas they can reach surface waters through spray drift or run-off events. 5  Since neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides\ndesigned for fast uptake and distribution in plants, contaminated\nplant material may be another route of neonicotinoid exposure. 14 , 15  Recent studies have shown that the pollution levels of neonicotinoids\nin water bodies often exceed the environmental quality standards, 5 , 16  provoking mostly chronic adverse effects on aquatic, non-target\narthropods. Both acute and delayed toxicity, 17  as well as long recovery times (i.e., 10 weeks up to more than 7\nmonths), 18 − 20  have been observed in thiacloprid-exposed aquatic\ninvertebrates, such as  Gammarus pulex  (Linnaeus, 1758), during laboratory and mesocosm experiments. Gammarids\nare frequently used in aquatic monitoring studies 21 , 22  due to their ecological importance for detritus decomposition, trophic\ntransfer of nutrients and contaminants, 23  and widespread occurrence. 21 , 24  They are also typical\nnon-target organisms and can take up contaminants through the gills\n(respiration) or their diet (i.e., contaminated leaves). 21\n\nThe enrichment of a substance from the\nwater phase into an organism\nis called bioconcentration. 25  In the regulatory\nregistration process of chemicals, bioconcentration factors (BCFs)\nand toxicokinetic rates are commonly determined in uptake and elimination\nexperiments with fish, according to OECD 305. 25  Due to ethical considerations, analogously designed studies for\ninvertebrates were proposed as an alternative. 26 , 27  Commonly, toxicokinetic parameters are derived using a simplified\none-compartment approach. 28  However, exploring\nthe kinetics of certain compounds requires more complex (i.e., two-compartment)\napproaches to be sufficiently captured. 28 − 30  Such is the case for\nneonicotinoids, as recent studies indicate that these substances are\nnot completely eliminated from amphipods in neither laboratory 31 , 32  nor field 22  environments.\n\nWe hypothesized\nthat the irreversible binding to the nAChRs causes\nthe elimination resistance. For testing this hypothesis, we characterized\nthe non-eliminating fraction of thiacloprid in G. pulex  by performing several uptake-elimination experiments with a prolonged\nelimination phase and different exposure concentrations and exposure\npatterns (i.e., pulsed exposure). We selected thiacloprid because\nit was still permitted for use in Switzerland in 2019 and was found\nin field experiments in gammarids even when no thiacloprid was detected\nin the surface water. 22  The relevance of\nbinding to nAChRs for the elimination resistance of thiacloprid was\nevaluated by performing both in vivo and in vitro nAChR-binding assays.\nThereby, irreversible binding was defined as no measurable depletion\non the experimental time scale of up to 8 days. Eventually, based\non the combined results of the uptake-elimination experiments and\nreceptor-binding assays, a toxicokinetic model was developed to account\nfor compounds with specific receptor-binding properties and to help\nunderstand long-term toxic effects caused by irreversible binding."

      "text": "Specimens of  G. pulex  were collected from an uncontaminated creek 32 , 34  near Zurich (Mönchaltdorfer Aa, 47.2749 °N, 8.7892 °E),\nlocated in a landscape conservation area. The sampling and experimental\ntimeline covered the months of October (kinetic experiment I and concentration\ndependence II and III), November (pulsed exposure IV), and January\n(in vivo and in vitro receptor-binding assays V and VI) at water temperatures\nof 12, 7, and 1 °C, respectively. Genetic specifications of the\npopulation are provided elsewhere. 32  Gammarids\nwere kept in artificial pond water (APW) 33  with a pH of 7.9 and at 15.5 °C. Details on the acclimation\nprocedure are provided in  Supporting Information  A2. Lipid content was determined gravimetrically ( Supporting Information  A3). 32  Data\nfor lipid, protein, and thiacloprid contents are reported on a wet\nweight basis but can be converted to a dry weight basis using an experimentally\ndetermined factor of 5.4. 32\n\nToxicokinetic experiments\nconsisted of an uptake phase, where gammarids were exposed to test\nmedium containing thiacloprid, followed by an elimination phase, where\ngammarids were transferred to medium without thiacloprid. The exposure\nmedium was renewed every 5 days. All experiments were conducted in\naerated 6 L glass tanks filled with APW, if not specified otherwise.\nA water temperature of 15.5 ± 1 °C and a 12:12 h light–dark\ncycle were maintained during the experiments. Gammarids were only\nfed during the elimination phase to avoid the sorption of thiacloprid\nto leaves and subsequent dietary uptake of sorbed thiacloprid. General\nexperimental designs, as well as exposure times and concentrations,\nare displayed in  Table  1 .\n\nThree subsequent sequences of exposure\nand elimination were applied.\n\nTest conditions are specified in\nthe in vitro receptor-binding section.\n\nIn order to confirm the previously observed incomplete\nelimination\nof thiacloprid from amphipods, 32  a kinetic\nexperiment with a prolonged elimination phase was performed ( Table  1 , I). Samples were\ntaken in duplicate at regular time intervals.\n\nTo test a potential\nconcentration dependence of thiacloprid bioconcentration\n(i.e., due to a maximal binding capacity), gammarids were exposed\nto seven different thiacloprid concentrations ( Table  1 , II and III). The exposure and elimination\ntimes were chosen to guarantee steady state conditions of both exposure\nand elimination. However, no steady state was reached during the uptake\nphase of the 0.05 μg L –1  exposure. Gammarids\nwere sampled in triplicate at the end of the exposure and elimination\nphases. Additionally, samples for more time points (every 5 days)\nwere taken during the exposure to 0.5 and 0.05 μg L –1  in order to obtain kinetic data for the toxicokinetic-receptor model.\n\nTo evaluate whether the residual thiacloprid body burden increases\nwhen gammarids are repeatedly exposed to thiacloprid, gammarids were\nexposed to three consecutive pulses of thiacloprid ( Table  1 , IV). During each of the three\npulses, gammarids were sampled in triplicate on days 1, 2, 3, and\n5 of each pulse.\n\nSupplementing toxicokinetic experiments, including\ninvestigations\non thiacloprid sorption to the exoskeleton and the contribution of\nphysiological activity (i.e., respiration) to toxicokinetics using\ndead gammarids, are described in  Supporting Information  A4 and A10.\n\nGammarids that died during the experiments were\nremoved from the\ntest system and not sampled. Shortly before the start of each experiment,\n(<1 h) control samples of medium and gammarids were taken. Gammarids\nfor tissue analysis (4 per replicate) were collected, rinsed with\nnanopure water, dry blotted, weighed (wet weight), snap frozen in\nliquid nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C until extraction.\n\nTissue extracts were prepared by\nliquid extraction, as described elsewhere. 34  First, 300 mg of 1 mm zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products, Inc.),\n100 μL of internal standard (ISTD, 250 μg L –1  thiacloprid- d 4  in methanol), and 500\nμL of methanol were added. Then, samples were homogenized using\na tissue homogenizer (2 × 15 s at 6 m s –1 ;\nFastPrep, MP Biomedicals) before centrifugation (10,000 g , 6 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was collected using syringes\nand filtered through 0.45 μm regenerated cellulose filters (BGB\nAnalytic AG). Filters were washed with 400 μL of pure methanol,\nand the two collected filtrates were combined. Medium samples (500\nμL) were collected from the tanks, spiked with 100 μL\nof ISTD, and mixed with 400 μL of methanol.\n\nTotal protein and membrane protein (MP) content was determined\nbased on isolation methods adapted from Maloney et al. 35  The workflow is illustrated in  Supporting Information  A5. In brief, gammarid samples were\ntaken shortly before (<1 h) the corresponding toxicokinetic experiments\nstarted, dry blotted on paper tissue, weighed, and snap frozen in\nliquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenized using approximately 300\nmg of 1 mm zirconia/silica beads (pre-cooled 4 °C, BioSpec Products,\nInc.) with a pre-cooled tissue lyser (15 s, 6 s –1 , 4 °C; Bead Ruptor Elite, OMNI International). Next, dissociation\nmedium (DM) was added (1 mL/per sample, 4 °C) to the tubes, and\nsamples were homogenized again. The DM consisted of a buffer of 20\nmM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.0), as well as\n0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid (EDTA), 0.33 mg L –1  pepstatin, 0.33 mg L –1  chymostatin, and 0.33 mg L –1  leupeptin\nfor protease inhibition. Samples were centrifuged (30 min, 1000 g , 4 °C), and the supernatant (SN1) was collected with\na pipette. The pellet was resuspended in DM (1 mL/sample, 4 °C)\nand centrifuged again (10 min, 1000 g , 4 °C),\nand the supernatant (SN2) was combined with SN1 in 8 mL ultracentrifuge\nvials. A subsample of the combined supernatants was used for the determination\nof the total protein content. Afterward, the volume was adjusted to\n7 mL using cold DM, and samples were ultracentrifuged (43,000 g , 30 min, 4 °C, Ultracentrifuge CP100NX, Hitachi).\nSubsequently, the supernatant was carefully removed with a pipette,\nand the pellet was resuspended (MP extract) in 4 mL of DM. The concentrations\nof proteins in the supernatant and MP extract were quantified using\nthe Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and calculated\nas described in  Supporting Information  A5.\n\nFor the in vivo receptor assay, exposed gammarids ( Table  1 , V) were sampled at the end\nof the exposure and at the end of the elimination phase (12 replicates\neach). Six replicates were extracted using the liquid extraction method\nfor the determination of total thiacloprid content (recovery control).\nThe other six replicates (fractionation) were treated as follows ( Figure  2 ): membrane protein\nextraction was performed as described above. Afterward, the MP pellet\nwas extracted for bound thiacloprid with 900 μL of MeOH after\nthe addition of 100 μL ISTD and filtered through 0.45 μm\ncellulose filters. Additionally, thiacloprid was extracted from the\ndebris (particles at the bottom after centrifugation at 1000 g ) and in the supernatant (after ultracentrifugation at\n43,000 g ). The debris was extracted using methanol\nas described for gammarid tissue extractions. The supernatant was\nsampled like the medium samples (see  sample preparation ). The measured thiacloprid concentrations were normalized to the\ntotal body weight.\n\nTwo performed nAChR-binding approaches (in vivo: top,\nin vitro:\nbottom). DM = dissociation medium. The fractions analyzed by online-SPE\nLC-HRMS/MS (debris, supernatant, membrane protein) are indicated by\nbold letters.\n\nThe in vitro nAChR\nbinding assay was performed based on the methods described by Maloney\net al. 35  The methods were adapted to our\nfacilities and to the use of non-radioactively labeled thiacloprid\n( Figure  2 ). The receptor-binding\nassay was prepared by combining 0.27 mg of MP (0.5 mL of MP extract)\nand 6 mL of Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4) spiked with thiacloprid\nin 8 mL ultracentrifuge vials. Final concentrations of thiacloprid\nin the vials corresponded to 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 nM. Each concentration\nwas tested in four technical replicates split over multiple runs of\nthe assay (8 vials each). After incubation for 2 h at 23 °C and\n100 rpm, samples were ultracentrifuged (43,000 g ,\n30 min, 4 °C). The incubation medium was sampled by combining\n500 μL of the supernatant with 400 μL of MeOH and 100\nμL of ISTD. The rest of the supernatant was removed, the pellet\nwas resuspended in 6.5 mL of Tris–HCl, and the suspension was\nultracentrifuged again. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed,\nand the pellet was extracted for thiacloprid concentration, as described\nfor gammarid tissue extractions. Each assay included a protein recovery\ncontrol in order to correct the measured receptor-bound amount of\nthiacloprid for the MP lost during the extraction steps.\n\nAll collected samples were stored\nat −20 °C until chemical analysis. Chemical analysis was\nperformed using an automated online solid phase extraction system\ncoupled with reversed phase (C18 column, Atlantis T3, 5 μm,\n3 × 150 mm) liquid chromatography and high-resolution tandem\nmass spectrometry (online-SPE-LC-HRMS/MS) using the Orbitrap technology\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Ionization was performed using an\nelectrospray ionization interface. Specifications on the used mass\nspectrometers and the parameter settings are provided in  Supporting Information  A6.\n\nThiacloprid\nwas quantified in positive mode with the internal standard using TraceFinder\n5.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) for peak integration. Additionally,\na suspect screening using commonly known transformation products of\nthiacloprid was performed. Detailed information on quality control\nand quantification is provided in  Supporting Information  A7.\n\nTotal tissue bioconcentration factors\n(BCF SS,total  in L kg –1 ) under steady-state\nconditions were calculated for the toxicokinetic experiments II and\nIII as the ratio of measured total tissue concentration at the end\nof the uptake phase ( C tissue,u ) and the\naverage measured exposure concentration ( C water ) 1\n\nAdditionally, corresponding BCFs of\nthe structure (further defined in the following section,  Figure  3 ) compartment (BCF SS,structure  in L kg –1 ) for the concentration-dependent\ntoxicokinetic experiment were determined by subtracting the elimination-resistant\nfraction at the end of the elimination phase ( C tissue,e ) from the concentration at the end of the uptake phase 2\n\nIllustration of the toxicokinetic-receptor model\nbased on  eqs  5  and  6 . The volume of the water basin is assumed to be\ninfinite compared\nto the volume of exposed gammarids. The weight ratio of the membrane\nprotein (MP) and the structure compartment is defined as FMS (MP content,\nhere 1%). Elimination from the MP compartment was set to zero ( k off  = 0) because no elimination could be determined\nduring the toxicokinetic experiments and model development.\n\nReceptor-binding properties of thiacloprid were\nmodeled from the\nin vitro assay by determining the maximal irreversible binding parameter  B max  (μmol kg MP –1 ) and the equilibrium dissociation constant  K d  (nM).  B max  is indicative of the\nmaximum number of nAChR binding sites. Correspondingly, it is also\na measure of the nAChR density of an organism if each receptor contains\none specific binding site for thiacloprid. The equilibrium dissociation\nconstant  K d  represents the binding affinity\nof thiacloprid to nAChRs and is defined as the ligand concentration\nto achieve a half-maximum binding at equilibrium. 36\n\nThe specific binding ( C specific , μmol\nkg MP –1 ) model accounted for one-site,\nspecific binding under equilibrium conditions 3 where  C free  (nM)\nis the concentration in the in vitro receptor-binding assay medium.\nThe model was applied to the assay medium concentrations of 0 to 25\nnM because unspecific binding at these concentrations was negligible\ncompared to specific binding. Receptor-binding was modeled in GraphPad\nPrism 9.4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The modeled receptor-binding\nparameters were additionally confirmed using an unspecific binding\nmodel with an extended set of medium concentrations ( Supporting Information  A8).\n\nStatistical analysis and\ndata visualization were performed using\nGraphPad Prism 9.4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Significant differences\nbetween categorical variables were tested by ANOVA if not stated otherwise.\nThe level of significance was set to 0.05. Normal distribution and\nhomoscedasticity of the residuals were assumed. The law of error propagation\nwas applied to all calculations. 37\n\nA toxicokinetic model, including\nreceptor-binding (toxicokinetic-receptor model), was developed to\ndescribe the observed toxicokinetics of thiacloprid in  G. pulex . Receptor models describing the kinetics\nof ligand–receptor complexes have been previously described\nfor other organisms 38 , 39  and discussed in the context\nof toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic models. 40  Irreversible binding of thiacloprid to the nAChR was the core assumption\nof our model. Specifically, we assumed a two-compartment model with\na structure (S) and a MP compartment incorporated into the structure\ncompartment ( Figure  3 ). While there is a bidirectional exchange between the structure\ncompartment of the organism and the environment (i.e., water), the\ninteraction of the structure compartment with the MP compartment is\nunidirectional due to irreversible receptor binding ( k off  = 0). There is no direct interaction between water\nand the MP compartment. The model assumptions and reasoning are described\nin further detail in  Supporting Information  A9.\n\nThe formation of the ligand–receptor complex and\nits dissociation can be described through an ordinary differential\nequation. The change of the concentration of ligand-bound receptors,\nhere approximated as the change of the thiacloprid concentration in\nthe MP compartment  C MP  (μmol kg MP –1 ) over time  t  (d), depends\non the ligand (thiacloprid) concentration in the structure compartment  C structure  (μmol kg structure –1 ) and the concentration of free receptors  N R  (μmol kg MP –1 ) multiplied with the second-order rate  k on  (kg structure  μmol –1  d –1 ). The first order rate  k off  (d –1 ) determines the dissociation of the complex, depending on the concentration\nof ligand-bound receptors. 4\n\nOur experimental results indicated\nan irreversible binding of thiacloprid\nat the temporal scale of the experiments. Furthermore, no parameter\nvalue for  k off  significantly different\nfrom zero could be determined. Thus, the dissociation rate  k off  was set to zero. With these observations,\nthe assumption that the total number of receptors  N R0  (μmol kg MP –1 ) is\nequal to the sum of ligand-bound receptors ( N RL ) and free receptors ( N R  =  N R0  –  N RL ),\nand further approximating  N R0  as the maximal\nbinding capacity  B max  (μmol kg MP –1 ),  eq  4  can be rearranged as follows 5\n\nThe concentration in the structure\ncompartment  C structure  can be determined\nusing the following ordinary\ndifferential equation 6 where  k u  (L kg structure –1  d –1 ) is the\nuptake rate,  C W  (μM) is the water\nconcentration of the exposure medium,  k e  (d –1 ) is the elimination rate, and FMS (0.01 kg MP  kg structure –1 ) is the factor\nto correct the proportion of MP compared to the structure compartment.\n\nThe total tissue concentration  C total  (μmol kg –1 ) can be approximated as 7\n\nThe modeled kinetic bioconcentration\nfactor (BCF kin,structure  in L kg –1 ) in\nthe structure compartment was determined\nas the ratio of  k u  and  k e 8\n\nThe internal concentrations derived\nfrom the toxicokinetic experiments\nwere used to calibrate and validate the toxicokinetic-receptor model\n( eqs  5 – 7 ). Model calibration was done with data of constant\nexposures (0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, and 1500 μg L –1 ). The parameter space explorer 41  was\nused for the optimization of the model parameter and to produce the\nconfidence intervals of the model curves. The resulting best-fit model\nparameters were subsequently used to simulate model predictions. To\nvalidate this approach, the predictions were compared with both constant\n(5, 50, 500, and 5000 μg L –1 ) and pulsed (5\nand 50 μg L –1 ) exposure scenarios. All calculations\nwere performed in MATLAB 2021b using the Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)\nmodeling platform ( https://www.debtox.info/byom.html , version 6.2).

Next, dissociation\nmedium (DM) was added (1 mL/per sample, 4 °C) to the tubes, and\nsamples were homogenized again. The DM consisted of a buffer of 20\nmM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.0), as well as\n0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid (EDTA), 0.33 mg L –1  pepstatin, 0.33 mg L –1  chymostatin, and 0.33 mg L –1  leupeptin\nfor protease inhibition. Samples were centrifuged (30 min, 1000 g , 4 °C), and the supernatant (SN1) was collected with\na pipette. The pellet was resuspended in DM (1 mL/sample, 4 °C)\nand centrifuged again (10 min, 1000 g , 4 °C),\nand the supernatant (SN2) was combined with SN1 in 8 mL ultracentrifuge\nvials. A subsample of the combined supernatants was used for the determination\nof the total protein content. Afterward, the volume was adjusted to\n7 mL using cold DM, and samples were ultracentrifuged (43,000 g , 30 min, 4 °C, Ultracentrifuge CP100NX, Hitachi).\nSubsequently, the supernatant was carefully removed with a pipette,\nand the pellet was resuspended (MP extract) in 4 mL of DM. The concentrations\nof proteins in the supernatant and MP extract were quantified using\nthe Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and calculated\nas described in  Supporting Information  A5.\n\nFor the in vivo receptor assay, exposed gammarids ( Table  1 , V) were sampled at the end\nof the exposure and at the end of the elimination phase (12 replicates\neach). Six replicates were extracted using the liquid extraction method\nfor the determination of total thiacloprid content (recovery control).\nThe other six replicates (fractionation) were treated as follows ( Figure  2 ): membrane protein\nextraction was performed as described above. Afterward, the MP pellet\nwas extracted for bound thiacloprid with 900 μL of MeOH after\nthe addition of 100 μL ISTD and filtered through 0.45 μm\ncellulose filters. Additionally, thiacloprid was extracted from the\ndebris (particles at the bottom after centrifugation at 1000 g ) and in the supernatant (after ultracentrifugation at\n43,000 g ). The debris was extracted using methanol\nas described for gammarid tissue extractions. The supernatant was\nsampled like the medium samples (see  sample preparation ). The measured thiacloprid concentrations were normalized to the\ntotal body weight.\n\nTwo performed nAChR-binding approaches (in vivo: top,\nin vitro:\nbottom). DM = dissociation medium.

      "text": "A toxicokinetic model, including\nreceptor-binding (toxicokinetic-receptor model), was developed to\ndescribe the observed toxicokinetics of thiacloprid in  G. pulex . Receptor models describing the kinetics\nof ligand–receptor complexes have been previously described\nfor other organisms 38 , 39  and discussed in the context\nof toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic models. 40  Irreversible binding of thiacloprid to the nAChR was the core assumption\nof our model. Specifically, we assumed a two-compartment model with\na structure (S) and a MP compartment incorporated into the structure\ncompartment ( Figure  3 ). While there is a bidirectional exchange between the structure\ncompartment of the organism and the environment (i.e., water), the\ninteraction of the structure compartment with the MP compartment is\nunidirectional due to irreversible receptor binding ( k off  = 0). There is no direct interaction between water\nand the MP compartment. The model assumptions and reasoning are described\nin further detail in  Supporting Information  A9.\n\nThe formation of the ligand–receptor complex and\nits dissociation can be described through an ordinary differential\nequation. The change of the concentration of ligand-bound receptors,\nhere approximated as the change of the thiacloprid concentration in\nthe MP compartment  C MP  (μmol kg MP –1 ) over time  t  (d), depends\non the ligand (thiacloprid) concentration in the structure compartment  C structure  (μmol kg structure –1 ) and the concentration of free receptors  N R  (μmol kg MP –1 ) multiplied with the second-order rate  k on  (kg structure  μmol –1  d –1 ). The first order rate  k off  (d –1 ) determines the dissociation of the complex, depending on the concentration\nof ligand-bound receptors. 4\n\nOur experimental results indicated\nan irreversible binding of thiacloprid\nat the temporal scale of the experiments. Furthermore, no parameter\nvalue for  k off  significantly different\nfrom zero could be determined. Thus, the dissociation rate  k off  was set to zero. With these observations,\nthe assumption that the total number of receptors  N R0  (μmol kg MP –1 ) is\nequal to the sum of ligand-bound receptors ( N RL ) and free receptors ( N R  =  N R0  –  N RL ),\nand further approximating  N R0  as the maximal\nbinding capacity  B max  (μmol kg MP –1 ),  eq  4  can be rearranged as follows 5\n\nThe concentration in the structure\ncompartment  C structure  can be determined\nusing the following ordinary\ndifferential equation 6 where  k u  (L kg structure –1  d –1 ) is the\nuptake rate,  C W  (μM) is the water\nconcentration of the exposure medium,  k e  (d –1 ) is the elimination rate, and FMS (0.01 kg MP  kg structure –1 ) is the factor\nto correct the proportion of MP compared to the structure compartment.\n\nThe total tissue concentration  C total  (μmol kg –1 ) can be approximated as 7\n\nThe modeled kinetic bioconcentration\nfactor (BCF kin,structure  in L kg –1 ) in\nthe structure compartment was determined\nas the ratio of  k u  and  k e 8\n\nThe internal concentrations derived\nfrom the toxicokinetic experiments\nwere used to calibrate and validate the toxicokinetic-receptor model\n( eqs  5 – 7 ). Model calibration was done with data of constant\nexposures (0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, and 1500 μg L –1 ). The parameter space explorer 41  was\nused for the optimization of the model parameter and to produce the\nconfidence intervals of the model curves. The resulting best-fit model\nparameters were subsequently used to simulate model predictions.

Lipid contents were in a similar range\nto that observed elsewhere. 32 , 42  The observed decrease\nin lipid content from fall to winter may be due to the use of energy\nreserves, such as storage lipids. 42  No\nlipid normalization of accumulated thiacloprid was performed, as lipid\ncontent was demonstrated to have no significant influence on the bioconcentration\nof polar organic contaminants in amphipods. 32\n\nThe total protein content (wet weight basis) across the experiments\nranged from 4.4 to 5.0% and is within the range reported for other\ngammarid populations. 42  The average MP\ncontent was 1.0 ± 0.1%, which is higher than that reported for\nother aquatic invertebrates and methods. 35\n\nThe measured medium concentrations\nof all performed toxicokinetic experiments were within 20% of the\nnominal concentrations ( Supporting Information  B), which is in line with the OECD 305 requirements. 25  Concentrations of the elimination medium were\nbelow the limit of quantification (generally 0.01 μg L –1 , but 0.001 for the low exposure concentrations of 0.5 and 0.05 μg\nL –1 ), confirming a neglectable impact for reuptake\nfrom the medium, except for minor residues after exposure with concentrations\n≥500 μg L –1 . Relative O 2  saturation (>85%), pH (7.9 ± 0.1) and water temperatures\nwere\nstable (15.5 ± 1 °C) during the experiments.\n\nThe\ninternal concentrations of gammarids exposed to different concentrations\nof thiacloprid (0.5–5000 μg L –1 ) increased\nsignificantly along the concentration gradient from an average of\n0.23 ± 0.03 to 39 ± 4 μmol kg –1  at\nthe end of the uptake phase ( Figure  4 ). An approximation of steady state conditions was\nassumed based on the visually observed saturation in the kinetic experiments\n(i.e., pulsed exposure for ≥5 μg L –1 ) or kinetic measurements (0.5 μg L –1 ). The\ndifference in internal concentration between the lowest and the highest\nconcentration was only a factor of 150, despite a 10,000-fold difference\nin exposure concentration. The developed toxicokinetic model ( Table  3 ) demonstrated that\nsteady-state conditions would be reached within the exposure time\nwindow for all applied exposure concentrations except for 0.05 μg\nL –1 . At the end of the elimination phase, no significant\ndifference between remaining tissue concentrations was observed (0.18\n± 0.04 to 0.39 ± 0.13 μmol kg –1 ).\nFurthermore, no statistical difference between tissue concentrations\nat the end of the exposure and elimination phases was observed for\nconcentrations equal to or lower than 5 μg L –1 . Thus, the present data indicate a concentration dependence of the\nwhole-body bioconcentration of thiacloprid in  G. pulex  due to a saturation of the second, elimination-resistant MP compartment.\n\nInternal\nconcentrations (left) of thiacloprid at the end of the\nuptake and elimination phases at different exposure concentrations.\nCalculated uncorrected  BCF SS,total  and\nthe  BCF SS,structure  (right). Data are\npresented as individual data points and mean ± SD ( n  = 3). Letters indicate significant differences between the groups\n(two-way ANOVA,  p  < 0.05, log transformation,\nTukey’s post-hoc test). For 0.05 μg L –1  (m), data were modeled using the toxicokinetic-receptor model because\nno steady state was reached during this experiment (20 days).\n\nIn order to account for the two-compartment bioconcentration\nkinetics,\ntwo different BCFs were calculated ( Figure  4 ). The BCF SS,total  was calculated\nfrom the tissue and medium concentration at the end of the uptake\nphase ( eq  1 ), representing\nthe whole body concentration. It showed a clear concentration dependence,\nranging from 1.9 ± 0.2 L kg –1  at the highest\nexposure concentration toward a 60 times higher value (109 ±\n14 L kg –1 ) at the lowest exposure concentration\nthat reached a steady state (0.5 μg L –1 ).\nThe BCF SS,structure , calculated by subtracting the elimination-resistant\nfraction from the total tissue concentration ( eq  2 ), resulted in much more similar BCFs (2.5\n± 0.8 L kg –1 ), which were also in the range\nof the modeled BCF kin,structure  (2.0 L kg –1 ,  eq  8 ) of the structure\ncompartment. The difference between the BCF SS,total  and\nBCF SS,structure  was not significantly different for the\nhigh exposure concentrations (500 to 5000 μg L –1 ) due to the small relative contribution of the MP compartment to\nthe whole body concentration.\n\nAll calculated\nBCF SS,total  in the present study were\nbelow the B criterion (BCF ≥ 2000 L kg –1 ) 25  threshold and in range of those reported for\nneonicotinoids in  G. pulex  and other\naquatic species (0.2–70). 20 , 28 , 43 , 44  However, considering\nthe increasing BCF SS,total  with decreasing exposure concentration—caused\nby the saturation of the MP compartment—the BCF of thiacloprid\nwould continue to increase at lower, field-relevant concentrations.\nFor instance, at concentrations below 30 ng L –1 ,\nthe BCF SS,total  could increase above the regulatory threshold\n(BCF ≥ 2000 L kg –1 ) and at ≤12 ng\nL –1  above the very bioaccumulative criterion (BCF\n≥ 5000 L kg –1 ), given a long enough exposure\ntime. Measured neonicotinoid concentrations in surface waters are\ntypically in this ng L –1  range. 5 , 16 , 22  Thus, the concentration dependence of neonicotinoid\naccumulation would also explain the much higher accumulation of neonicotinoids\nobserved in the field compared to laboratory studies. 22\n\nPrevious investigations that determined internal\nconcentrations\nof neonicotinoids in crustaceans 20  may\nnot have observed such two-compartment kinetics because of very high\n(mg L –1  range) exposure concentrations masking the\nelimination-resistant fraction (e.g., 5000 μg L –1 ,  Figure  4 ). These\nhigh-exposure concentrations were applied due to the low acute toxicity\nof neonicotinoids toward crustaceans but probably also to guarantee\na proper quantification of the compound in tissue samples. The methods\napplied in the present study facilitated the determination of medium\nand tissue concentrations of exposure experiments down to the ng L –1  range and allowed the detection of the elimination-resistant\nthiacloprid amount. Thus, testing bioconcentration at lower exposure\nconcentrations may improve the detection and understanding of discrepancies\nbetween laboratory and field experiments. 22\n\nThe measured tissue concentrations\nin gammarids exposed to three consecutive pulses of thiacloprid are\nshown in  Figure  5 .\nIn the 50 μg L –1  exposure treatment, all internal\nconcentrations were, on average, three times higher during the uptake\nphase after 1 and 2 days (0.76 ± 0.04 μmol kg –1 ) than during the elimination phase (0.23 ± 0.03 μmol\nkg –1 ). A similar pattern but lower internal concentrations\nat the end of the uptake phases were observed in the 5 μg L –1  treatment ( Supporting Information  A11). The measured internal concentrations, including the elimination-resistant\nfraction after 1 and 3 days of elimination, were similar to the concentrations\nmeasured in the concentration-dependent toxicokinetic experiments.\nThus, the pulsed exposure experiment supported the observed elimination\nresistance of the MP compartment. Furthermore, it was demonstrated\nthat the non-eliminating residues reached the maximum binding capacity\nalready after the first exposure pulse and remained unchanged afterward.\nThese results may help in interpreting toxic effects observed in pulsed\nexposure scenarios elsewhere. 19 , 45\n\nInternal thiacloprid\nconcentrations in  G. pulex  sampled\nduring the pulsed exposure experiment at 50 μg L –1 . Lines represent the average (±SD,  n  = 18)\ntissue concentration determined in gammarids sampled during\nthe uptake phase (gray) and elimination phase (orange). Significant\ndifferences within each exposure pulse concentration are indicated\nby letters (two-way ANOVA,  p  < 0.05, Tukey’s\npost-hoc test).\n\nThe amount of thiacloprid recovered\nin the in vivo receptor-binding assay matched the concentrations of\nthe conventionally extracted (whole body burden) samples of both the\nexposure and elimination phases ( Figure  6 ). After the uptake phase, most thiacloprid\nwas recovered in the supernatant (64%), followed by MPs (19%) and\ndebris (16%). Thiacloprid associated with different fractions may\nbe interpreted as follows: (1) supernatant = free thiacloprid (i.e.,\nstructure compartment) or thiacloprid detached from MPs or associated\nwith MPs that were not separated during ultracentrifugation, (2) debris\n= thiacloprid that was not extracted by the DM (i.e., incomplete MP\nextraction, association with the exoskeleton, incorporation into un-lysed\ntissue), and (3) membrane protein = thiacloprid associated with membrane\nproteins such as the nAChRs. Binding or sorption to the exoskeleton\n(i.e., debris fraction, exuviae analysis  Supporting Information  A4) seemed to be of low importance for thiacloprid\nbody burdens, other than what was suggested for other chemicals in\ncrustaceans in earlier reports. 20 , 22\n\nThiacloprid concentrations\nrecovered in different fractions of\nthe in vivo nAChR binding assay presented as stacked bar plots. The\ngray line indicates the concentration determined from the unfractionated\nextract (lower line = elimination, upper line = uptake). Data are\npresented as mean ± SD ( n  = 6). Significant\ndecreases from the end of uptake to the end of the elimination phase\nare indicated by asterisks (n.s. =  p  ≥ 0.05,\n** =  p  < 0.01, *** =  p  < 0.001;\ntwo-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post-hoc test).\n\nThe amount of thiacloprid in the supernatant and\nthe debris decreased\nsignificantly by more than 90 and 60%, respectively, during the elimination\nphase. In contrast, thiacloprid concentrations in MP remained constant\nfrom the exposure to the elimination phase. At the end of the elimination\nphase, thiacloprid associated with MP accounted for the largest amount\n(61%) of the total body burden. The in vivo receptor-binding assay\nindicated that the elimination-resistant fraction of thiacloprid in  G. pulex  may be caused by irreversible binding to\nparts of the MPs, such as the nAChRs.\n\nParameters from the one-site specific binding model\n( R 2  = 0.83,  Supporting Information  A8) of the in vitro ligand binding assay are presented\nin  Table  2 . Similar\nparameters\nwere estimated with the unspecific binding model ( B max  = 5.5 and  K d  = 0.41,  Supporting Information  A8). While the CI of  B max  was narrow (<15%),  K d  was estimated with considerable uncertainty due to the\ninsufficient coverage of the binding isotherm in the proximate region\nof  K d  (Scatchard plot). However, even\nin previous studies covering lower exposure concentrations and with\na more sensitive radio-labeled method, similar confidence intervals\nwere obtained. 35  An extrapolation of  B max  to the whole organism ( C B max ), correcting for MP recovery\nafter the in vitro assay (24%) and MP content (1%) resulted in a whole-body\nconcentration of 0.24 μmol kg –1 . Such concentration\nis in a similar range to the elimination-resistant fraction determined\nin the toxicokinetic experiments, including the estimated  C B max  of the toxicokinetic-receptor\nmodel ( Table  3 ) and an in vivo binding assay. Thus, the\nutilization of in vivo and in vitro receptor-binding assays seemed\nto be sufficient to upscale receptor-binding processes to the whole\norganism level, which provides potential for novel toxicokinetic research\napproaches.\n\nParameters are presented with the\ncorresponding 95% CIs (confidence intervals).  R 2  = 0.83.  C B max  = maximal nAChR-bound thiacloprid extrapolated to the whole\nbody of  G. pulex  predicted using the\nMP content FMS (1%) and the MP recovery rate of 24% throughout the\nin vitro assay.  C B max  is equal to the receptor density in the whole organism, assuming\none binding site per receptor.\n\nC B max  = Maximal nAChR-bound thiacloprid amount extrapolated\nto the whole body of G. pulex using the\nmembrane protein content FMS (1%).\n\nBoundary of the parameter space\nexplorer.\n\nThe  B max  values obtained\nfrom the in\nvivo receptor-binding assay may be compared to existing studies with\nimidacloprid, as both imidacloprid and thiacloprid were suggested\nto bind to the same nAChR-binding site (one of five subunits) in cockroach\nneurons. 46  Therefore, the  B max  values of the two neonicotinoids may also be indicative\nfor the receptor densities in different arthropod species. Maloney\net al. 35  reported  B max  values for imidacloprid in 13 invertebrate species ranging\nfrom 51 × 10 –6  to 6.5 μmol kg MP –1 . The  B max  for thiacloprid\nin  G. pulex  was closest to the values\nreported for imidacloprid in  Chironomus riparius  and  C. dilutus  larvae. 35  Since nAChRs are not only located in the peripheral\nand the central nervous systems but also in muscular tissues, 47  the high binding capacity in both organism types\nmay result from a high proportion of muscular tissue ( Supporting Information  A12). A compartmentation\nof the neonicotinoid imidacloprid into the nervous system and muscle\ntissue was also indicated in a radio-imaging study on gammarids. 148  Furthermore, it should be noted that similar\nmolar concentrations of imidacloprid at the end of the elimination\nphase from toxicokinetic experiments with two other  G. pulex  populations 31 , 48  were comparable\nto the observations for thiacloprid in the present study. These findings\nsupport the suggested similar nAChR-binding capabilities of the two\nneonicotinoids in gammarids.\n\nThe methods from Maloney et al. 35  using\nradiolabeled imidacloprid could be sufficiently adapted to less specialized\nlaboratory equipment and the measurement of unlabeled ligands. However,\nthe adaptation resulted in several drawbacks, such as the need for\nlarger sample volumes and time-consuming ultracentrifugation. Possible\noptimizations, such as the reduction of the assay to a microplate\nlayout to reduce centrifugation steps and losses, are discussed in  Supporting Information  A13.\n\nThe thiacloprid concentrations\nin  G. pulex  tissue ( Figure  7 ) showed a steady increase\nduring the exposure phase of the kinetic experiments. The increase\nin tissue concentrations was slowing down considerably between days\n1 and 2 at exposure concentrations ≥5 μg L –1 . During the first day of the elimination phase, thiacloprid was\nrapidly removed from the structure compartment, but no elimination\noccurred from the MP compartment, which determines the remaining total\ntissue concentration. This behavior is consistent with the observations\nof the receptor-binding assays.\n\nTotal thiacloprid tissue concentrations\n(A,D), structure compartment\n(B,E), and MP compartment (C,F) concentrations presented as measured\nvalues (dots) and toxicokinetic-receptor model fits (lines) from the\nmodel calibration. Colored dotted lines represent the 95% CIs. Gray\ndotted lines indicate the change from the uptake to the elimination\nphase. Please note the different  y -axis scales. The\npresented MP concentration is up-scaled to the total tissue concentration\nto allow a better comparison. Underlying model parameters are provided\nin  Table  2 . The complete\ndataset is plotted in  Figure S6 .\n\nThe determined model parameters are provided in  Table  3 . The calibrated best-fit\nmodel\nparameter resulted in an overall  R 2  of\n0.99 in describing the measured total internal concentration of thiacloprid\nin  G. pulex . The quality of the fit\nby visual examination was deemed satisfactory ( Figures  7  and  S6 ). The\nprofile likelihoods ( Figure S7 , plots on\nthe diagonal) of  k u ,  k e , and  B max  were well defined\n(i.e., u-shaped and crossing the critical value on both ends).  k on  could not be identified, as this process\nseemed to be much faster than  k u  and the\ntime resolution of the observations. Therefore, the optimization algorithm\nhit the arbitrarily set upper limit for this parameter. Thus, the\nassociation process might be seen as instantaneous, given the available\ndataset. The likelihood-based joint-confidence regions ( Figure S7 , scatter plots) showed a strong correlation\nof the model parameters  k u  and  k e , expressed in their narrow-shaped ellipse.\nThe calibrated model showed high accuracy in predicting the measured\nconcentrations of the validation datasets for both constant ( Figure S8 ) and pulsed exposure scenarios ( Figure S9 ). Physiological inactivity of gammarids\n( Supporting Information  A11) had a noticeable\nimpact by reducing toxicokinetic rates but only minor effects on  B max  and  BCF kin,structure .\n\nOne assumption of the developed model was irreversible binding,\nwhich resulted in a fixed value of zero for  k off . No elimination of thiacloprid during the present experiments\ncould be observed by statistical or modeling means. However, this\nassumption may not hold true for much longer experimental times. For\ninstance, a recovery time of 45 days was determined by toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic\n(TK–TD) modeling for imidacloprid-exposed daphnids, 20  but no recovery was identified for gammarids\nin a different study. 48  In competition-binding\nassays, it was demonstrated that the binding affinity of neonicotinoids\nis much higher than that of acetylcholine, but neonicotinoids may\nstill be removed if acetylcholine is available in large excess. 49  This mechanism may eventually result in a slow\nrecovery of affected nAChRs. Furthermore, organisms may recover by\ndeconstructing affected receptors and generating new receptors dynamically.\nThese mechanisms may also lead to lower  B max  values at very low exposure concentrations (≪ 0.5 μg\nL –1 ), which take a considerably longer time to reach\nthe maximal  C MP  concentration.\n\nThe\ndeveloped model assumed well-mixed compartments as a simplification.\nHowever, this might not be appropriate for the representation of receptors\nin different organs. It is known that different nAChRs of various\norgan types (i.e., muscles and nervous system) are built from different\nsubunits. 50  The proportion of these receptor/subunit\ntypes may change across species, seasons, and developmental states,\nthus affecting the suitability of the applied MP content normalization.\nFurthermore, this may limit the extrapolation of the total nAChR density\nbased on receptor-bound neonicotinoids.\n\nThe profile likelihood\nanalysis revealed an identification problem\nwith the parameter  k on , whose upper boundary\ncould not be distinguished from infinity ( Figure S7 , plots on the diagonal). This problem can be associated\nwith so-called “fast kinetics” extensively discussed\nby experts before. 51  That is, when fast\nkinetics are observed, the steady-state is reached before the first\nmeasurement. In the present study, this was the case for the receptor-bound\nfraction because no independent kinetic measurements of the receptor-bound\nfraction were feasible. Thus, the data do not hold the exact information\nabout how quickly a steady state between the structure and the MP\ncompartment is achieved. To minimize the effect of this parameter\nand avoid numerical problems on the joint-confidence regions, the\nfixed boundary of the parameter space explorer (i.e., 200) was used\nas an upper boundary of  k on . Consequently,\nalso the assumption of instantaneous binding could be another way\nof simplifying the present model. The described observation is in\nline with the high receptor affinity of thiacloprid to nAChRs, indicating\nthat the speed of in vivo receptor-binding kinetics are limited by\nthe initial uptake of thiacloprid into the structure compartment.\n\nBiotransformation of thiacloprid in amphipods was neither reported\nin the literature nor found in a screening for reported biotransformation\nproducts (e.g., thiacloprid amide) in bacteria 52  ( Supporting Information  A7).\nThus, in order to also display toxicokinetics of neonicotinoids or\nother receptor-bound compounds that are biotransformed in amphipods\n(e.g. imidacloprid 43 , 53 ), the presented model may be\nextended by considering biotransformation. However, further research\nwould be needed in order to understand and implement the exact mechanisms\nof biotransformation, such as compartment-dependent biotransformation\nand binding of biotransformation products to the nAChRs.\n\nIn the present study,\nwe demonstrated that irreversible binding to MPs such as the nAChRs\nexplains the observed elimination resistance 22 , 31 , 32  of neonicotinoids from amphipod tissue.\nConsequently, this elimination-resistant fraction may explain the\ndelayed toxic effects and irreversible damages toward aquatic arthropods\nthat were previously reported. 17 , 18 , 45 , 53  In fact, the MP-associated fraction\nmay be interpreted as either irreversible damage to the nAChR or continuous\nexposure due to elimination resistance, depending on the point of\nview. The here-provided mechanistic insights may help to improve the\nunderstanding of toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics, and adverse outcome\npathways of neonicotinoids in arthropods. Such considerations may\nbe important for the risk assessment of neonicotinoids, as well as\ntheir replacement candidates (i.e., flupyradifurone 9 ) and other contaminants with (irreversible) receptor-binding\nproperties. Furthermore, existing TK–TD modeling approaches 19 , 48 , 53 , 54  may be updated based on the present findings.\n\nThe standard\nbioaccumulation assessment, according to OECD 305 25  using fish, generally assumes one-compartment kinetics,\nan independence of bioaccumulation parameters from exposure concentrations\nand a relevance of bioaccumulation only for compounds with high log  K OW  values. However, our toxicokinetic investigations\non neonicotinoids in aquatic invertebrates demonstrated a strong exposure\nconcentration dependence due to a maximum binding capacity and no\nelimination from the MP compartment. These mechanisms may result in\nBCFs above the threshold value for the B criterion (2000) at concentrations\ntypically observed in the environment (ng L –1  range). 5 , 16  In contrast to multi-compartment kinetics caused by sorption to\nexoskeleton/cuticula of aquatic invertebrates, 55  the here-reported second compartment consists of a bioactive,\nand thus toxicologically relevant, fraction. Similar mechanisms for\nelimination-resistant bioactive fractions may exist for other compound\nclasses with observed multi-compartment kinetics, such as strobilurins\nin amphipods. 26 , 32  However, further research is\nneeded to understand the underlying mechanisms and their toxicological\nrelevance. In order to account for concentration-dependent bioaccumulation,\na category such as “elimination-resistant” or “receptor-bound”\nmay be important for establishing new testing guidelines, i.e., for\nthe proposed bioaccumulation studies using arthropods. 27 , 56  With our developed toxicokinetic-receptor model, we provide the\nrequired modeling platform for such implementations.\n\nFurthermore,\nthe usefulness of environmental threshold concentrations\nfor elimination-resistant compounds such as neonicotinoids may be\nreconsidered. 16  Exposed organisms may accumulate\nneonicotinoids over their lifetime and eventually reach saturation\nof the nAChRs, regardless of the exposure concentration. Additionally,\nthis resistance toward elimination may explain trophic magnification\nin arthropods and transfer from aquatic to terrestrial food webs observed\nfor neonicotinoids elsewhere. 57  Furthermore,\nenvironmental parameters may have an impact on the toxicokinetics\nof neonicotinoids. For instance, temperature was demonstrated to exert\nan exponential relationship with uptake and elimination rates in amphipods. 32  This may result in much faster saturation of\nthe nAChRs, especially if high water concentrations co-occur with\nhigher temperatures, such as during a run-off event in the summer,\nand consequently enhance the exposure risks toward aquatic arthropods.\nHowever, further investigations of the interaction of temperature\nand neonicotinoid exposure are needed to evaluate this risk."

The difference between the BCF SS,total  and\nBCF SS,structure  was not significantly different for the\nhigh exposure concentrations (500 to 5000 μg L –1 ) due to the small relative contribution of the MP compartment to\nthe whole body concentration.\n\nAll calculated\nBCF SS,total  in the present study were\nbelow the B criterion (BCF ≥ 2000 L kg –1 ) 25  threshold and in range of those reported for\nneonicotinoids in  G. pulex  and other\naquatic species (0.2–70). 20 , 28 , 43 , 44  However, considering\nthe increasing BCF SS,total  with decreasing exposure concentration—caused\nby the saturation of the MP compartment—the BCF of thiacloprid\nwould continue to increase at lower, field-relevant concentrations.\nFor instance, at concentrations below 30 ng L –1 ,\nthe BCF SS,total  could increase above the regulatory threshold\n(BCF ≥ 2000 L kg –1 ) and at ≤12 ng\nL –1  above the very bioaccumulative criterion (BCF\n≥ 5000 L kg –1 ), given a long enough exposure\ntime.

After the uptake phase, most thiacloprid\nwas recovered in the supernatant (64%), followed by MPs (19%) and\ndebris (16%). Thiacloprid associated with different fractions may\nbe interpreted as follows: (1) supernatant = free thiacloprid (i.e.,\nstructure compartment) or thiacloprid detached from MPs or associated\nwith MPs that were not separated during ultracentrifugation, (2) debris\n= thiacloprid that was not extracted by the DM (i.e., incomplete MP\nextraction, association with the exoskeleton, incorporation into un-lysed\ntissue), and (3) membrane protein = thiacloprid associated with membrane\nproteins such as the nAChRs. Binding or sorption to the exoskeleton\n(i.e., debris fraction, exuviae analysis  Supporting Information  A4) seemed to be of low importance for thiacloprid\nbody burdens, other than what was suggested for other chemicals in\ncrustaceans in earlier reports. 20 , 22\n\nThiacloprid concentrations\nrecovered in different fractions of\nthe in vivo nAChR binding assay presented as stacked bar plots. The\ngray line indicates the concentration determined from the unfractionated\nextract (lower line = elimination, upper line = uptake). Data are\npresented as mean ± SD ( n  = 6). Significant\ndecreases from the end of uptake to the end of the elimination phase\nare indicated by asterisks (n.s. =  p  ≥ 0.05,\n** =  p  < 0.01, *** =  p  < 0.001;\ntwo-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post-hoc test).\n\nThe amount of thiacloprid in the supernatant and\nthe debris decreased\nsignificantly by more than 90 and 60%, respectively, during the elimination\nphase. In contrast, thiacloprid concentrations in MP remained constant\nfrom the exposure to the elimination phase. At the end of the elimination\nphase, thiacloprid associated with MP accounted for the largest amount\n(61%) of the total body burden. The in vivo receptor-binding assay\nindicated that the elimination-resistant fraction of thiacloprid in  G. pulex  may be caused by irreversible binding to\nparts of the MPs, such as the nAChRs.\n\nParameters from the one-site specific binding model\n( R 2  = 0.83,  Supporting Information  A8) of the in vitro ligand binding assay are presented\nin  Table  2 . Similar\nparameters\nwere estimated with the unspecific binding model ( B max  = 5.5 and  K d  = 0.41,  Supporting Information  A8). While the CI of  B max  was narrow (<15%),  K d  was estimated with considerable uncertainty due to the\ninsufficient coverage of the binding isotherm in the proximate region\nof  K d  (Scatchard plot). However, even\nin previous studies covering lower exposure concentrations and with\na more sensitive radio-labeled method, similar confidence intervals\nwere obtained. 35  An extrapolation of  B max  to the whole organism ( C B max ), correcting for MP recovery\nafter the in vitro assay (24%) and MP content (1%) resulted in a whole-body\nconcentration of 0.24 μmol kg –1 . Such concentration\nis in a similar range to the elimination-resistant fraction determined\nin the toxicokinetic experiments, including the estimated  C B max  of the toxicokinetic-receptor\nmodel ( Table  3 ) and an in vivo binding assay. Thus, the\nutilization of in vivo and in vitro receptor-binding assays seemed\nto be sufficient to upscale receptor-binding processes to the whole\norganism level, which provides potential for novel toxicokinetic research\napproaches.\n\nParameters are presented with the\ncorresponding 95% CIs (confidence intervals).  R 2  = 0.83.  C B max  = maximal nAChR-bound thiacloprid extrapolated to the whole\nbody of  G. pulex  predicted using the\nMP content FMS (1%) and the MP recovery rate of 24% throughout the\nin vitro assay.  C B max  is equal to the receptor density in the whole organism, assuming\none binding site per receptor.\n\nC B max  = Maximal nAChR-bound thiacloprid amount extrapolated\nto the whole body of G. pulex using the\nmembrane protein content FMS (1%).\n\nBoundary of the parameter space\nexplorer.\n\nThe  B max  values obtained\nfrom the in\nvivo receptor-binding assay may be compared to existing studies with\nimidacloprid, as both imidacloprid and thiacloprid were suggested\nto bind to the same nAChR-binding site (one of five subunits) in cockroach\nneurons. 46  Therefore, the  B max  values of the two neonicotinoids may also be indicative\nfor the receptor densities in different arthropod species. Maloney\net al. 35  reported  B max  values for imidacloprid in 13 invertebrate species ranging\nfrom 51 × 10 –6  to 6.5 μmol kg MP –1 . The  B max  for thiacloprid\nin  G. pulex  was closest to the values\nreported for imidacloprid in  Chironomus riparius  and  C. dilutus  larvae. 35  Since nAChRs are not only located in the peripheral\nand the central nervous systems but also in muscular tissues, 47  the high binding capacity in both organism types\nmay result from a high proportion of muscular tissue ( Supporting Information  A12). A compartmentation\nof the neonicotinoid imidacloprid into the nervous system and muscle\ntissue was also indicated in a radio-imaging study on gammarids. 148  Furthermore, it should be noted that similar\nmolar concentrations of imidacloprid at the end of the elimination\nphase from toxicokinetic experiments with two other  G. pulex  populations 31 , 48  were comparable\nto the observations for thiacloprid in the present study. These findings\nsupport the suggested similar nAChR-binding capabilities of the two\nneonicotinoids in gammarids.\n\nThe methods from Maloney et al. 35  using\nradiolabeled imidacloprid could be sufficiently adapted to less specialized\nlaboratory equipment and the measurement of unlabeled ligands. However,\nthe adaptation resulted in several drawbacks, such as the need for\nlarger sample volumes and time-consuming ultracentrifugation. Possible\noptimizations, such as the reduction of the assay to a microplate\nlayout to reduce centrifugation steps and losses, are discussed in  Supporting Information  A13."

For instance, temperature was demonstrated to exert\nan exponential relationship with uptake and elimination rates in amphipods. 32  This may result in much faster saturation of\nthe nAChRs, especially if high water concentrations co-occur with\nhigher temperatures, such as during a run-off event in the summer,\nand consequently enhance the exposure risks toward aquatic arthropods.\nHowever, further investigations of the interaction of temperature\nand neonicotinoid exposure are needed to evaluate this risk."

Furthermore, recent studies have described an incomplete\nelimination of neonicotinoids by exposed amphipods. However, a mechanistic\nlink between receptor binding and toxicokinetic modeling has not been\ndemonstrated yet. The elimination of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid\nin the freshwater amphipod  Gammarus pulex  was studied in several toxicokinetic exposure experiments, complemented\nwith in vitro and in vivo receptor-binding assays. Based on the results,\na two-compartment model was developed to predict the uptake and elimination\nkinetics of thiacloprid in  G. pulex . An incomplete elimination of thiacloprid, independent of elimination\nphase duration, exposure concentrations, and pulses, was observed.\nAdditionally, the receptor-binding assays indicated irreversible binding\nof thiacloprid to the nAChRs. Accordingly, a toxicokinetic-receptor\nmodel consisting of a structural and a membrane protein (including\nnAChRs) compartment was developed. The model successfully predicted\ninternal thiacloprid concentrations across various experiments. Our\nresults help in understanding the delayed toxic and receptor-mediated\neffects toward arthropods caused by neonicotinoids. Furthermore, the\nresults suggest that more awareness toward long-term toxic effects\nof irreversible receptor binding is needed in a regulatory context.\nThe developed model supports the future toxicokinetic assessment of\nreceptor-binding contaminants.\n\n## Introduction\n\nNeonicotinoids are one of the most widely\napplied classes of insecticides\nglobally, 1 , 2  with seven of them being commercially available\nworldwide: imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin,\nacetamiprid, nitenpyram, and dinotefuran (molecular structures are\nprovided in  Supporting Information  A1). 2 , 3  However, the widespread use and toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides\ntoward numerous non-target insect species, particularly pollinators, 4 , 5  resulted in several bans of these insecticides in the last decade\n(i.e., imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid for\noutdoor usage in the EU). 6  Nevertheless,\nneonicotinoids are still extensively used in most other countries,\nsuch as the USA 7  and China. 8  Furthermore, the butenolide insecticide flupyradifurone,\nwhich potentially exerts less toxicity toward pollinators but has\na similar mode of action, was introduced as a replacement candidate\nin 2015. 9\n\nSeveral properties of neonicotinoids\ncontributed to their worldwide\nadoption and versatility, replacing more problematic insecticides\nsuch as carbamates and organophosphates. 10  Neonicotinoids are persistent, water-soluble, systemic, and highly\nselective insecticides with low toxicity and bioaccumulation potential\nin vertebrates. 3 , 11  Neonicotinoids interfere with\nneural transmission in the central nervous system of invertebrates\n( Figure  1 ). They act\nas (partial) agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)\nand compete with the endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh).\nIn contrast to ACh, neonicotinoids are not hydrolyzed by acetylcholine\nesterase, leading to their prolonged action at the nAChRs. 12  This interference causes continuous activation\nof the nAChRs, ultimately resulting in symptoms of neurotoxicity,\nsuch as paralysis. Differences in the subunits of the receptors in\nvertebrates and arthropod species result in a much stronger affinity\nand subsequent toxicity of neonicotinoids toward arthropods, with\ninsects being the most sensitive class. 3 , 13\n\nIllustration\nof the competition of neonicotinoids and ACh for nAChRs\nin the synaptic cleft. The hydrolysis of ACh by ACh-esterase is visualized\nwith a dotted arrow. The nAChR is composed of five subunits and corresponding\npotential agonist-binding sites.\n\nBesides pollinators, neonicotinoids also affect\naquatic organisms\nas they can reach surface waters through spray drift or run-off events. 5  Since neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides\ndesigned for fast uptake and distribution in plants, contaminated\nplant material may be another route of neonicotinoid exposure. 14 , 15  Recent studies have shown that the pollution levels of neonicotinoids\nin water bodies often exceed the environmental quality standards, 5 , 16  provoking mostly chronic adverse effects on aquatic, non-target\narthropods. Both acute and delayed toxicity, 17  as well as long recovery times (i.e., 10 weeks up to more than 7\nmonths), 18 − 20  have been observed in thiacloprid-exposed aquatic\ninvertebrates, such as  Gammarus pulex  (Linnaeus, 1758), during laboratory and mesocosm experiments. Gammarids\nare frequently used in aquatic monitoring studies 21 , 22  due to their ecological importance for detritus decomposition, trophic\ntransfer of nutrients and contaminants, 23  and widespread occurrence. 21 , 24  They are also typical\nnon-target organisms and can take up contaminants through the gills\n(respiration) or their diet (i.e., contaminated leaves). 21\n\nThe enrichment of a substance from the\nwater phase into an organism\nis called bioconcentration. 25  In the regulatory\nregistration process of chemicals, bioconcentration factors (BCFs)\nand toxicokinetic rates are commonly determined in uptake and elimination\nexperiments with fish, according to OECD 305. 25  Due to ethical considerations, analogously designed studies for\ninvertebrates were proposed as an alternative. 26 , 27  Commonly, toxicokinetic parameters are derived using a simplified\none-compartment approach. 28  However, exploring\nthe kinetics of certain compounds requires more complex (i.e., two-compartment)\napproaches to be sufficiently captured. 28 − 30  Such is the case for\nneonicotinoids, as recent studies indicate that these substances are\nnot completely eliminated from amphipods in neither laboratory 31 , 32  nor field 22  environments.\n\nWe hypothesized\nthat the irreversible binding to the nAChRs causes\nthe elimination resistance. For testing this hypothesis, we characterized\nthe non-eliminating fraction of thiacloprid in G. pulex  by performing several uptake-elimination experiments with a prolonged\nelimination phase and different exposure concentrations and exposure\npatterns (i.e., pulsed exposure). We selected thiacloprid because\nit was still permitted for use in Switzerland in 2019 and was found\nin field experiments in gammarids even when no thiacloprid was detected\nin the surface water. 22  The relevance of\nbinding to nAChRs for the elimination resistance of thiacloprid was\nevaluated by performing both in vivo and in vitro nAChR-binding assays.\nThereby, irreversible binding was defined as no measurable depletion\non the experimental time scale of up to 8 days. Eventually, based\non the combined results of the uptake-elimination experiments and\nreceptor-binding assays, a toxicokinetic model was developed to account\nfor compounds with specific receptor-binding properties and to help\nunderstand long-term toxic effects caused by irreversible binding.\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\nSpecimens of  G. pulex  were collected from an uncontaminated creek 32 , 34  near Zurich (Mönchaltdorfer Aa, 47.2749 °N, 8.7892 °E),\nlocated in a landscape conservation area. The sampling and experimental\ntimeline covered the months of October (kinetic experiment I and concentration\ndependence II and III), November (pulsed exposure IV), and January\n(in vivo and in vitro receptor-binding assays V and VI) at water temperatures\nof 12, 7, and 1 °C, respectively. Genetic specifications of the\npopulation are provided elsewhere. 32  Gammarids\nwere kept in artificial pond water (APW) 33  with a pH of 7.9 and at 15.5 °C. Details on the acclimation\nprocedure are provided in  Supporting Information  A2. Lipid content was determined gravimetrically ( Supporting Information  A3). 32  Data\nfor lipid, protein, and thiacloprid contents are reported on a wet\nweight basis but can be converted to a dry weight basis using an experimentally\ndetermined factor of 5.4. 32\n\nToxicokinetic experiments\nconsisted of an uptake phase, where gammarids were exposed to test\nmedium containing thiacloprid, followed by an elimination phase, where\ngammarids were transferred to medium without thiacloprid. The exposure\nmedium was renewed every 5 days. All experiments were conducted in\naerated 6 L glass tanks filled with APW, if not specified otherwise.\nA water temperature of 15.5 ± 1 °C and a 12:12 h light–dark\ncycle were maintained during the experiments. Gammarids were only\nfed during the elimination phase to avoid the sorption of thiacloprid\nto leaves and subsequent dietary uptake of sorbed thiacloprid. General\nexperimental designs, as well as exposure times and concentrations,\nare displayed in  Table  1 .\n\nThree subsequent sequences of exposure\nand elimination were applied.\n\nTest conditions are specified in\nthe in vitro receptor-binding section.\n\nIn order to confirm the previously observed incomplete\nelimination\nof thiacloprid from amphipods, 32  a kinetic\nexperiment with a prolonged elimination phase was performed ( Table  1 , I). Samples were\ntaken in duplicate at regular time intervals.\n\nTo test a potential\nconcentration dependence of thiacloprid bioconcentration\n(i.e., due to a maximal binding capacity), gammarids were exposed\nto seven different thiacloprid concentrations ( Table  1 , II and III). The exposure and elimination\ntimes were chosen to guarantee steady state conditions of both exposure\nand elimination. However, no steady state was reached during the uptake\nphase of the 0.05 μg L –1  exposure. Gammarids\nwere sampled in triplicate at the end of the exposure and elimination\nphases. Additionally, samples for more time points (every 5 days)\nwere taken during the exposure to 0.5 and 0.05 μg L –1  in order to obtain kinetic data for the toxicokinetic-receptor model.\n\nTo evaluate whether the residual thiacloprid body burden increases\nwhen gammarids are repeatedly exposed to thiacloprid, gammarids were\nexposed to three consecutive pulses of thiacloprid ( Table  1 , IV). During each of the three\npulses, gammarids were sampled in triplicate on days 1, 2, 3, and\n5 of each pulse.\n\nSupplementing toxicokinetic experiments, including\ninvestigations\non thiacloprid sorption to the exoskeleton and the contribution of\nphysiological activity (i.e., respiration) to toxicokinetics using\ndead gammarids, are described in  Supporting Information  A4 and A10.\n\nGammarids that died during the experiments were\nremoved from the\ntest system and not sampled. Shortly before the start of each experiment,\n(<1 h) control samples of medium and gammarids were taken. Gammarids\nfor tissue analysis (4 per replicate) were collected, rinsed with\nnanopure water, dry blotted, weighed (wet weight), snap frozen in\nliquid nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C until extraction.\n\nTissue extracts were prepared by\nliquid extraction, as described elsewhere. 34  First, 300 mg of 1 mm zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products, Inc.),\n100 μL of internal standard (ISTD, 250 μg L –1  thiacloprid- d 4  in methanol), and 500\nμL of methanol were added. Then, samples were homogenized using\na tissue homogenizer (2 × 15 s at 6 m s –1 ;\nFastPrep, MP Biomedicals) before centrifugation (10,000 g , 6 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was collected using syringes\nand filtered through 0.45 μm regenerated cellulose filters (BGB\nAnalytic AG). Filters were washed with 400 μL of pure methanol,\nand the two collected filtrates were combined. Medium samples (500\nμL) were collected from the tanks, spiked with 100 μL\nof ISTD, and mixed with 400 μL of methanol.\n\nTotal protein and membrane protein (MP) content was determined\nbased on isolation methods adapted from Maloney et al. 35  The workflow is illustrated in  Supporting Information  A5. In brief, gammarid samples were\ntaken shortly before (<1 h) the corresponding toxicokinetic experiments\nstarted, dry blotted on paper tissue, weighed, and snap frozen in\nliquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenized using approximately 300\nmg of 1 mm zirconia/silica beads (pre-cooled 4 °C, BioSpec Products,\nInc.) with a pre-cooled tissue lyser (15 s, 6 s –1 , 4 °C; Bead Ruptor Elite, OMNI International). Next, dissociation\nmedium (DM) was added (1 mL/per sample, 4 °C) to the tubes, and\nsamples were homogenized again. The DM consisted of a buffer of 20\nmM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.0), as well as\n0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid (EDTA), 0.33 mg L –1  pepstatin, 0.33 mg L –1  chymostatin, and 0.33 mg L –1  leupeptin\nfor protease inhibition. Samples were centrifuged (30 min, 1000 g , 4 °C), and the supernatant (SN1) was collected with\na pipette. The pellet was resuspended in DM (1 mL/sample, 4 °C)\nand centrifuged again (10 min, 1000 g , 4 °C),\nand the supernatant (SN2) was combined with SN1 in 8 mL ultracentrifuge\nvials. A subsample of the combined supernatants was used for the determination\nof the total protein content. Afterward, the volume was adjusted to\n7 mL using cold DM, and samples were ultracentrifuged (43,000 g , 30 min, 4 °C, Ultracentrifuge CP100NX, Hitachi).\nSubsequently, the supernatant was carefully removed with a pipette,\nand the pellet was resuspended (MP extract) in 4 mL of DM. The concentrations\nof proteins in the supernatant and MP extract were quantified using\nthe Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and calculated\nas described in  Supporting Information  A5.\n\nFor the in vivo receptor assay, exposed gammarids ( Table  1 , V) were sampled at the end\nof the exposure and at the end of the elimination phase (12 replicates\neach). Six replicates were extracted using the liquid extraction method\nfor the determination of total thiacloprid content (recovery control).\nThe other six replicates (fractionation) were treated as follows ( Figure  2 ): membrane protein\nextraction was performed as described above. Afterward, the MP pellet\nwas extracted for bound thiacloprid with 900 μL of MeOH after\nthe addition of 100 μL ISTD and filtered through 0.45 μm\ncellulose filters. Additionally, thiacloprid was extracted from the\ndebris (particles at the bottom after centrifugation at 1000 g ) and in the supernatant (after ultracentrifugation at\n43,000 g ). The debris was extracted using methanol\nas described for gammarid tissue extractions. The supernatant was\nsampled like the medium samples (see  sample preparation ). The measured thiacloprid concentrations were normalized to the\ntotal body weight.\n\nTwo performed nAChR-binding approaches (in vivo: top,\nin vitro:\nbottom). DM = dissociation medium. The fractions analyzed by online-SPE\nLC-HRMS/MS (debris, supernatant, membrane protein) are indicated by\nbold letters.\n\nThe in vitro nAChR\nbinding assay was performed based on the methods described by Maloney\net al. 35  The methods were adapted to our\nfacilities and to the use of non-radioactively labeled thiacloprid\n( Figure  2 ). The receptor-binding\nassay was prepared by combining 0.27 mg of MP (0.5 mL of MP extract)\nand 6 mL of Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4) spiked with thiacloprid\nin 8 mL ultracentrifuge vials. Final concentrations of thiacloprid\nin the vials corresponded to 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 nM. Each concentration\nwas tested in four technical replicates split over multiple runs of\nthe assay (8 vials each). After incubation for 2 h at 23 °C and\n100 rpm, samples were ultracentrifuged (43,000 g ,\n30 min, 4 °C). The incubation medium was sampled by combining\n500 μL of the supernatant with 400 μL of MeOH and 100\nμL of ISTD. The rest of the supernatant was removed, the pellet\nwas resuspended in 6.5 mL of Tris–HCl, and the suspension was\nultracentrifuged again. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed,\nand the pellet was extracted for thiacloprid concentration, as described\nfor gammarid tissue extractions. Each assay included a protein recovery\ncontrol in order to correct the measured receptor-bound amount of\nthiacloprid for the MP lost during the extraction steps.\n\nAll collected samples were stored\nat −20 °C until chemical analysis. Chemical analysis was\nperformed using an automated online solid phase extraction system\ncoupled with reversed phase (C18 column, Atlantis T3, 5 μm,\n3 × 150 mm) liquid chromatography and high-resolution tandem\nmass spectrometry (online-SPE-LC-HRMS/MS) using the Orbitrap technology\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Ionization was performed using an\nelectrospray ionization interface. Specifications on the used mass\nspectrometers and the parameter settings are provided in  Supporting Information  A6.\n\nThiacloprid\nwas quantified in positive mode with the internal standard using TraceFinder\n5.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) for peak integration. Additionally,\na suspect screening using commonly known transformation products of\nthiacloprid was performed. Detailed information on quality control\nand quantification is provided in  Supporting Information  A7.\n\nTotal tissue bioconcentration factors\n(BCF SS,total  in L kg –1 ) under steady-state\nconditions were calculated for the toxicokinetic experiments II and\nIII as the ratio of measured total tissue concentration at the end\nof the uptake phase ( C tissue,u ) and the\naverage measured exposure concentration ( C water ) 1\n\nAdditionally, corresponding BCFs of\nthe structure (further defined in the following section,  Figure  3 ) compartment (BCF SS,structure  in L kg –1 ) for the concentration-dependent\ntoxicokinetic experiment were determined by subtracting the elimination-resistant\nfraction at the end of the elimination phase ( C tissue,e ) from the concentration at the end of the uptake phase 2\n\nIllustration of the toxicokinetic-receptor model\nbased on  eqs  5  and  6 . The volume of the water basin is assumed to be\ninfinite compared\nto the volume of exposed gammarids. The weight ratio of the membrane\nprotein (MP) and the structure compartment is defined as FMS (MP content,\nhere 1%). Elimination from the MP compartment was set to zero ( k off  = 0) because no elimination could be determined\nduring the toxicokinetic experiments and model development.\n\nReceptor-binding properties of thiacloprid were\nmodeled from the\nin vitro assay by determining the maximal irreversible binding parameter  B max  (μmol kg MP –1 ) and the equilibrium dissociation constant  K d  (nM).  B max  is indicative of the\nmaximum number of nAChR binding sites. Correspondingly, it is also\na measure of the nAChR density of an organism if each receptor contains\none specific binding site for thiacloprid. The equilibrium dissociation\nconstant  K d  represents the binding affinity\nof thiacloprid to nAChRs and is defined as the ligand concentration\nto achieve a half-maximum binding at equilibrium. 36\n\nThe specific binding ( C specific , μmol\nkg MP –1 ) model accounted for one-site,\nspecific binding under equilibrium conditions 3 where  C free  (nM)\nis the concentration in the in vitro receptor-binding assay medium.\nThe model was applied to the assay medium concentrations of 0 to 25\nnM because unspecific binding at these concentrations was negligible\ncompared to specific binding. Receptor-binding was modeled in GraphPad\nPrism 9.4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The modeled receptor-binding\nparameters were additionally confirmed using an unspecific binding\nmodel with an extended set of medium concentrations ( Supporting Information  A8).\n\nStatistical analysis and\ndata visualization were performed using\nGraphPad Prism 9.4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Significant differences\nbetween categorical variables were tested by ANOVA if not stated otherwise.\nThe level of significance was set to 0.05. Normal distribution and\nhomoscedasticity of the residuals were assumed. The law of error propagation\nwas applied to all calculations. 37\n\nA toxicokinetic model, including\nreceptor-binding (toxicokinetic-receptor model), was developed to\ndescribe the observed toxicokinetics of thiacloprid in  G. pulex . Receptor models describing the kinetics\nof ligand–receptor complexes have been previously described\nfor other organisms 38 , 39  and discussed in the context\nof toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic models. 40  Irreversible binding of thiacloprid to the nAChR was the core assumption\nof our model. Specifically, we assumed a two-compartment model with\na structure (S) and a MP compartment incorporated into the structure\ncompartment ( Figure  3 ). While there is a bidirectional exchange between the structure\ncompartment of the organism and the environment (i.e., water), the\ninteraction of the structure compartment with the MP compartment is\nunidirectional due to irreversible receptor binding ( k off  = 0). There is no direct interaction between water\nand the MP compartment. The model assumptions and reasoning are described\nin further detail in  Supporting Information  A9.\n\nThe formation of the ligand–receptor complex and\nits dissociation can be described through an ordinary differential\nequation. The change of the concentration of ligand-bound receptors,\nhere approximated as the change of the thiacloprid concentration in\nthe MP compartment  C MP  (μmol kg MP –1 ) over time  t  (d), depends\non the ligand (thiacloprid) concentration in the structure compartment  C structure  (μmol kg structure –1 ) and the concentration of free receptors  N R  (μmol kg MP –1 ) multiplied with the second-order rate  k on  (kg structure  μmol –1  d –1 ). The first order rate  k off  (d –1 ) determines the dissociation of the complex, depending on the concentration\nof ligand-bound receptors. 4\n\nOur experimental results indicated\nan irreversible binding of thiacloprid\nat the temporal scale of the experiments. Furthermore, no parameter\nvalue for  k off  significantly different\nfrom zero could be determined. Thus, the dissociation rate  k off  was set to zero. With these observations,\nthe assumption that the total number of receptors  N R0  (μmol kg MP –1 ) is\nequal to the sum of ligand-bound receptors ( N RL ) and free receptors ( N R  =  N R0  –  N RL ),\nand further approximating  N R0  as the maximal\nbinding capacity  B max  (μmol kg MP –1 ),  eq  4  can be rearranged as follows 5\n\nThe concentration in the structure\ncompartment  C structure  can be determined\nusing the following ordinary\ndifferential equation 6 where  k u  (L kg structure –1  d –1 ) is the\nuptake rate,  C W  (μM) is the water\nconcentration of the exposure medium,  k e  (d –1 ) is the elimination rate, and FMS (0.01 kg MP  kg structure –1 ) is the factor\nto correct the proportion of MP compared to the structure compartment.\n\nThe total tissue concentration  C total  (μmol kg –1 ) can be approximated as 7\n\nThe modeled kinetic bioconcentration\nfactor (BCF kin,structure  in L kg –1 ) in\nthe structure compartment was determined\nas the ratio of  k u  and  k e 8\n\nThe internal concentrations derived\nfrom the toxicokinetic experiments\nwere used to calibrate and validate the toxicokinetic-receptor model\n( eqs  5 – 7 ). Model calibration was done with data of constant\nexposures (0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, and 1500 μg L –1 ). The parameter space explorer 41  was\nused for the optimization of the model parameter and to produce the\nconfidence intervals of the model curves. The resulting best-fit model\nparameters were subsequently used to simulate model predictions. To\nvalidate this approach, the predictions were compared with both constant\n(5, 50, 500, and 5000 μg L –1 ) and pulsed (5\nand 50 μg L –1 ) exposure scenarios. All calculations\nwere performed in MATLAB 2021b using the Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)\nmodeling platform ( https://www.debtox.info/byom.html , version 6.2). Model scripts are provided on GitHub ( https://github.com/NikaGoldring/TK-receptor ).\n\n## Test Animals\n\nSpecimens of  G. pulex  were collected from an uncontaminated creek 32 , 34  near Zurich (Mönchaltdorfer Aa, 47.2749 °N, 8.7892 °E),\nlocated in a landscape conservation area.

The DM consisted of a buffer of 20\nmM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride (pH 7.0), as well as\n0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid (EDTA), 0.33 mg L –1  pepstatin, 0.33 mg L –1  chymostatin, and 0.33 mg L –1  leupeptin\nfor protease inhibition. Samples were centrifuged (30 min, 1000 g , 4 °C), and the supernatant (SN1) was collected with\na pipette. The pellet was resuspended in DM (1 mL/sample, 4 °C)\nand centrifuged again (10 min, 1000 g , 4 °C),\nand the supernatant (SN2) was combined with SN1 in 8 mL ultracentrifuge\nvials. A subsample of the combined supernatants was used for the determination\nof the total protein content. Afterward, the volume was adjusted to\n7 mL using cold DM, and samples were ultracentrifuged (43,000 g , 30 min, 4 °C, Ultracentrifuge CP100NX, Hitachi).\nSubsequently, the supernatant was carefully removed with a pipette,\nand the pellet was resuspended (MP extract) in 4 mL of DM. The concentrations\nof proteins in the supernatant and MP extract were quantified using\nthe Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and calculated\nas described in  Supporting Information  A5.\n\nFor the in vivo receptor assay, exposed gammarids ( Table  1 , V) were sampled at the end\nof the exposure and at the end of the elimination phase (12 replicates\neach). Six replicates were extracted using the liquid extraction method\nfor the determination of total thiacloprid content (recovery control).\nThe other six replicates (fractionation) were treated as follows ( Figure  2 ): membrane protein\nextraction was performed as described above. Afterward, the MP pellet\nwas extracted for bound thiacloprid with 900 μL of MeOH after\nthe addition of 100 μL ISTD and filtered through 0.45 μm\ncellulose filters. Additionally, thiacloprid was extracted from the\ndebris (particles at the bottom after centrifugation at 1000 g ) and in the supernatant (after ultracentrifugation at\n43,000 g ). The debris was extracted using methanol\nas described for gammarid tissue extractions. The supernatant was\nsampled like the medium samples (see  sample preparation ). The measured thiacloprid concentrations were normalized to the\ntotal body weight.\n\nTwo performed nAChR-binding approaches (in vivo: top,\nin vitro:\nbottom). DM = dissociation medium. The fractions analyzed by online-SPE\nLC-HRMS/MS (debris, supernatant, membrane protein) are indicated by\nbold letters.\n\n## In Vitro Receptor-Binding Assay\n\nThe in vitro nAChR\nbinding assay was performed based on the methods described by Maloney\net al. 35  The methods were adapted to our\nfacilities and to the use of non-radioactively labeled thiacloprid\n( Figure  2 ). The receptor-binding\nassay was prepared by combining 0.27 mg of MP (0.5 mL of MP extract)\nand 6 mL of Tris–HCl buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4) spiked with thiacloprid\nin 8 mL ultracentrifuge vials. Final concentrations of thiacloprid\nin the vials corresponded to 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 25, and 50 nM. Each concentration\nwas tested in four technical replicates split over multiple runs of\nthe assay (8 vials each). After incubation for 2 h at 23 °C and\n100 rpm, samples were ultracentrifuged (43,000 g ,\n30 min, 4 °C). The incubation medium was sampled by combining\n500 μL of the supernatant with 400 μL of MeOH and 100\nμL of ISTD. The rest of the supernatant was removed, the pellet\nwas resuspended in 6.5 mL of Tris–HCl, and the suspension was\nultracentrifuged again. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed,\nand the pellet was extracted for thiacloprid concentration, as described\nfor gammarid tissue extractions. Each assay included a protein recovery\ncontrol in order to correct the measured receptor-bound amount of\nthiacloprid for the MP lost during the extraction steps.\n\n## Chemical Analysis\n\nAll collected samples were stored\nat −20 °C until chemical analysis. Chemical analysis was\nperformed using an automated online solid phase extraction system\ncoupled with reversed phase (C18 column, Atlantis T3, 5 μm,\n3 × 150 mm) liquid chromatography and high-resolution tandem\nmass spectrometry (online-SPE-LC-HRMS/MS) using the Orbitrap technology\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Ionization was performed using an\nelectrospray ionization interface. Specifications on the used mass\nspectrometers and the parameter settings are provided in  Supporting Information  A6.\n\nThiacloprid\nwas quantified in positive mode with the internal standard using TraceFinder\n5.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) for peak integration. Additionally,\na suspect screening using commonly known transformation products of\nthiacloprid was performed. Detailed information on quality control\nand quantification is provided in  Supporting Information  A7.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nTotal tissue bioconcentration factors\n(BCF SS,total  in L kg –1 ) under steady-state\nconditions were calculated for the toxicokinetic experiments II and\nIII as the ratio of measured total tissue concentration at the end\nof the uptake phase ( C tissue,u ) and the\naverage measured exposure concentration ( C water ) 1\n\nAdditionally, corresponding BCFs of\nthe structure (further defined in the following section,  Figure  3 ) compartment (BCF SS,structure  in L kg –1 ) for the concentration-dependent\ntoxicokinetic experiment were determined by subtracting the elimination-resistant\nfraction at the end of the elimination phase ( C tissue,e ) from the concentration at the end of the uptake phase 2\n\nIllustration of the toxicokinetic-receptor model\nbased on  eqs  5  and  6 . The volume of the water basin is assumed to be\ninfinite compared\nto the volume of exposed gammarids. The weight ratio of the membrane\nprotein (MP) and the structure compartment is defined as FMS (MP content,\nhere 1%). Elimination from the MP compartment was set to zero ( k off  = 0) because no elimination could be determined\nduring the toxicokinetic experiments and model development.\n\nReceptor-binding properties of thiacloprid were\nmodeled from the\nin vitro assay by determining the maximal irreversible binding parameter  B max  (μmol kg MP –1 ) and the equilibrium dissociation constant  K d  (nM).  B max  is indicative of the\nmaximum number of nAChR binding sites. Correspondingly, it is also\na measure of the nAChR density of an organism if each receptor contains\none specific binding site for thiacloprid. The equilibrium dissociation\nconstant  K d  represents the binding affinity\nof thiacloprid to nAChRs and is defined as the ligand concentration\nto achieve a half-maximum binding at equilibrium. 36\n\nThe specific binding ( C specific , μmol\nkg MP –1 ) model accounted for one-site,\nspecific binding under equilibrium conditions 3 where  C free  (nM)\nis the concentration in the in vitro receptor-binding assay medium.\nThe model was applied to the assay medium concentrations of 0 to 25\nnM because unspecific binding at these concentrations was negligible\ncompared to specific binding. Receptor-binding was modeled in GraphPad\nPrism 9.4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The modeled receptor-binding\nparameters were additionally confirmed using an unspecific binding\nmodel with an extended set of medium concentrations ( Supporting Information  A8).\n\nStatistical analysis and\ndata visualization were performed using\nGraphPad Prism 9.4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Significant differences\nbetween categorical variables were tested by ANOVA if not stated otherwise.\nThe level of significance was set to 0.05. Normal distribution and\nhomoscedasticity of the residuals were assumed. The law of error propagation\nwas applied to all calculations. 37\n\n## Toxicokinetic Modeling\n\nA toxicokinetic model, including\nreceptor-binding (toxicokinetic-receptor model), was developed to\ndescribe the observed toxicokinetics of thiacloprid in  G. pulex . Receptor models describing the kinetics\nof ligand–receptor complexes have been previously described\nfor other organisms 38 , 39  and discussed in the context\nof toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic models. 40  Irreversible binding of thiacloprid to the nAChR was the core assumption\nof our model. Specifically, we assumed a two-compartment model with\na structure (S) and a MP compartment incorporated into the structure\ncompartment ( Figure  3 ). While there is a bidirectional exchange between the structure\ncompartment of the organism and the environment (i.e., water), the\ninteraction of the structure compartment with the MP compartment is\nunidirectional due to irreversible receptor binding ( k off  = 0). There is no direct interaction between water\nand the MP compartment. The model assumptions and reasoning are described\nin further detail in  Supporting Information  A9.\n\nThe formation of the ligand–receptor complex and\nits dissociation can be described through an ordinary differential\nequation. The change of the concentration of ligand-bound receptors,\nhere approximated as the change of the thiacloprid concentration in\nthe MP compartment  C MP  (μmol kg MP –1 ) over time  t  (d), depends\non the ligand (thiacloprid) concentration in the structure compartment  C structure  (μmol kg structure –1 ) and the concentration of free receptors  N R  (μmol kg MP –1 ) multiplied with the second-order rate  k on  (kg structure  μmol –1  d –1 ). The first order rate  k off  (d –1 ) determines the dissociation of the complex, depending on the concentration\nof ligand-bound receptors. 4\n\nOur experimental results indicated\nan irreversible binding of thiacloprid\nat the temporal scale of the experiments. Furthermore, no parameter\nvalue for  k off  significantly different\nfrom zero could be determined. Thus, the dissociation rate  k off  was set to zero. With these observations,\nthe assumption that the total number of receptors  N R0  (μmol kg MP –1 ) is\nequal to the sum of ligand-bound receptors ( N RL ) and free receptors ( N R  =  N R0  –  N RL ),\nand further approximating  N R0  as the maximal\nbinding capacity  B max  (μmol kg MP –1 ),  eq  4  can be rearranged as follows 5\n\nThe concentration in the structure\ncompartment  C structure  can be determined\nusing the following ordinary\ndifferential equation 6 where  k u  (L kg structure –1  d –1 ) is the\nuptake rate,  C W  (μM) is the water\nconcentration of the exposure medium,  k e  (d –1 ) is the elimination rate, and FMS (0.01 kg MP  kg structure –1 ) is the factor\nto correct the proportion of MP compared to the structure compartment.\n\nThe total tissue concentration  C total  (μmol kg –1 ) can be approximated as 7\n\nThe modeled kinetic bioconcentration\nfactor (BCF kin,structure  in L kg –1 ) in\nthe structure compartment was determined\nas the ratio of  k u  and  k e 8\n\nThe internal concentrations derived\nfrom the toxicokinetic experiments\nwere used to calibrate and validate the toxicokinetic-receptor model\n( eqs  5 – 7 ). Model calibration was done with data of constant\nexposures (0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, and 1500 μg L –1 ). The parameter space explorer 41  was\nused for the optimization of the model parameter and to produce the\nconfidence intervals of the model curves. The resulting best-fit model\nparameters were subsequently used to simulate model predictions. To\nvalidate this approach, the predictions were compared with both constant\n(5, 50, 500, and 5000 μg L –1 ) and pulsed (5\nand 50 μg L –1 ) exposure scenarios. All calculations\nwere performed in MATLAB 2021b using the Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)\nmodeling platform ( https://www.debtox.info/byom.html , version 6.2). Model scripts are provided on GitHub ( https://github.com/NikaGoldring/TK-receptor ).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe determined lipid contents\n(wet weight basis, mean ± SD,  n  = 3) were 0.7\n± 0.2% (toxicokinetic experiments, sampled in October and November)\nand 0.4 ± 0.2% (gammarids used for in vivo and in vitro receptor-binding\nassay, sampled in January). Lipid contents were in a similar range\nto that observed elsewhere. 32 , 42  The observed decrease\nin lipid content from fall to winter may be due to the use of energy\nreserves, such as storage lipids. 42  No\nlipid normalization of accumulated thiacloprid was performed, as lipid\ncontent was demonstrated to have no significant influence on the bioconcentration\nof polar organic contaminants in amphipods. 32\n\nThe total protein content (wet weight basis) across the experiments\nranged from 4.4 to 5.0% and is within the range reported for other\ngammarid populations. 42  The average MP\ncontent was 1.0 ± 0.1%, which is higher than that reported for\nother aquatic invertebrates and methods. 35\n\nThe measured medium concentrations\nof all performed toxicokinetic experiments were within 20% of the\nnominal concentrations ( Supporting Information  B), which is in line with the OECD 305 requirements. 25  Concentrations of the elimination medium were\nbelow the limit of quantification (generally 0.01 μg L –1 , but 0.001 for the low exposure concentrations of 0.5 and 0.05 μg\nL –1 ), confirming a neglectable impact for reuptake\nfrom the medium, except for minor residues after exposure with concentrations\n≥500 μg L –1 . Relative O 2  saturation (>85%), pH (7.9 ± 0.1) and water temperatures\nwere\nstable (15.5 ± 1 °C) during the experiments.\n\nThe\ninternal concentrations of gammarids exposed to different concentrations\nof thiacloprid (0.5–5000 μg L –1 ) increased\nsignificantly along the concentration gradient from an average of\n0.23 ± 0.03 to 39 ± 4 μmol kg –1  at\nthe end of the uptake phase ( Figure  4 ). An approximation of steady state conditions was\nassumed based on the visually observed saturation in the kinetic experiments\n(i.e., pulsed exposure for ≥5 μg L –1 ) or kinetic measurements (0.5 μg L –1 ). The\ndifference in internal concentration between the lowest and the highest\nconcentration was only a factor of 150, despite a 10,000-fold difference\nin exposure concentration. The developed toxicokinetic model ( Table  3 ) demonstrated that\nsteady-state conditions would be reached within the exposure time\nwindow for all applied exposure concentrations except for 0.05 μg\nL –1 . At the end of the elimination phase, no significant\ndifference between remaining tissue concentrations was observed (0.18\n± 0.04 to 0.39 ± 0.13 μmol kg –1 ).\nFurthermore, no statistical difference between tissue concentrations\nat the end of the exposure and elimination phases was observed for\nconcentrations equal to or lower than 5 μg L –1 . Thus, the present data indicate a concentration dependence of the\nwhole-body bioconcentration of thiacloprid in  G. pulex  due to a saturation of the second, elimination-resistant MP compartment.\n\nInternal\nconcentrations (left) of thiacloprid at the end of the\nuptake and elimination phases at different exposure concentrations.\nCalculated uncorrected  BCF SS,total  and\nthe  BCF SS,structure  (right). Data are\npresented as individual data points and mean ± SD ( n  = 3). Letters indicate significant differences between the groups\n(two-way ANOVA,  p  < 0.05, log transformation,\nTukey’s post-hoc test). For 0.05 μg L –1  (m), data were modeled using the toxicokinetic-receptor model because\nno steady state was reached during this experiment (20 days).\n\nIn order to account for the two-compartment bioconcentration\nkinetics,\ntwo different BCFs were calculated ( Figure  4 ). The BCF SS,total  was calculated\nfrom the tissue and medium concentration at the end of the uptake\nphase ( eq  1 ), representing\nthe whole body concentration. It showed a clear concentration dependence,\nranging from 1.9 ± 0.2 L kg –1  at the highest\nexposure concentration toward a 60 times higher value (109 ±\n14 L kg –1 ) at the lowest exposure concentration\nthat reached a steady state (0.5 μg L –1 ).\nThe BCF SS,structure , calculated by subtracting the elimination-resistant\nfraction from the total tissue concentration ( eq  2 ), resulted in much more similar BCFs (2.5\n± 0.8 L kg –1 ), which were also in the range\nof the modeled BCF kin,structure  (2.0 L kg –1 ,  eq  8 ) of the structure\ncompartment. The difference between the BCF SS,total  and\nBCF SS,structure  was not significantly different for the\nhigh exposure concentrations (500 to 5000 μg L –1 ) due to the small relative contribution of the MP compartment to\nthe whole body concentration.\n\nAll calculated\nBCF SS,total  in the present study were\nbelow the B criterion (BCF ≥ 2000 L kg –1 ) 25  threshold and in range of those reported for\nneonicotinoids in  G. pulex  and other\naquatic species (0.2–70). 20 , 28 , 43 , 44  However, considering\nthe increasing BCF SS,total  with decreasing exposure concentration—caused\nby the saturation of the MP compartment—the BCF of thiacloprid\nwould continue to increase at lower, field-relevant concentrations.\nFor instance, at concentrations below 30 ng L –1 ,\nthe BCF SS,total  could increase above the regulatory threshold\n(BCF ≥ 2000 L kg –1 ) and at ≤12 ng\nL –1  above the very bioaccumulative criterion (BCF\n≥ 5000 L kg –1 ), given a long enough exposure\ntime. Measured neonicotinoid concentrations in surface waters are\ntypically in this ng L –1  range. 5 , 16 , 22  Thus, the concentration dependence of neonicotinoid\naccumulation would also explain the much higher accumulation of neonicotinoids\nobserved in the field compared to laboratory studies. 22\n\nPrevious investigations that determined internal\nconcentrations\nof neonicotinoids in crustaceans 20  may\nnot have observed such two-compartment kinetics because of very high\n(mg L –1  range) exposure concentrations masking the\nelimination-resistant fraction (e.g., 5000 μg L –1 ,  Figure  4 ). These\nhigh-exposure concentrations were applied due to the low acute toxicity\nof neonicotinoids toward crustaceans but probably also to guarantee\na proper quantification of the compound in tissue samples. The methods\napplied in the present study facilitated the determination of medium\nand tissue concentrations of exposure experiments down to the ng L –1  range and allowed the detection of the elimination-resistant\nthiacloprid amount. Thus, testing bioconcentration at lower exposure\nconcentrations may improve the detection and understanding of discrepancies\nbetween laboratory and field experiments. 22\n\nThe measured tissue concentrations\nin gammarids exposed to three consecutive pulses of thiacloprid are\nshown in  Figure  5 .\nIn the 50 μg L –1  exposure treatment, all internal\nconcentrations were, on average, three times higher during the uptake\nphase after 1 and 2 days (0.76 ± 0.04 μmol kg –1 ) than during the elimination phase (0.23 ± 0.03 μmol\nkg –1 ). A similar pattern but lower internal concentrations\nat the end of the uptake phases were observed in the 5 μg L –1  treatment ( Supporting Information  A11). The measured internal concentrations, including the elimination-resistant\nfraction after 1 and 3 days of elimination, were similar to the concentrations\nmeasured in the concentration-dependent toxicokinetic experiments.\nThus, the pulsed exposure experiment supported the observed elimination\nresistance of the MP compartment. Furthermore, it was demonstrated\nthat the non-eliminating residues reached the maximum binding capacity\nalready after the first exposure pulse and remained unchanged afterward.\nThese results may help in interpreting toxic effects observed in pulsed\nexposure scenarios elsewhere. 19 , 45\n\nInternal thiacloprid\nconcentrations in  G. pulex  sampled\nduring the pulsed exposure experiment at 50 μg L –1 . Lines represent the average (±SD,  n  = 18)\ntissue concentration determined in gammarids sampled during\nthe uptake phase (gray) and elimination phase (orange). Significant\ndifferences within each exposure pulse concentration are indicated\nby letters (two-way ANOVA,  p  < 0.05, Tukey’s\npost-hoc test).\n\nThe amount of thiacloprid recovered\nin the in vivo receptor-binding assay matched the concentrations of\nthe conventionally extracted (whole body burden) samples of both the\nexposure and elimination phases ( Figure  6 ). After the uptake phase, most thiacloprid\nwas recovered in the supernatant (64%), followed by MPs (19%) and\ndebris (16%). Thiacloprid associated with different fractions may\nbe interpreted as follows: (1) supernatant = free thiacloprid (i.e.,\nstructure compartment) or thiacloprid detached from MPs or associated\nwith MPs that were not separated during ultracentrifugation, (2) debris\n= thiacloprid that was not extracted by the DM (i.e., incomplete MP\nextraction, association with the exoskeleton, incorporation into un-lysed\ntissue), and (3) membrane protein = thiacloprid associated with membrane\nproteins such as the nAChRs. Binding or sorption to the exoskeleton\n(i.e., debris fraction, exuviae analysis  Supporting Information  A4) seemed to be of low importance for thiacloprid\nbody burdens, other than what was suggested for other chemicals in\ncrustaceans in earlier reports. 20 , 22\n\nThiacloprid concentrations\nrecovered in different fractions of\nthe in vivo nAChR binding assay presented as stacked bar plots. The\ngray line indicates the concentration determined from the unfractionated\nextract (lower line = elimination, upper line = uptake). Data are\npresented as mean ± SD ( n  = 6). Significant\ndecreases from the end of uptake to the end of the elimination phase\nare indicated by asterisks (n.s. =  p  ≥ 0.05,\n** =  p  < 0.01, *** =  p  < 0.001;\ntwo-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post-hoc test).\n\nThe amount of thiacloprid in the supernatant and\nthe debris decreased\nsignificantly by more than 90 and 60%, respectively, during the elimination\nphase. In contrast, thiacloprid concentrations in MP remained constant\nfrom the exposure to the elimination phase. At the end of the elimination\nphase, thiacloprid associated with MP accounted for the largest amount\n(61%) of the total body burden. The in vivo receptor-binding assay\nindicated that the elimination-resistant fraction of thiacloprid in  G. pulex  may be caused by irreversible binding to\nparts of the MPs, such as the nAChRs.\n\nParameters from the one-site specific binding model\n( R 2  = 0.83,  Supporting Information  A8) of the in vitro ligand binding assay are presented\nin  Table  2 . Similar\nparameters\nwere estimated with the unspecific binding model ( B max  = 5.5 and  K d  = 0.41,  Supporting Information  A8). While the CI of  B max  was narrow (<15%),  K d  was estimated with considerable uncertainty due to the\ninsufficient coverage of the binding isotherm in the proximate region\nof  K d  (Scatchard plot). However, even\nin previous studies covering lower exposure concentrations and with\na more sensitive radio-labeled method, similar confidence intervals\nwere obtained. 35  An extrapolation of  B max  to the whole organism ( C B max ), correcting for MP recovery\nafter the in vitro assay (24%) and MP content (1%) resulted in a whole-body\nconcentration of 0.24 μmol kg –1 . Such concentration\nis in a similar range to the elimination-resistant fraction determined\nin the toxicokinetic experiments, including the estimated  C B max  of the toxicokinetic-receptor\nmodel ( Table  3 ) and an in vivo binding assay. Thus, the\nutilization of in vivo and in vitro receptor-binding assays seemed\nto be sufficient to upscale receptor-binding processes to the whole\norganism level, which provides potential for novel toxicokinetic research\napproaches.\n\nParameters are presented with the\ncorresponding 95% CIs (confidence intervals).  R 2  = 0.83.  C B max  = maximal nAChR-bound thiacloprid extrapolated to the whole\nbody of  G. pulex  predicted using the\nMP content FMS (1%) and the MP recovery rate of 24% throughout the\nin vitro assay.  C B max  is equal to the receptor density in the whole organism, assuming\none binding site per receptor.\n\nC B max  = Maximal nAChR-bound thiacloprid amount extrapolated\nto the whole body of G. pulex using the\nmembrane protein content FMS (1%).\n\nBoundary of the parameter space\nexplorer.\n\nThe  B max  values obtained\nfrom the in\nvivo receptor-binding assay may be compared to existing studies with\nimidacloprid, as both imidacloprid and thiacloprid were suggested\nto bind to the same nAChR-binding site (one of five subunits) in cockroach\nneurons. 46  Therefore, the  B max  values of the two neonicotinoids may also be indicative\nfor the receptor densities in different arthropod species. Maloney\net al. 35  reported  B max  values for imidacloprid in 13 invertebrate species ranging\nfrom 51 × 10 –6  to 6.5 μmol kg MP –1 . The  B max  for thiacloprid\nin  G. pulex  was closest to the values\nreported for imidacloprid in  Chironomus riparius  and  C. dilutus  larvae. 35  Since nAChRs are not only located in the peripheral\nand the central nervous systems but also in muscular tissues, 47  the high binding capacity in both organism types\nmay result from a high proportion of muscular tissue ( Supporting Information  A12). A compartmentation\nof the neonicotinoid imidacloprid into the nervous system and muscle\ntissue was also indicated in a radio-imaging study on gammarids. 148  Furthermore, it should be noted that similar\nmolar concentrations of imidacloprid at the end of the elimination\nphase from toxicokinetic experiments with two other  G. pulex  populations 31 , 48  were comparable\nto the observations for thiacloprid in the present study. These findings\nsupport the suggested similar nAChR-binding capabilities of the two\nneonicotinoids in gammarids.\n\nThe methods from Maloney et al. 35  using\nradiolabeled imidacloprid could be sufficiently adapted to less specialized\nlaboratory equipment and the measurement of unlabeled ligands. However,\nthe adaptation resulted in several drawbacks, such as the need for\nlarger sample volumes and time-consuming ultracentrifugation. Possible\noptimizations, such as the reduction of the assay to a microplate\nlayout to reduce centrifugation steps and losses, are discussed in  Supporting Information  A13.\n\nThe thiacloprid concentrations\nin  G. pulex  tissue ( Figure  7 ) showed a steady increase\nduring the exposure phase of the kinetic experiments. The increase\nin tissue concentrations was slowing down considerably between days\n1 and 2 at exposure concentrations ≥5 μg L –1 . During the first day of the elimination phase, thiacloprid was\nrapidly removed from the structure compartment, but no elimination\noccurred from the MP compartment, which determines the remaining total\ntissue concentration. This behavior is consistent with the observations\nof the receptor-binding assays.\n\nTotal thiacloprid tissue concentrations\n(A,D), structure compartment\n(B,E), and MP compartment (C,F) concentrations presented as measured\nvalues (dots) and toxicokinetic-receptor model fits (lines) from the\nmodel calibration. Colored dotted lines represent the 95% CIs. Gray\ndotted lines indicate the change from the uptake to the elimination\nphase. Please note the different  y -axis scales. The\npresented MP concentration is up-scaled to the total tissue concentration\nto allow a better comparison. Underlying model parameters are provided\nin  Table  2 . The complete\ndataset is plotted in  Figure S6 .\n\nThe determined model parameters are provided in  Table  3 . The calibrated best-fit\nmodel\nparameter resulted in an overall  R 2  of\n0.99 in describing the measured total internal concentration of thiacloprid\nin  G. pulex . The quality of the fit\nby visual examination was deemed satisfactory ( Figures  7  and  S6 ). The\nprofile likelihoods ( Figure S7 , plots on\nthe diagonal) of  k u ,  k e , and  B max  were well defined\n(i.e., u-shaped and crossing the critical value on both ends).  k on  could not be identified, as this process\nseemed to be much faster than  k u  and the\ntime resolution of the observations. Therefore, the optimization algorithm\nhit the arbitrarily set upper limit for this parameter. Thus, the\nassociation process might be seen as instantaneous, given the available\ndataset. The likelihood-based joint-confidence regions ( Figure S7 , scatter plots) showed a strong correlation\nof the model parameters  k u  and  k e , expressed in their narrow-shaped ellipse.\nThe calibrated model showed high accuracy in predicting the measured\nconcentrations of the validation datasets for both constant ( Figure S8 ) and pulsed exposure scenarios ( Figure S9 ). Physiological inactivity of gammarids\n( Supporting Information  A11) had a noticeable\nimpact by reducing toxicokinetic rates but only minor effects on  B max  and  BCF kin,structure .\n\nOne assumption of the developed model was irreversible binding,\nwhich resulted in a fixed value of zero for  k off . No elimination of thiacloprid during the present experiments\ncould be observed by statistical or modeling means. However, this\nassumption may not hold true for much longer experimental times. For\ninstance, a recovery time of 45 days was determined by toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic\n(TK–TD) modeling for imidacloprid-exposed daphnids, 20  but no recovery was identified for gammarids\nin a different study. 48  In competition-binding\nassays, it was demonstrated that the binding affinity of neonicotinoids\nis much higher than that of acetylcholine, but neonicotinoids may\nstill be removed if acetylcholine is available in large excess. 49  This mechanism may eventually result in a slow\nrecovery of affected nAChRs. Furthermore, organisms may recover by\ndeconstructing affected receptors and generating new receptors dynamically.\nThese mechanisms may also lead to lower  B max  values at very low exposure concentrations (≪ 0.5 μg\nL –1 ), which take a considerably longer time to reach\nthe maximal  C MP  concentration.\n\nThe\ndeveloped model assumed well-mixed compartments as a simplification.\nHowever, this might not be appropriate for the representation of receptors\nin different organs. It is known that different nAChRs of various\norgan types (i.e., muscles and nervous system) are built from different\nsubunits. 50  The proportion of these receptor/subunit\ntypes may change across species, seasons, and developmental states,\nthus affecting the suitability of the applied MP content normalization.\nFurthermore, this may limit the extrapolation of the total nAChR density\nbased on receptor-bound neonicotinoids.\n\nThe profile likelihood\nanalysis revealed an identification problem\nwith the parameter  k on , whose upper boundary\ncould not be distinguished from infinity ( Figure S7 , plots on the diagonal). This problem can be associated\nwith so-called “fast kinetics” extensively discussed\nby experts before. 51  That is, when fast\nkinetics are observed, the steady-state is reached before the first\nmeasurement. In the present study, this was the case for the receptor-bound\nfraction because no independent kinetic measurements of the receptor-bound\nfraction were feasible. Thus, the data do not hold the exact information\nabout how quickly a steady state between the structure and the MP\ncompartment is achieved. To minimize the effect of this parameter\nand avoid numerical problems on the joint-confidence regions, the\nfixed boundary of the parameter space explorer (i.e., 200) was used\nas an upper boundary of  k on . Consequently,\nalso the assumption of instantaneous binding could be another way\nof simplifying the present model. The described observation is in\nline with the high receptor affinity of thiacloprid to nAChRs, indicating\nthat the speed of in vivo receptor-binding kinetics are limited by\nthe initial uptake of thiacloprid into the structure compartment.\n\nBiotransformation of thiacloprid in amphipods was neither reported\nin the literature nor found in a screening for reported biotransformation\nproducts (e.g., thiacloprid amide) in bacteria 52  ( Supporting Information  A7).\nThus, in order to also display toxicokinetics of neonicotinoids or\nother receptor-bound compounds that are biotransformed in amphipods\n(e.g. imidacloprid 43 , 53 ), the presented model may be\nextended by considering biotransformation. However, further research\nwould be needed in order to understand and implement the exact mechanisms\nof biotransformation, such as compartment-dependent biotransformation\nand binding of biotransformation products to the nAChRs.\n\nIn the present study,\nwe demonstrated that irreversible binding to MPs such as the nAChRs\nexplains the observed elimination resistance 22 , 31 , 32  of neonicotinoids from amphipod tissue.\nConsequently, this elimination-resistant fraction may explain the\ndelayed toxic effects and irreversible damages toward aquatic arthropods\nthat were previously reported. 17 , 18 , 45 , 53  In fact, the MP-associated fraction\nmay be interpreted as either irreversible damage to the nAChR or continuous\nexposure due to elimination resistance, depending on the point of\nview. The here-provided mechanistic insights may help to improve the\nunderstanding of toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics, and adverse outcome\npathways of neonicotinoids in arthropods. Such considerations may\nbe important for the risk assessment of neonicotinoids, as well as\ntheir replacement candidates (i.e., flupyradifurone 9 ) and other contaminants with (irreversible) receptor-binding\nproperties. Furthermore, existing TK–TD modeling approaches 19 , 48 , 53 , 54  may be updated based on the present findings.\n\nThe standard\nbioaccumulation assessment, according to OECD 305 25  using fish, generally assumes one-compartment kinetics,\nan independence of bioaccumulation parameters from exposure concentrations\nand a relevance of bioaccumulation only for compounds with high log  K OW  values. However, our toxicokinetic investigations\non neonicotinoids in aquatic invertebrates demonstrated a strong exposure\nconcentration dependence due to a maximum binding capacity and no\nelimination from the MP compartment. These mechanisms may result in\nBCFs above the threshold value for the B criterion (2000) at concentrations\ntypically observed in the environment (ng L –1  range). 5 , 16  In contrast to multi-compartment kinetics caused by sorption to\nexoskeleton/cuticula of aquatic invertebrates, 55  the here-reported second compartment consists of a bioactive,\nand thus toxicologically relevant, fraction. Similar mechanisms for\nelimination-resistant bioactive fractions may exist for other compound\nclasses with observed multi-compartment kinetics, such as strobilurins\nin amphipods. 26 , 32  However, further research is\nneeded to understand the underlying mechanisms and their toxicological\nrelevance. In order to account for concentration-dependent bioaccumulation,\na category such as “elimination-resistant” or “receptor-bound”\nmay be important for establishing new testing guidelines, i.e., for\nthe proposed bioaccumulation studies using arthropods. 27 , 56  With our developed toxicokinetic-receptor model, we provide the\nrequired modeling platform for such implementations.\n\nFurthermore,\nthe usefulness of environmental threshold concentrations\nfor elimination-resistant compounds such as neonicotinoids may be\nreconsidered. 16  Exposed organisms may accumulate\nneonicotinoids over their lifetime and eventually reach saturation\nof the nAChRs, regardless of the exposure concentration. Additionally,\nthis resistance toward elimination may explain trophic magnification\nin arthropods and transfer from aquatic to terrestrial food webs observed\nfor neonicotinoids elsewhere. 57  Furthermore,\nenvironmental parameters may have an impact on the toxicokinetics\nof neonicotinoids. For instance, temperature was demonstrated to exert\nan exponential relationship with uptake and elimination rates in amphipods. 32  This may result in much faster saturation of\nthe nAChRs, especially if high water concentrations co-occur with\nhigher temperatures, such as during a run-off event in the summer,\nand consequently enhance the exposure risks toward aquatic arthropods.\nHowever, further investigations of the interaction of temperature\nand neonicotinoid exposure are needed to evaluate this risk.\n\n## Lipid and Protein Contents\n\nThe determined lipid contents\n(wet weight basis, mean ± SD,  n  = 3) were 0.7\n± 0.2% (toxicokinetic experiments, sampled in October and November)\nand 0.4 ± 0.2% (gammarids used for in vivo and in vitro receptor-binding\nassay, sampled in January). Lipid contents were in a similar range\nto that observed elsewhere. 32 , 42  The observed decrease\nin lipid content from fall to winter may be due to the use of energy\nreserves, such as storage lipids. 42  No\nlipid normalization of accumulated thiacloprid was performed, as lipid\ncontent was demonstrated to have no significant influence on the bioconcentration\nof polar organic contaminants in amphipods. 32\n\nThe total protein content (wet weight basis) across the experiments\nranged from 4.4 to 5.0% and is within the range reported for other\ngammarid populations. 42  The average MP\ncontent was 1.0 ± 0.1%, which is higher than that reported for\nother aquatic invertebrates and methods. 35\n\n## Exposure Medium\n\nThe measured medium concentrations\nof all performed toxicokinetic experiments were within 20% of the\nnominal concentrations ( Supporting Information  B), which is in line with the OECD 305 requirements. 25  Concentrations of the elimination medium were\nbelow the limit of quantification (generally 0.01 μg L –1 , but 0.001 for the low exposure concentrations of 0.5 and 0.05 μg\nL –1 ), confirming a neglectable impact for reuptake\nfrom the medium, except for minor residues after exposure with concentrations\n≥500 μg L –1 . Relative O 2  saturation (>85%), pH (7.9 ± 0.1) and water temperatures\nwere\nstable (15.5 ± 1 °C) during the experiments.\n\n## Exposure Concentration-Dependent Toxicokinetics\n\nThe\ninternal concentrations of gammarids exposed to different concentrations\nof thiacloprid (0.5–5000 μg L –1 ) increased\nsignificantly along the concentration gradient from an average of\n0.23 ± 0.03 to 39 ± 4 μmol kg –1  at\nthe end of the uptake phase ( Figure  4 ). An approximation of steady state conditions was\nassumed based on the visually observed saturation in the kinetic experiments\n(i.e., pulsed exposure for ≥5 μg L –1 ) or kinetic measurements (0.5 μg L –1 ). The\ndifference in internal concentration between the lowest and the highest\nconcentration was only a factor of 150, despite a 10,000-fold difference\nin exposure concentration. The developed toxicokinetic model ( Table  3 ) demonstrated that\nsteady-state conditions would be reached within the exposure time\nwindow for all applied exposure concentrations except for 0.05 μg\nL –1 . At the end of the elimination phase, no significant\ndifference between remaining tissue concentrations was observed (0.18\n± 0.04 to 0.39 ± 0.13 μmol kg –1 ).\nFurthermore, no statistical difference between tissue concentrations\nat the end of the exposure and elimination phases was observed for\nconcentrations equal to or lower than 5 μg L –1 . Thus, the present data indicate a concentration dependence of the\nwhole-body bioconcentration of thiacloprid in  G. pulex  due to a saturation of the second, elimination-resistant MP compartment.\n\nInternal\nconcentrations (left) of thiacloprid at the end of the\nuptake and elimination phases at different exposure concentrations.\nCalculated uncorrected  BCF SS,total  and\nthe  BCF SS,structure  (right). Data are\npresented as individual data points and mean ± SD ( n  = 3). Letters indicate significant differences between the groups\n(two-way ANOVA,  p  < 0.05, log transformation,\nTukey’s post-hoc test). For 0.05 μg L –1  (m), data were modeled using the toxicokinetic-receptor model because\nno steady state was reached during this experiment (20 days).\n\nIn order to account for the two-compartment bioconcentration\nkinetics,\ntwo different BCFs were calculated ( Figure  4 ). The BCF SS,total  was calculated\nfrom the tissue and medium concentration at the end of the uptake\nphase ( eq  1 ), representing\nthe whole body concentration. It showed a clear concentration dependence,\nranging from 1.9 ± 0.2 L kg –1  at the highest\nexposure concentration toward a 60 times higher value (109 ±\n14 L kg –1 ) at the lowest exposure concentration\nthat reached a steady state (0.5 μg L –1 ).\nThe BCF SS,structure , calculated by subtracting the elimination-resistant\nfraction from the total tissue concentration ( eq  2 ), resulted in much more similar BCFs (2.5\n± 0.8 L kg –1 ), which were also in the range\nof the modeled BCF kin,structure  (2.0 L kg –1 ,  eq  8 ) of the structure\ncompartment. The difference between the BCF SS,total  and\nBCF SS,structure  was not significantly different for the\nhigh exposure concentrations (500 to 5000 μg L –1 ) due to the small relative contribution of the MP compartment to\nthe whole body concentration.\n\nAll calculated\nBCF SS,total  in the present study were\nbelow the B criterion (BCF ≥ 2000 L kg –1 ) 25  threshold and in range of those reported for\nneonicotinoids in  G. pulex  and other\naquatic species (0.2–70). 20 , 28 , 43 , 44  However, considering\nthe increasing BCF SS,total  with decreasing exposure concentration—caused\nby the saturation of the MP compartment—the BCF of thiacloprid\nwould continue to increase at lower, field-relevant concentrations.\nFor instance, at concentrations below 30 ng L –1 ,\nthe BCF SS,total  could increase above the regulatory threshold\n(BCF ≥ 2000 L kg –1 ) and at ≤12 ng\nL –1  above the very bioaccumulative criterion (BCF\n≥ 5000 L kg –1 ), given a long enough exposure\ntime. Measured neonicotinoid concentrations in surface waters are\ntypically in this ng L –1  range. 5 , 16 , 22  Thus, the concentration dependence of neonicotinoid\naccumulation would also explain the much higher accumulation of neonicotinoids\nobserved in the field compared to laboratory studies. 22\n\nPrevious investigations that determined internal\nconcentrations\nof neonicotinoids in crustaceans 20  may\nnot have observed such two-compartment kinetics because of very high\n(mg L –1  range) exposure concentrations masking the\nelimination-resistant fraction (e.g., 5000 μg L –1 ,  Figure  4 ). These\nhigh-exposure concentrations were applied due to the low acute toxicity\nof neonicotinoids toward crustaceans but probably also to guarantee\na proper quantification of the compound in tissue samples. The methods\napplied in the present study facilitated the determination of medium\nand tissue concentrations of exposure experiments down to the ng L –1  range and allowed the detection of the elimination-resistant\nthiacloprid amount. Thus, testing bioconcentration at lower exposure\nconcentrations may improve the detection and understanding of discrepancies\nbetween laboratory and field experiments. 22\n\n## Pulsed Exposure\n\nThe measured tissue concentrations\nin gammarids exposed to three consecutive pulses of thiacloprid are\nshown in  Figure  5 .\nIn the 50 μg L –1  exposure treatment, all internal\nconcentrations were, on average, three times higher during the uptake\nphase after 1 and 2 days (0.76 ± 0.04 μmol kg –1 ) than during the elimination phase (0.23 ± 0.03 μmol\nkg –1 ). A similar pattern but lower internal concentrations\nat the end of the uptake phases were observed in the 5 μg L –1  treatment ( Supporting Information  A11). The measured internal concentrations, including the elimination-resistant\nfraction after 1 and 3 days of elimination, were similar to the concentrations\nmeasured in the concentration-dependent toxicokinetic experiments.\nThus, the pulsed exposure experiment supported the observed elimination\nresistance of the MP compartment. Furthermore, it was demonstrated\nthat the non-eliminating residues reached the maximum binding capacity\nalready after the first exposure pulse and remained unchanged afterward.\nThese results may help in interpreting toxic effects observed in pulsed\nexposure scenarios elsewhere. 19 , 45\n\nInternal thiacloprid\nconcentrations in  G. pulex  sampled\nduring the pulsed exposure experiment at 50 μg L –1 . Lines represent the average (±SD,  n  = 18)\ntissue concentration determined in gammarids sampled during\nthe uptake phase (gray) and elimination phase (orange). Significant\ndifferences within each exposure pulse concentration are indicated\nby letters (two-way ANOVA,  p  < 0.05, Tukey’s\npost-hoc test).\n\n## Receptor-Binding Assays\n\nThe amount of thiacloprid recovered\nin the in vivo receptor-binding assay matched the concentrations of\nthe conventionally extracted (whole body burden) samples of both the\nexposure and elimination phases ( Figure  6 ). After the uptake phase, most thiacloprid\nwas recovered in the supernatant (64%), followed by MPs (19%) and\ndebris (16%). Thiacloprid associated with different fractions may\nbe interpreted as follows: (1) supernatant = free thiacloprid (i.e.,\nstructure compartment) or thiacloprid detached from MPs or associated\nwith MPs that were not separated during ultracentrifugation, (2) debris\n= thiacloprid that was not extracted by the DM (i.e., incomplete MP\nextraction, association with the exoskeleton, incorporation into un-lysed\ntissue), and (3) membrane protein = thiacloprid associated with membrane\nproteins such as the nAChRs. Binding or sorption to the exoskeleton\n(i.e., debris fraction, exuviae analysis  Supporting Information  A4) seemed to be of low importance for thiacloprid\nbody burdens, other than what was suggested for other chemicals in\ncrustaceans in earlier reports. 20 , 22\n\nThiacloprid concentrations\nrecovered in different fractions of\nthe in vivo nAChR binding assay presented as stacked bar plots. The\ngray line indicates the concentration determined from the unfractionated\nextract (lower line = elimination, upper line = uptake). Data are\npresented as mean ± SD ( n  = 6). Significant\ndecreases from the end of uptake to the end of the elimination phase\nare indicated by asterisks (n.s. =  p  ≥ 0.05,\n** =  p  < 0.01, *** =  p  < 0.001;\ntwo-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post-hoc test).\n\nThe amount of thiacloprid in the supernatant and\nthe debris decreased\nsignificantly by more than 90 and 60%, respectively, during the elimination\nphase. In contrast, thiacloprid concentrations in MP remained constant\nfrom the exposure to the elimination phase. At the end of the elimination\nphase, thiacloprid associated with MP accounted for the largest amount\n(61%) of the total body burden. The in vivo receptor-binding assay\nindicated that the elimination-resistant fraction of thiacloprid in  G. pulex  may be caused by irreversible binding to\nparts of the MPs, such as the nAChRs.\n\nParameters from the one-site specific binding model\n( R 2  = 0.83,  Supporting Information  A8) of the in vitro ligand binding assay are presented\nin  Table  2 . Similar\nparameters\nwere estimated with the unspecific binding model ( B max  = 5.5 and  K d  = 0.41,  Supporting Information  A8). While the CI of  B max  was narrow (<15%),  K d  was estimated with considerable uncertainty due to the\ninsufficient coverage of the binding isotherm in the proximate region\nof  K d  (Scatchard plot). However, even\nin previous studies covering lower exposure concentrations and with\na more sensitive radio-labeled method, similar confidence intervals\nwere obtained. 35  An extrapolation of  B max  to the whole organism ( C B max ), correcting for MP recovery\nafter the in vitro assay (24%) and MP content (1%) resulted in a whole-body\nconcentration of 0.24 μmol kg –1 . Such concentration\nis in a similar range to the elimination-resistant fraction determined\nin the toxicokinetic experiments, including the estimated  C B max  of the toxicokinetic-receptor\nmodel ( Table  3 ) and an in vivo binding assay. Thus, the\nutilization of in vivo and in vitro receptor-binding assays seemed\nto be sufficient to upscale receptor-binding processes to the whole\norganism level, which provides potential for novel toxicokinetic research\napproaches.\n\nParameters are presented with the\ncorresponding 95% CIs (confidence intervals).  R 2  = 0.83.  C B max  = maximal nAChR-bound thiacloprid extrapolated to the whole\nbody of  G. pulex  predicted using the\nMP content FMS (1%) and the MP recovery rate of 24% throughout the\nin vitro assay.  C B max  is equal to the receptor density in the whole organism, assuming\none binding site per receptor.\n\nC B max  = Maximal nAChR-bound thiacloprid amount extrapolated\nto the whole body of G. pulex using the\nmembrane protein content FMS (1%).\n\nBoundary of the parameter space\nexplorer.\n\nThe  B max  values obtained\nfrom the in\nvivo receptor-binding assay may be compared to existing studies with\nimidacloprid, as both imidacloprid and thiacloprid were suggested\nto bind to the same nAChR-binding site (one of five subunits) in cockroach\nneurons. 46  Therefore, the  B max  values of the two neonicotinoids may also be indicative\nfor the receptor densities in different arthropod species. Maloney\net al. 35  reported  B max  values for imidacloprid in 13 invertebrate species ranging\nfrom 51 × 10 –6  to 6.5 μmol kg MP –1 . The  B max  for thiacloprid\nin  G. pulex  was closest to the values\nreported for imidacloprid in  Chironomus riparius  and  C. dilutus  larvae. 35  Since nAChRs are not only located in the peripheral\nand the central nervous systems but also in muscular tissues, 47  the high binding capacity in both organism types\nmay result from a high proportion of muscular tissue ( Supporting Information  A12). A compartmentation\nof the neonicotinoid imidacloprid into the nervous system and muscle\ntissue was also indicated in a radio-imaging study on gammarids. 148  Furthermore, it should be noted that similar\nmolar concentrations of imidacloprid at the end of the elimination\nphase from toxicokinetic experiments with two other  G. pulex  populations 31 , 48  were comparable\nto the observations for thiacloprid in the present study. These findings\nsupport the suggested similar nAChR-binding capabilities of the two\nneonicotinoids in gammarids.\n\nThe methods from Maloney et al. 35  using\nradiolabeled imidacloprid could be sufficiently adapted to less specialized\nlaboratory equipment and the measurement of unlabeled ligands. However,\nthe adaptation resulted in several drawbacks, such as the need for\nlarger sample volumes and time-consuming ultracentrifugation. Possible\noptimizations, such as the reduction of the assay to a microplate\nlayout to reduce centrifugation steps and losses, are discussed in  Supporting Information  A13.\n\n## Toxicokinetic-Receptor Model\n\nThe thiacloprid concentrations\nin  G. pulex  tissue ( Figure  7 ) showed a steady increase\nduring the exposure phase of the kinetic experiments. The increase\nin tissue concentrations was slowing down considerably between days\n1 and 2 at exposure concentrations ≥5 μg L –1 . During the first day of the elimination phase, thiacloprid was\nrapidly removed from the structure compartment, but no elimination\noccurred from the MP compartment, which determines the remaining total\ntissue concentration. This behavior is consistent with the observations\nof the receptor-binding assays.\n\nTotal thiacloprid tissue concentrations\n(A,D), structure compartment\n(B,E), and MP compartment (C,F) concentrations presented as measured\nvalues (dots) and toxicokinetic-receptor model fits (lines) from the\nmodel calibration. Colored dotted lines represent the 95% CIs. Gray\ndotted lines indicate the change from the uptake to the elimination\nphase. Please note the different  y -axis scales. The\npresented MP concentration is up-scaled to the total tissue concentration\nto allow a better comparison. Underlying model parameters are provided\nin  Table  2 . The complete\ndataset is plotted in  Figure S6 .\n\nThe determined model parameters are provided in  Table  3 . The calibrated best-fit\nmodel\nparameter resulted in an overall  R 2  of\n0.99 in describing the measured total internal concentration of thiacloprid\nin  G. pulex . The quality of the fit\nby visual examination was deemed satisfactory ( Figures  7  and  S6 ). The\nprofile likelihoods ( Figure S7 , plots on\nthe diagonal) of  k u ,  k e , and  B max  were well defined\n(i.e., u-shaped and crossing the critical value on both ends).  k on  could not be identified, as this process\nseemed to be much faster than  k u  and the\ntime resolution of the observations. Therefore, the optimization algorithm\nhit the arbitrarily set upper limit for this parameter. Thus, the\nassociation process might be seen as instantaneous, given the available\ndataset. The likelihood-based joint-confidence regions ( Figure S7 , scatter plots) showed a strong correlation\nof the model parameters  k u  and  k e , expressed in their narrow-shaped ellipse.\nThe calibrated model showed high accuracy in predicting the measured\nconcentrations of the validation datasets for both constant ( Figure S8 ) and pulsed exposure scenarios ( Figure S9 ). Physiological inactivity of gammarids\n( Supporting Information  A11) had a noticeable\nimpact by reducing toxicokinetic rates but only minor effects on  B max  and  BCF kin,structure .\n\nOne assumption of the developed model was irreversible binding,\nwhich resulted in a fixed value of zero for  k off . No elimination of thiacloprid during the present experiments\ncould be observed by statistical or modeling means. However, this\nassumption may not hold true for much longer experimental times. For\ninstance, a recovery time of 45 days was determined by toxicokinetic–toxicodynamic\n(TK–TD) modeling for imidacloprid-exposed daphnids, 20  but no recovery was identified for gammarids\nin a different study. 48  In competition-binding\nassays, it was demonstrated that the binding affinity of neonicotinoids\nis much higher than that of acetylcholine, but neonicotinoids may\nstill be removed if acetylcholine is available in large excess. 49  This mechanism may eventually result in a slow\nrecovery of affected nAChRs. Furthermore, organisms may recover by\ndeconstructing affected receptors and generating new receptors dynamically.\nThese mechanisms may also lead to lower  B max  values at very low exposure concentrations (≪ 0.5 μg\nL –1 ), which take a considerably longer time to reach\nthe maximal  C MP  concentration.\n\nThe\ndeveloped model assumed well-mixed compartments as a simplification.\nHowever, this might not be appropriate for the representation of receptors\nin different organs. It is known that different nAChRs of various\norgan types (i.e., muscles and nervous system) are built from different\nsubunits. 50  The proportion of these receptor/subunit\ntypes may change across species, seasons, and developmental states,\nthus affecting the suitability of the applied MP content normalization.\nFurthermore, this may limit the extrapolation of the total nAChR density\nbased on receptor-bound neonicotinoids.\n\nThe profile likelihood\nanalysis revealed an identification problem\nwith the parameter  k on , whose upper boundary\ncould not be distinguished from infinity ( Figure S7 , plots on the diagonal). This problem can be associated\nwith so-called “fast kinetics” extensively discussed\nby experts before. 51  That is, when fast\nkinetics are observed, the steady-state is reached before the first\nmeasurement. In the present study, this was the case for the receptor-bound\nfraction because no independent kinetic measurements of the receptor-bound\nfraction were feasible. Thus, the data do not hold the exact information\nabout how quickly a steady state between the structure and the MP\ncompartment is achieved. To minimize the effect of this parameter\nand avoid numerical problems on the joint-confidence regions, the\nfixed boundary of the parameter space explorer (i.e., 200) was used\nas an upper boundary of  k on . Consequently,\nalso the assumption of instantaneous binding could be another way\nof simplifying the present model. The described observation is in\nline with the high receptor affinity of thiacloprid to nAChRs, indicating\nthat the speed of in vivo receptor-binding kinetics are limited by\nthe initial uptake of thiacloprid into the structure compartment.\n\nBiotransformation of thiacloprid in amphipods was neither reported\nin the literature nor found in a screening for reported biotransformation\nproducts (e.g., thiacloprid amide) in bacteria 52  ( Supporting Information  A7).\nThus, in order to also display toxicokinetics of neonicotinoids or\nother receptor-bound compounds that are biotransformed in amphipods\n(e.g. imidacloprid 43 , 53 ), the presented model may be\nextended by considering biotransformation. However, further research\nwould be needed in order to understand and implement the exact mechanisms\nof biotransformation, such as compartment-dependent biotransformation\nand binding of biotransformation products to the nAChRs.\n\n## Considerations for Risk Assessment\n\nIn the present study,\nwe demonstrated that irreversible binding to MPs such as the nAChRs\nexplains the observed elimination resistance 22 , 31 , 32  of neonicotinoids from amphipod tissue.\nConsequently, this elimination-resistant fraction may explain the\ndelayed toxic effects and irreversible damages toward aquatic arthropods\nthat were previously reported. 17 , 18 , 45 , 53  In fact, the MP-associated fraction\nmay be interpreted as either irreversible damage to the nAChR or continuous\nexposure due to elimination resistance, depending on the point of\nview. The here-provided mechanistic insights may help to improve the\nunderstanding of toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics, and adverse outcome\npathways of neonicotinoids in arthropods. Such considerations may\nbe important for the risk assessment of neonicotinoids, as well as\ntheir replacement candidates (i.e., flupyradifurone 9 ) and other contaminants with (irreversible) receptor-binding\nproperties. Furthermore, existing TK–TD modeling approaches 19 , 48 , 53 , 54  may be updated based on the present findings.\n\nThe standard\nbioaccumulation assessment, according to OECD 305 25  using fish, generally assumes one-compartment kinetics,\nan independence of bioaccumulation parameters from exposure concentrations\nand a relevance of bioaccumulation only for compounds with high log  K OW  values. However, our toxicokinetic investigations\non neonicotinoids in aquatic invertebrates demonstrated a strong exposure\nconcentration dependence due to a maximum binding capacity and no\nelimination from the MP compartment. These mechanisms may result in\nBCFs above the threshold value for the B criterion (2000) at concentrations\ntypically observed in the environment (ng L –1  range). 5 , 16  In contrast to multi-compartment kinetics caused by sorption to\nexoskeleton/cuticula of aquatic invertebrates, 55  the here-reported second compartment consists of a bioactive,\nand thus toxicologically relevant, fraction. Similar mechanisms for\nelimination-resistant bioactive fractions may exist for other compound\nclasses with observed multi-compartment kinetics, such as strobilurins\nin amphipods. 26 , 32  However, further research is\nneeded to understand the underlying mechanisms and their toxicological\nrelevance. In order to account for concentration-dependent bioaccumulation,\na category such as “elimination-resistant” or “receptor-bound”\nmay be important for establishing new testing guidelines, i.e., for\nthe proposed bioaccumulation studies using arthropods. 27 , 56  With our developed toxicokinetic-receptor model, we provide the\nrequired modeling platform for such implementations.\n\nFurthermore,\nthe usefulness of environmental threshold concentrations\nfor elimination-resistant compounds such as neonicotinoids may be\nreconsidered. 16  Exposed organisms may accumulate\nneonicotinoids over their lifetime and eventually reach saturation\nof the nAChRs, regardless of the exposure concentration. Additionally,\nthis resistance toward elimination may explain trophic magnification\nin arthropods and transfer from aquatic to terrestrial food webs observed\nfor neonicotinoids elsewhere. 57  Furthermore,\nenvironmental parameters may have an impact on the toxicokinetics\nof neonicotinoids. For instance, temperature was demonstrated to exert\nan exponential relationship with uptake and elimination rates in amphipods. 32  This may result in much faster saturation of\nthe nAChRs, especially if high water concentrations co-occur with\nhigher temperatures, such as during a run-off event in the summer,\nand consequently enhance the exposure risks toward aquatic arthropods.\nHowever, further investigations of the interaction of temperature\nand neonicotinoid exposure are needed to evaluate this risk.",
