  "abstract": "Recent withdrawal of several drugs from the market due\nto elevated\nlevels of N-nitrosamine impurities underscores the\nneed for computational approaches to assess the carcinogenicity risk\nof nitrosamines. However, current approaches are limited because robust\nanimal carcinogenicity data are only available for a few simple nitrosamines,\nwhich do not represent the structural diversity of the many possible\nnitrosamine drug substance related impurities (NDSRIs). In this paper,\nwe present a novel method that uses data on CYP-mediated metabolic\nhydroxylation of CH2 groups in non-nitrosamine xenobiotics\nto identify structural features that may also help in predicting the\nlikelihood of metabolic α-carbon hydroxylation in N-nitrosamines. Our approach offers a new avenue for tapping into\npotentially large experimental data sets on xenobiotic metabolism\nto improve risk assessment of nitrosamines. As α-carbon hydroxylation\nis the crucial rate-limiting step in nitrosamine metabolic activation,\nidentifying and quantifying the influence of various structural features\non this step can provide valuable insights into their carcinogenic\npotential. This is especially important considering the scarce information\navailable on factors that affect NDSRI metabolic activation. We have\nidentified hundreds of structural features and calculated their impact\non hydroxylation, a significant advancement compared to the limited\nfindings from the small nitrosamine carcinogenicity data set. While\nrelying solely on α-carbon hydroxylation prediction is insufficient\nfor forecasting carcinogenic potency, the identified features can\nhelp in the selection of relevant structural analogues in read across\nstudies and assist experts who, after considering other factors such\nas the reactivity of the resulting electrophilic diazonium species,\ncan establish the acceptable intake (AI) limits for nitrosamine impurities.",

      "text": "Nitrosamines are found in a variety of\nsources including air, food,\nwater, tobacco, cosmetics, and packing materials.1−3 Due to their\npotentially strong carcinogenic effects,4,5 the International\nCouncil for Harmonisation (ICH) M7 guidance6 classifies N-nitrosamines as one of the three classes\nof cohort-of-concern compounds. Consequently, the daily acceptable\nintake (AI) of nitrosamines should be significantly lower than the\ndefault threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) of 1.5 μg/day\nfor other mutagenic impurities. The discovery of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) as an impurity in the drug valsartan\nin 2018 sparked a heightened focus on controlling nitrosamine impurities\nin the pharmaceutical industry,7 regulatory\nagencies,8 and scientific community.9 In addition, detection of several API-derived\ncomplex nitrosamines referred to as the nitrosamine drug substance\nrelated impurities (NDSRIs) prompted the withdrawal of several drugs\nfrom the market.10−13 Currently, regulators typically recommend a conservative AI of 18\nng/day for a novel NDSRI in cases where animal carcinogenicity data\nare not available or when proper structurally related surrogates are\nabsent. However, the carcinogenic potency of nitrosamines varies considerably14−16 as indicated by the TD50 values derived from animal testing.\nThus, imposing a uniform limit of 18 ng/day for all nitrosamines may\nnot be necessary. Such a measure could have unintended economic consequences\nfor the pharmaceutical industry, potentially resulting in medication\nshortages for the public. The absence of carcinogenicity testing\ndata creates a significant\nchallenge in evaluating complex nitrosamines, such as the NDSRIs.\nAccording to a recent publication by Schlingemann et al.,17 nitrosamines are quite likely to be present\nin drug substances with 40.4% of APIs and 29.6% of API impurities\nhaving the potential to form these compounds. Despite available animal\ncarcinogenicity data for several small nitrosamines, they are often\nnot representative enough for the NDSRIs. Hence, the scientific community\nmust seek alternative methods to assess nitrosamines that lack or\nhave limited data. Various approaches in this regard can potentially\nbe employed, including alternative in vivo and in vitro18 assays as well as computational methods such\nas (quantitative) structure–activity relationships ((Q)SARs).19,20 Specifically, structure–activity relationships (SARs) have\nshown potential as regulatory agencies have utilized surrogate-based\nSARs to establish AI levels for some nitrosamine impurities,21 and several SAR-based studies have recently\nbeen published.22−24 Quantum chemical approaches have also been applied\nto calculate the reactivity of N-nitrosamines as\ndemonstrated by Wenzel et al.25 and others.26−28 Despite the potential demonstrated by the surrogate-based\nSAR methods,\ntheir effectiveness is limited by the narrow structural diversity\nof small nitrosamines, restricting their ability in evaluating carcinogenic\npotential of the untested NDSRIs with diverse structures. Nonetheless,\nsome key structural features have been identified as contributing\nto reduced carcinogenic potency, such as the presence of electron-withdrawing\nsubstituents at the β-carbon, steric bulk at the α-carbon,\nabsence of α-carbon hydrogens, and carboxylic acid groups.23,24 Conversely, features known to increase potency include small alkyl\nside chains, benzylic side chains, β-carbonyl groups, and allylic\nor propargylic side chains.23 Thus, the\nnumber of features discovered so far is small, and it remains uncertain\nwhether small nitrosamines can continue to be the only source of comprehensive\nand reliable assessment of the carcinogenicity risk of the numerous\nNDSRIs; a breakthrough is desperately needed. In this paper,\nwe present a novel method for predicting the likelihood\nof α-carbon hydroxylation, one of the crucial steps in the metabolic\nactivation of nitrosamines leading to carcinogenicity. α-Hydroxylation\nis the rate-limiting step in cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated metabolic\nactivation of nitrosamines, forming a nitrosocarbinolamine species\nthat decomposes into a DNA-reactive electrophilic diazonium species.29−31 It is generally agreed that substituents that reduce the likelihood\nof α-carbon hydroxylation on the N-nitrosamine\nthrough electronic or steric effects tend to reduce carcinogenic potency.32 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) for example\nconsiders nitrosamines containing an α-hydrogen capable of metabolic\nactivation to be potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic to humans,\nwith varying potencies based on the nature of the functional groups,\nthe specifics of metabolic activation, and repair efficiency and capacity.33 Our approach, based on the metabolism\nof non-nitrosamine xenobiotics,\naims to identify key structural features influencing aliphatic carbon\nhydroxylation. Using a large data set of non-nitrosamine xenobiotic\nmetabolism consisting of substrate–metabolite pairs of various\nchemicals, drugs, and drug-like compounds, we employed computational\nmethods similar to those used for predicting xenobiotic sites of metabolism\n(SOM).34−37 Specifically, we focused on the likelihood of hydroxylation of methylene\n(-CH2-) groups, hypothesizing that structural features\naffecting CH2 hydroxylation in xenobiotics would also affect\nα-CH2 hydroxylation in nitrosamines as both processes\nare mediated by CYP enzymes.30,38 We assumed that the\nnitrosamine moiety would have a constant effect while other structural\nfeatures would exert relative modulation. Our modeling yielded numerous\nstatistically significant fragments affecting likelihood of hydroxylation,\nwhich we used to create molecular fingerprints for grouping nitrosamines\nand discovering novel SARs. Additionally, we used the computed α-carbon\nhydroxylation probabilities to guide the selection of read-across\nanalogues that can potentially be used to establish daily AI limits\nof NDSRIs. While the predicted values of α-hydroxylation\ndid not directly\nexhibit a correlation with carcinogenicity of small nitrosamines,\nas other factors may also influence it, this study identified several\nhighly valuable features and their effects. This work is significant\nbecause it provides a more comprehensive evaluation of complex NDSRIs\nby enabling the computation of the quantitative contributions of a\nwider and expandable range of structural features. As a result, it\nbroadens our ability to evaluate complex NDSRIs and overcomes some\nof the limitations of the prior studies."

This database contains\n16,318 substrate–metabolite pairs with information on enzymes,\norgans, and species, sourced from various publications.39,40 We narrowed down the data set to 620 pairs involving only CH2 hydroxylation (CH2 to CH–OH conversion).\nThe transformations were primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP)\nenzymes. Each substrate–metabolite pair may contain multiple\nCH2 groups, with some undergoing metabolic hydroxylation\nwhile others do not (Figure 1a). In total, we used 3530 CH2 sites as individual\ndata points for developing models to predict CH2 hydroxylation.\nIt is important to note that the curated data set does not include\nany instances of N-nitrosamines undergoing α-carbon\nhydroxylation. Instead, we manually incorporated a term for the >N–N=O\nmoiety in the regression equation when applying it to N-nitrosamines (see below). Example of a xenobiotic substrate undergoing\nmetabolic hydroxylation\nat a CH2 group, (a) CH2 group highlighted with\nan orange circle is the active site, whereas the ones highlighted\nwith the gray circles are inactive CH2 sites, i.e., not\nhydroxylated. (b) Molecular fragments generated from the local environment\n(highlighted with red bonds) of the active CH2 site (C3—sp3 non-ring carbon, C2—sp2 non-ring carbon, CR3—sp3\ncarbon in a non-aromatic ring, CR2—sp2 carbon in a non-aromatic\nring, C3H3—sp3 non-ring carbon with three hydrogens, CR3H—sp3\ncarbon with one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring, CR3H2—sp3\ncarbon with two hydrogens in a non-aromatic ring, and CR2H—sp2\ncarbon with one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring). We collected a data\nset of nitrosamines with animal carcinogenicity assay outcomes from\nvarious sources, including the publication of Dobo et al.22 and data collected by MultiCASE. The data were\noriginally obtained from the Carcinogenic Potency Database by Gold\net al.41 and some other publications.42−44 Nitrosoureas, nitrosoguanidines, compounds with multiple nitrosamine\ngroups, and nitrosamines without any α-CH2 groups\nwere excluded, resulting in a final set of 84 compounds. The carcinogenic\npotency was expressed as TD50 in units of mg/kg/day. We obtained a list of potential drug substance\nrelated nitrosamines from Schlingemann et al.17 Structures of these NDSRIs were generated by Schlingemann et al.\nfrom a large list of small drug and drug impurities. The original\nlist contained 9862 compounds, which were curated by removing duplicates,\nneutralizing charges, correcting atom type errors, and removing compounds\nwith multiple nitrosamine groups or without α-CH2 groups. This resulted in a final set of 6277 nitrosamines. We encoded the local structural environments of\nactive and inactive CH2 groups of xenobiotics by generating\nsmall molecular fragments with the CH2 group as the starting\npoint (Figure 1). Active\nCH2 groups undergo hydroxylation in substrate–metabolite\npairs, whereas the inactive CH2 groups do not (Figure 1a). The generated\nfragments were used as descriptors in model building. They were also\nused to encode the structural environment of the α-CH2 groups in nitrosamines in the form of fingerprints (see below). The molecular fragment representations (Figure 1b) were produced using an algorithm modified\nfrom one which is used for generating unique SMILES representation,45 resulting in a distinct textual representation.\nThis representation depicts atom attributes such as element type,\nhybridization, aromaticity, number of attached hydrogens, and ring\nmemberships, providing a visually interpretable and information-rich\nencoding of structural information beyond that of conventional SMILES.\nFor example, in the fragment [CR2](=[CR2H]-[CR3H2])-[CR3H2], CR2 represents\na sp2 carbon that lacks any hydrogens in a non-aromatic ring, CR2H\nrepresents a sp2 carbon having one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring,\nand CR3H2 represents a sp3 carbon having two hydrogens in a non-aromatic\nring. We utilized a subset of 620 substrates from the xenobiotic database\nto create a model to predict the likelihood of CYP-mediated hydroxylation\nat CH2 sites. The model building process is depicted in Figure 2. Each CH2 group in a substrate–metabolite pair was considered a data\npoint, resulting in 3530 CH2 sites, with 839 active and\n2691 inactive ones. Active CH2 groups were assigned a label\nof 1, while inactive CH2 groups were labeled 0. These labels\nare similar to the biological activity data (Y) in\na QSAR. The counts of fragment descriptors generated from the local\nenvironment of each CH2 group were used in the X-matrix.\nAny fragment that appeared in less than 5 CH2 groups was\nremoved to prevent overfitting. Process of building a model involves collecting m fragments from the structural environments of n CH2 groups from the xenobiotic training set.\nFollowing\nthe variable selection process, m′ fragments\nremain. The orange and green boxes in the Y-column indicate active\nand inactive CH2 groups, respectively. The X-matrix comprises\ncounts of various fragments (frg1, frg2, etc.). During the regression fitting process,\nthe the regression coefficients (a1, a2, etc.)\nand the regression constant are computed to derive\neq 1, Figure 2, which\nessentially is the model. We also employed a variable selection process to\nidentify fragments\nthat are not relevant to CH2 hydroxylation. For example,\n644 linear fragments up to 4 atoms long were initially generated from\nthe training set, but only 386 fragments survived the variable selection\nprocess. The “R” package glmnet(46,47) was used for this purpose. It combines 10-fold cross-validation\nwith the logistic regression method and generates coefficients for\nthe fragments (a1, a2,...am’ in eq 1, Figure 2). In the resulting model, fragments with positive\ncoefficients were considered favorable for hydroxylation, while negative\ncoefficients were considered inhibitory. To predict metabolic hydroxylation\nprobability of a CH2 group in a query compound, fragments\naround it are generated and matched with model fragments, and a probability\nvalue is computed using eq 1, Figure 2. If any fragments are found outside of the training\nset, they are classified as “uncovered fragments,” and\nthe outcome can be considered as out-of-domain. As the training\ndata set for xenobiotic metabolism does not include instances of N-nitrosamines undergoing α-carbon hydroxylation,\nwe manually added a term for the >N–N=O moiety to\neq\n1, Figure 2, when applying\nit to predict the α-hydroxylation of N-nitrosamines.\nA high coefficient value of +2.00 was assigned to this term to ensure\nthat the nitrosamine moiety always has a constant positive effect\nwhile other groups have a positive or negative modulatory impact on\nthe predicted probability. Moreover, this value yielded a satisfactory\ndistribution of calculated hydroxylation probabilities for nitrosamines,\npreventing extreme values close to 0 or 1. It also counterbalances\nthe negative effects of xenobiotic amine-based fragments on hydroxylation.\nThe Supporting Information provides necessary details. Fingerprints\nwere needed for comparing and clustering nitrosamines based on their\nstructural features relevant to α-CH2 hydroxylation.\nTo do so, a vector containing the same number of slots as there were\nfragments in the X-matrix of the model (i.e., 644) was created. Next,\neach slot of this vector was filled with the corresponding regression\ncoefficients of the fragments from the prior step of modeling CH2-hydroxylation in xenobiotics. Molecular structure handling, curation, molecular\nfragmentation, database operations, metabolism site detection, and\nmodeling were carried out using an in-house cheminformatics software\nlibrary. The cv.glmnet procedure was performed using\nthe “R” package glmnet.(46,47) Clustering was performed using the “R” package rtsne.(48) We have utilized the MultiCASE software QSAR Flex(21,49) to find appropriate analogues for NDSRIs in certain\ncases."

Our findings, depicted in Figure 3, demonstrate that structural diversity of small nitrosamines\nis quite limited compared to NDSRIs, with only 118 fragments shared\nbetween them. This finding suggests that small nitrosamines are not\nadequate representatives of the structural diversity of potential\nNDSRIs. Comparison of structural environments of α-CH2 groups\nof NDSRIs, small carcinogenic nitrosamines, and the CH2 groups of the xenobiotic data set, with the aid of unique\nmolecular fragments.

The data set of xenobiotics produced 781 fragments,\nout of which\n525 were also identified in NDSRIs. While this number still does not\nmeet the desired level of diversity, it is much higher compared to\nthe small nitrosamine data set.

To identify\nthe most effective molecular fragment types for predicting CH2 hydroxylation, we conducted cross-validation of models built\nfrom these fragments, including linear, atom-centered, and of different\nsizes with varying information on atom nodes. We performed 10-fold\nleave-many-out cross-validations with the following settings:i.Linear fragments, 3 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.ii.Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.iii.Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.iv.Linear fragments, 7 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.v.Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, no differentiation of aliphatic\nring atoms, and explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.vi.Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (8 or\nsmaller) marked, and no explicit\nhydrogens on aromatic carbons.vii.Atom-centered fragments, 5\natoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and\nno explicit hydrogens on aromatic carbons.

Our findings, presented in Figure 4, demonstrate that linear fragments outperform\natom-centered fragments, with the best performance achieved using\nthe 4-atom linear fragments that depict ring size of 8 or smaller.\nWhen used in the N-nitrosamines, 4-atom linear fragments\ncapture structural environment up to a distance of 5 atoms from the\nnitrosamine moiety’s amine nitrogen as the fragments originate\nfrom the α-CH2 group. Different variations\nof fragment settings and their effect on the\nmodel’s CV performance (average ROC-AUC) for predicting xenobiotic\nCH2-hydroxylation. The green bar is the best performing\nfragment setting which was used in subsequent steps (LF—linear\nfragments and ACF—atom centered fragments). The inferior performance of the atom-centered fragments\nis likely\ndue to their more complex structure, resulting in overly specific\nfragments. Our analysis indicates that 4-atom linear fragments are\noptimal as 3-atom fragments do not capture sufficient structural variation,\nand larger fragments offer no additional benefits as features too\nfar away from the CH2 site likely have negligible effects. We utilized molecular\nfragments to represent the structural environment around CH2 groups and assess their impact on hydroxylation. Our model was trained\nusing 3530 CH2 groups, with 839 undergoing hydroxylation\nand 2691 remaining unchanged, identifying 375 fragments that exhibited\nabsolute regression coefficients of at least 0.01, comprising 141\npositive and 234 negative fragments.

The nitrosamines were clustered\nusing tSNE methodology and color-coded based on their hydroxylation\nprobability (Figures 5 and 6).

The results are shown in Table 3. Interestingly, the\ncomputed values concurred with expert deductions, except for the impact\nof the β-carbonyl group. We confirmed the deactivating effect\nof the carboxylic acid group19 in the side\nchain within a distance of 4 atoms and observed the boosting effects\nof the benzyl, allyl, and small alkyl chains, which validates expert\nopinions. The hydroxylation value of the β-carbonyl group was\nlower because of fewer active CH2 groups compared to inactive\nCH2 groups adjacent to carbonyl groups in the xenobiotic\nsubstrates. We were unable to compute values for some features due\nto uncovered fragments, e.g., strong electron withdrawing −CF3 group. Such data gaps could potentially be filled by expanding\nthe xenobiotic metabolism data set in the future. Feature exists in xenobiotics next\nto a CH2 group without a N-nitroso group. Feature exists in NDSRIs next\nto\na CH2 group which is “alpha” to a N-nitroso group. Nonetheless, the clustering exercise (refer to Figures 5 and 6) yielded very valuable information on the quantitative effects\nof\na significantly greater number of NDSRI features than those identified\nby experts to date.23,24 It also provides useful structure–activity\nrelations, for example as shown in Table 1, varying effects of aromatic rings at β\nposition, a benzylic side chain (cluster #6) yields a probability\nof 0.55, but the 3-methylene pyridine version has a slightly lower\nprobability (0.49, cluster #8), whereas, the 2-methylene thiophene\nand the 2-methylene pyridine give significantly higher values of 0.81\n(cluster #1) and 0.82 (cluster #2), respectively. Similarly as shown\nin Table 2, various\nfeatures for cyclic nitrosamines were also identified. For example,\npresence of an aromatic ring within a distance of 1, 2, or 3 atoms\nfrom the >N–N=O moiety increases the probability\nof\nα-hydroxylation (clusters #1 and 3–5), whereas, substitution\non the α-position on any side decreases the probability, e.g.,\nclusters #6 and 7. This observation corroborates previous publications\nthat steric hindrance on the α-carbon inhibits the metabolic\nactivation of nitrosamines.23,24,50 Additionally, presence of a nitrogen in the ring at the 3-position\ndecreases the probability of α-hydroxylation. This can be observed\nin clusters #8 and 9. We predicted the likelihood of hydroxylation\nfor 21 nitrosamines with reliable carcinogenicity TD50 data\n(Lhasa TD5051,52). Maximum value was taken in\nthe case of two α-CH2 groups. Uncovered fragments\nwere identified in seven nitrosamines, results for the rest are shown\nin Figure 7, in which\nno apparent correlation was observed between the predicted hydroxylation\nand the carcinogenic potency. Factors other than hydroxylation, such\nas reactivity of the diazonium intermediate or alternate metabolic\npathways, may explain this lack of correlation. Nitrosamines with\nlow reactivity of the diazonium intermediate can be less carcinogenic\neven after rapid hydroxylation. Carcinogenic potency compared to the probability\nof α-CH2 hydroxylation of 14 small nitrosamines.\nThe orange dot corresponds\nto N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA). To further\nexplore the relationship between carcinogenic potency and α-hydroxylation,\nwe built a QSAR model directly using the carcinogenic potencies (−Log\nTD50) of 84 small nitrosamines and fragments around their\nα-CH2 groups as descriptors. As a result, 15 fragments\nwere identified that positively or negatively affect carcinogenicity\npotency and we compared their regression coefficients to those obtained\nfrom modeling xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation. Table 4 shows that out of the 15 fragments,\n14 were also found in the xenobiotic data set. Interestingly, three\nfragments with positive effects on carcinogenicity also had a positive\neffect on xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation and four with negative\ninfluence on carcinogenicity had a negative effect on xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation too. Particularly noteworthy is the fragment\n[C3H2]-[N3]-[C3H3], which demonstrated conflicting contributions.\nWhile being part of the >N–N=O moiety of methyl nitrosamines\nin the carcinogenicity data set led to its expected positive contribution\ntoward carcinogenicity, it had a negative coefficient in xenobiotic\nhydroxylation because of being a part of tertiary amines that apparently\nexert a negative effect on CH2-hydroxylation. Despite the\nlimited size of the nitrosamine data set, our findings provide compelling\nevidence that certain structural features that modulate CH2 hydroxylation in xenobiotics also have similar effects on the carcinogenic\npotency of nitrosamines. The CH2 site is highlighted\nin red. Establishing\nAI limits for complex N-nitrosamines in the absence\nof animal carcinogenicity data poses a critical challenge.23 While read-across using analogues is a common\npractice,21 selecting a single analogue\nfor AI elucidation remains difficult. It is therefore important to\nperform a critical analysis of the analogues’ structural features\nin relation to the query as molecular similarity measures alone are\ninsufficient. The predictive model built in this study is a\nvaluable tool for identifying small analogues by comparing their α-hydroxylation\npotential to the query N-nitrosamine. Also, structural\nfragments that are pertinent to α-hydroxylation can be used\nto assess the reliability of these analogues as “uncovered\nfragments” in close proximity to the nitrosamine moiety of\nthe analogues or absence of crucial fragments relative to the query\nnitrosamine should be deemed less reliable and consequently can be\nconsidered for exclusion. The methodology is demonstrated through\nsome examples below, highlighting\nthe importance of careful selection of analogues for the establishment\nof AI limits for complex N-nitrosamines. In this study,\nwe applied the calculation of the likelihood of α-hydroxylation\nto the N-nitroso derivative of varenicline and three\nrelated N-nitrosamine analogues (NPIP, NHEX, and\nNTHP) with available carcinogenicity data (Figure 8). The analogues are taken from a recent\npublication by Ponting et al.23 The predicted\nhydroxylation values for N-nitroso varenicline, NPIP,\nand NHEX were 0.63, 0.56, and 0.56, respectively. Notably, the hydroxylation\nvalues for NPIP and NHEX were identical despite their differing ring\nsizes due to our modeling process treating rings of size 5–8\nequally. Application of α-hydroxylation computation on N-nitroso varenicline and its structurally similar analogues for establishing\na daily AI limit. α-CH2 groups are shown with orange\ncircles (Pα-hydrox—computed probability of α-hydroxylation\nand NC—not calculated due to the presence of uncovered fragments). The AI limit for N-nitroso varenicline\nhas been\nset at 37 ng/day by several regulatory agencies, who have used NTHP\nas a surrogate to determine the appropriate threshold.53−55 However, the α-hydroxylation value for NTHP could not be reliably\ncalculated due to the presence of “uncovered fragments”\nnear the nitrosamine moiety resulting from the presence of unsaturation\nin the ring, indicating its structural dissimilarity to N-nitroso varenicline, NPIP, and NHEX. Conversely, NPIP and NHEX exhibited\nhydroxylation values comparable to N-nitroso varenicline\nand are deemed suitable surrogates for deriving the AI limit, consistent\nwith the opinion of Ponting et al. As a conservative measure, we can\nselect NHEX as the surrogate for AI derivation. According to Ponting\net al.,23 the AI limit was established\nas 110 ng/day using the TD50 of NHEX from the most sensitive\ntumorigenic site (TD50 = 0.110 mg/kg/day). In this study,\nwe aimed to assess the potential carcinogenicity of N-nitroso nortriptyline by comparing its α-hydroxylation potential\nwith that of the three structurally related analogues identified by\nthe QSAR Flex software program (Figure 9). QSAR Flex utilizes a database of small nitrosamines with carcinogenicity data\nto match different atom types around the nitrosamine moiety for identifying\nsuitable analogues. Application of α-hydroxylation computation on N-nitroso nortriptyline and its structurally similar analogues.\nα-CH2 groups are shown with orange circles (Pα-hydrox—computed\nprobability of α-hydroxylation). It is noteworthy that several regulatory agencies,\nincluding Health\nCanada55 and the EMA,54 have established an extremely low AI limit of 8 ng/day\nfor N-nitroso nortriptyline based on the TD50 of 0.008 mg/kg/day for N-nitroso methylphenethyl\namine. However, our findings raise a question about the appropriateness\nof such a low AI limit for this particular NDSRI, given its relatively\nlow α-hydroxylation value of only 0.07, in comparison to the\nhigher values observed for the three analogues, including N-nitroso methylphenethyl amine. Despite experimental\nevidence indicating that the primary clearance pathway for the selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine involves metabolic modification\nof the 1,3-benzdioxole ring and that no metabolites resulting from\nα-carbon hydroxylation after a possible nitrosation of the piperidine\nring were observed in humans,23 we conducted\nthis case study to evaluate the potential carcinogenicity of N-nitroso paroxetine to account for the theoretical possibility\nof its introduction via external sources, e.g., as an impurity. Specifically,\nwe aimed to compare its α-hydroxylation potential with that\nof three structurally related analogues (Figure 10). Application of α-hydroxylation computation\non N-nitroso paroxetine and its structurally similar\nanalogues. α-CH2 groups are shown with orange circles\n(Pα-hydrox—computed\nprobability of α-hydroxylation). Our results revealed that N-nitroso\nparoxetine\nexhibited a significantly higher α-hydroxylation potential of\n0.86 than two of its analogues, nitrosopiperdinol (0.61) and nitrosopiperidine\n(0.56). Conversely, 1-nitroso-3-pyrrolidinol, the third analogue,\ndemonstrated a slightly higher hydroxylation potential (0.78) than\nthe other two analogues; however, its 5-membered ring structure, which\nis more constrained, may explain its higher TD50 value.\nGiven the potential risks associated with nitrosamine impurities where\nutmost caution is warranted, utilizing these analogues to establish\nAI level for N-nitroso paroxetine is inadvisable.\nAdditional investigations are imperative to explore alternative methods\nfor assessing the safety of N-nitroso paroxetine. While our study presented\na promising method for predicting the probability of metabolic α-carbon\nhydroxylation of N-nitrosamines, there are several\nlimitations that should be considered when interpreting the outcomes\nof this methodology.1.The developed model is only applicable\nto nitrosamines that contain at least one α-CH2 group.\nHowever, this limitation can potentially be addressed by creating\nsimilar models for α-CH and α-CH3 groups by utilizing\nxenobiotic metabolism data. This would allow us to expand the coverage\nof NDSRIs and identify new features.2.While the model we developed represents\na significant improvement over relying solely on a small carcinogenic\nnitrosamine database, it still identifies “uncovered features”\nin some query nitrosamines, which can lead to unreliable predictions.\nThis is similar to the out-of-domain outcomes that are commonly encountered\nin QSAR models and can be addressed by collecting and utilizing a\nmore extensive range of xenobiotic metabolism data to improve the\nmodel’s coverage.3.Our study suggests that predicting\nα-carbon hydroxylation alone may not be sufficient for accurately\nassessing the carcinogenic potential of NDSRIs since we found little\noverall correlation between predicted α-CH2 hydroxylation\nand the TD50 values of the experimental test set. Other\nfactors, such as the reactivity of the resulting diazonium intermediate\nand various alternative metabolic clearance routes, can significantly\nimpact their carcinogenic potency. These factors require careful scrutiny\nin the risk assessment of NDSRIs.4.Furthermore, this approach may not\nfully capture the metabolic chemistry unique to nitrosamines. Specifically,\nour method does not consider any intramolecular rearrangements involving\nthe nitrosamine moiety that may occur during α-hydroxylation.\nThis limitation highlights the need for further research.5.The accuracy of our α-hydroxylation\nprediction model is entirely reliant on the xenobiotic metabolism\ndata, particularly the substrate–metabolite pairs. Any spontaneous\nrearrangement that obstructs the detection of the newly added OH group\nor omission of reporting intermediate hydroxylation products may likely\nimpact the results.

      "text": "Establishing\nAI limits for complex N-nitrosamines in the absence\nof animal carcinogenicity data poses a critical challenge.23 While read-across using analogues is a common\npractice,21 selecting a single analogue\nfor AI elucidation remains difficult. It is therefore important to\nperform a critical analysis of the analogues’ structural features\nin relation to the query as molecular similarity measures alone are\ninsufficient. The predictive model built in this study is a\nvaluable tool for identifying small analogues by comparing their α-hydroxylation\npotential to the query N-nitrosamine. Also, structural\nfragments that are pertinent to α-hydroxylation can be used\nto assess the reliability of these analogues as “uncovered\nfragments” in close proximity to the nitrosamine moiety of\nthe analogues or absence of crucial fragments relative to the query\nnitrosamine should be deemed less reliable and consequently can be\nconsidered for exclusion. The methodology is demonstrated through\nsome examples below, highlighting\nthe importance of careful selection of analogues for the establishment\nof AI limits for complex N-nitrosamines. In this study,\nwe applied the calculation of the likelihood of α-hydroxylation\nto the N-nitroso derivative of varenicline and three\nrelated N-nitrosamine analogues (NPIP, NHEX, and\nNTHP) with available carcinogenicity data (Figure 8). The analogues are taken from a recent\npublication by Ponting et al.23 The predicted\nhydroxylation values for N-nitroso varenicline, NPIP,\nand NHEX were 0.63, 0.56, and 0.56, respectively.

As a conservative measure, we can\nselect NHEX as the surrogate for AI derivation. According to Ponting\net al.,23 the AI limit was established\nas 110 ng/day using the TD50 of NHEX from the most sensitive\ntumorigenic site (TD50 = 0.110 mg/kg/day).

      "text": "In this study, we aimed to develop a method\nfor identifying and\nquantifying the contributions of various structural features to the\nmetabolic hydroxylation of the α-CH2 groups of N-nitrosamines, a critical and rate-limiting step for these\ncompounds to become DNA reactive and eventually carcinogenic. To achieve\nthis, we utilized substrate–metabolite pairs of non-nitrosamine\nxenobiotics to build models for CH2-hydroxylation and made\nheadway in addressing the challenge of limited animal carcinogenicity\ndata availability for assessing the carcinogenic potential of untested\nnitrosamines. Our study revealed that the computed importance\nof molecular fragments\naround α-CH2 groups could be used to construct fingerprints\nfor nitrosamines, enabling effective clustering and identification\nof key features that illuminate the SARs of α-carbon hydroxylation.\nBy expanding the set of statistically significant structural features\nthat may potentially affect the α-hydroxylation step, our study\nenhances our ability to assess complex NDSRIs. It is worth noting\nthat our study showed little overall correlation\nbetween predicted α-CH2 hydroxylation and the overall\nTD50 for the experimental test set. This suggests that\npredicting the α-carbon hydroxylation probability alone may\nnot be sufficient for accurately assessing the carcinogenic potential\nof NDSRIs. However, we did find that the relative contributions of\nmolecular fragments related to α-carbon hydroxylation overlapped\nwith fragment contributions to nitrosamine carcinogenic potency despite\nthe lack of direct correlation between predicted α-carbon hydroxylation\nprobabilities and carcinogenic potency. This suggests that our approach\nmay provide a valuable complement to the read across method for predicting\nthe carcinogenic potential of NDSRIs. Also, comparison of prediction\nperformance of fragments of different lengths indicates that structural\nfeatures beyond 4 atoms offer no additional benefits, an important\nconsideration in developing SARs and analogue selection. Finally,\nour study demonstrated that the small data set of nitrosamines\nwith available carcinogenicity data is insufficient to represent the\nstructural diversity of NDSRIs. However, by predicting α-carbon\nhydroxylation, we can narrow down the list of analogues for establishing\ndaily AI limits, improving the accuracy and reliability of risk assessment\nfor nitrosamines. Overall, our study provides a promising framework\nfor advancing the risk assessment of nitrosamines."

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nNitrosamines are found in a variety of\nsources including air, food,\nwater, tobacco, cosmetics, and packing materials.1−3 Due to their\npotentially strong carcinogenic effects,4,5 the International\nCouncil for Harmonisation (ICH) M7 guidance6 classifies N-nitrosamines as one of the three classes\nof cohort-of-concern compounds. Consequently, the daily acceptable\nintake (AI) of nitrosamines should be significantly lower than the\ndefault threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) of 1.5 μg/day\nfor other mutagenic impurities. The discovery of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) as an impurity in the drug valsartan\nin 2018 sparked a heightened focus on controlling nitrosamine impurities\nin the pharmaceutical industry,7 regulatory\nagencies,8 and scientific community.9 In addition, detection of several API-derived\ncomplex nitrosamines referred to as the nitrosamine drug substance\nrelated impurities (NDSRIs) prompted the withdrawal of several drugs\nfrom the market.10−13 Currently, regulators typically recommend a conservative AI of 18\nng/day for a novel NDSRI in cases where animal carcinogenicity data\nare not available or when proper structurally related surrogates are\nabsent. However, the carcinogenic potency of nitrosamines varies considerably14−16 as indicated by the TD50 values derived from animal testing.\nThus, imposing a uniform limit of 18 ng/day for all nitrosamines may\nnot be necessary. Such a measure could have unintended economic consequences\nfor the pharmaceutical industry, potentially resulting in medication\nshortages for the public. The absence of carcinogenicity testing\ndata creates a significant\nchallenge in evaluating complex nitrosamines, such as the NDSRIs.\nAccording to a recent publication by Schlingemann et al.,17 nitrosamines are quite likely to be present\nin drug substances with 40.4% of APIs and 29.6% of API impurities\nhaving the potential to form these compounds. Despite available animal\ncarcinogenicity data for several small nitrosamines, they are often\nnot representative enough for the NDSRIs. Hence, the scientific community\nmust seek alternative methods to assess nitrosamines that lack or\nhave limited data. Various approaches in this regard can potentially\nbe employed, including alternative in vivo and in vitro18 assays as well as computational methods such\nas (quantitative) structure–activity relationships ((Q)SARs).19,20 Specifically, structure–activity relationships (SARs) have\nshown potential as regulatory agencies have utilized surrogate-based\nSARs to establish AI levels for some nitrosamine impurities,21 and several SAR-based studies have recently\nbeen published.22−24 Quantum chemical approaches have also been applied\nto calculate the reactivity of N-nitrosamines as\ndemonstrated by Wenzel et al.25 and others.26−28 Despite the potential demonstrated by the surrogate-based\nSAR methods,\ntheir effectiveness is limited by the narrow structural diversity\nof small nitrosamines, restricting their ability in evaluating carcinogenic\npotential of the untested NDSRIs with diverse structures. Nonetheless,\nsome key structural features have been identified as contributing\nto reduced carcinogenic potency, such as the presence of electron-withdrawing\nsubstituents at the β-carbon, steric bulk at the α-carbon,\nabsence of α-carbon hydrogens, and carboxylic acid groups.23,24 Conversely, features known to increase potency include small alkyl\nside chains, benzylic side chains, β-carbonyl groups, and allylic\nor propargylic side chains.23 Thus, the\nnumber of features discovered so far is small, and it remains uncertain\nwhether small nitrosamines can continue to be the only source of comprehensive\nand reliable assessment of the carcinogenicity risk of the numerous\nNDSRIs; a breakthrough is desperately needed. In this paper,\nwe present a novel method for predicting the likelihood\nof α-carbon hydroxylation, one of the crucial steps in the metabolic\nactivation of nitrosamines leading to carcinogenicity. α-Hydroxylation\nis the rate-limiting step in cytochrome P450 (CYP) mediated metabolic\nactivation of nitrosamines, forming a nitrosocarbinolamine species\nthat decomposes into a DNA-reactive electrophilic diazonium species.29−31 It is generally agreed that substituents that reduce the likelihood\nof α-carbon hydroxylation on the N-nitrosamine\nthrough electronic or steric effects tend to reduce carcinogenic potency.32 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) for example\nconsiders nitrosamines containing an α-hydrogen capable of metabolic\nactivation to be potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic to humans,\nwith varying potencies based on the nature of the functional groups,\nthe specifics of metabolic activation, and repair efficiency and capacity.33 Our approach, based on the metabolism\nof non-nitrosamine xenobiotics,\naims to identify key structural features influencing aliphatic carbon\nhydroxylation. Using a large data set of non-nitrosamine xenobiotic\nmetabolism consisting of substrate–metabolite pairs of various\nchemicals, drugs, and drug-like compounds, we employed computational\nmethods similar to those used for predicting xenobiotic sites of metabolism\n(SOM).34−37 Specifically, we focused on the likelihood of hydroxylation of methylene\n(-CH2-) groups, hypothesizing that structural features\naffecting CH2 hydroxylation in xenobiotics would also affect\nα-CH2 hydroxylation in nitrosamines as both processes\nare mediated by CYP enzymes.30,38 We assumed that the\nnitrosamine moiety would have a constant effect while other structural\nfeatures would exert relative modulation. Our modeling yielded numerous\nstatistically significant fragments affecting likelihood of hydroxylation,\nwhich we used to create molecular fingerprints for grouping nitrosamines\nand discovering novel SARs. Additionally, we used the computed α-carbon\nhydroxylation probabilities to guide the selection of read-across\nanalogues that can potentially be used to establish daily AI limits\nof NDSRIs. While the predicted values of α-hydroxylation\ndid not directly\nexhibit a correlation with carcinogenicity of small nitrosamines,\nas other factors may also influence it, this study identified several\nhighly valuable features and their effects. This work is significant\nbecause it provides a more comprehensive evaluation of complex NDSRIs\nby enabling the computation of the quantitative contributions of a\nwider and expandable range of structural features. As a result, it\nbroadens our ability to evaluate complex NDSRIs and overcomes some\nof the limitations of the prior studies.\n\n## Data and Methods\nWe obtained xenobiotic metabolism\ndata from our in-house database at MultiCASE. This database contains\n16,318 substrate–metabolite pairs with information on enzymes,\norgans, and species, sourced from various publications.39,40 We narrowed down the data set to 620 pairs involving only CH2 hydroxylation (CH2 to CH–OH conversion).\nThe transformations were primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP)\nenzymes. Each substrate–metabolite pair may contain multiple\nCH2 groups, with some undergoing metabolic hydroxylation\nwhile others do not (Figure 1a). In total, we used 3530 CH2 sites as individual\ndata points for developing models to predict CH2 hydroxylation.\nIt is important to note that the curated data set does not include\nany instances of N-nitrosamines undergoing α-carbon\nhydroxylation. Instead, we manually incorporated a term for the >N–N=O\nmoiety in the regression equation when applying it to N-nitrosamines (see below). Example of a xenobiotic substrate undergoing\nmetabolic hydroxylation\nat a CH2 group, (a) CH2 group highlighted with\nan orange circle is the active site, whereas the ones highlighted\nwith the gray circles are inactive CH2 sites, i.e., not\nhydroxylated. (b) Molecular fragments generated from the local environment\n(highlighted with red bonds) of the active CH2 site (C3—sp3 non-ring carbon, C2—sp2 non-ring carbon, CR3—sp3\ncarbon in a non-aromatic ring, CR2—sp2 carbon in a non-aromatic\nring, C3H3—sp3 non-ring carbon with three hydrogens, CR3H—sp3\ncarbon with one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring, CR3H2—sp3\ncarbon with two hydrogens in a non-aromatic ring, and CR2H—sp2\ncarbon with one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring). We collected a data\nset of nitrosamines with animal carcinogenicity assay outcomes from\nvarious sources, including the publication of Dobo et al.22 and data collected by MultiCASE. The data were\noriginally obtained from the Carcinogenic Potency Database by Gold\net al.41 and some other publications.42−44 Nitrosoureas, nitrosoguanidines, compounds with multiple nitrosamine\ngroups, and nitrosamines without any α-CH2 groups\nwere excluded, resulting in a final set of 84 compounds. The carcinogenic\npotency was expressed as TD50 in units of mg/kg/day. We obtained a list of potential drug substance\nrelated nitrosamines from Schlingemann et al.17 Structures of these NDSRIs were generated by Schlingemann et al.\nfrom a large list of small drug and drug impurities. The original\nlist contained 9862 compounds, which were curated by removing duplicates,\nneutralizing charges, correcting atom type errors, and removing compounds\nwith multiple nitrosamine groups or without α-CH2 groups. This resulted in a final set of 6277 nitrosamines. We encoded the local structural environments of\nactive and inactive CH2 groups of xenobiotics by generating\nsmall molecular fragments with the CH2 group as the starting\npoint (Figure 1). Active\nCH2 groups undergo hydroxylation in substrate–metabolite\npairs, whereas the inactive CH2 groups do not (Figure 1a). The generated\nfragments were used as descriptors in model building. They were also\nused to encode the structural environment of the α-CH2 groups in nitrosamines in the form of fingerprints (see below). The molecular fragment representations (Figure 1b) were produced using an algorithm modified\nfrom one which is used for generating unique SMILES representation,45 resulting in a distinct textual representation.\nThis representation depicts atom attributes such as element type,\nhybridization, aromaticity, number of attached hydrogens, and ring\nmemberships, providing a visually interpretable and information-rich\nencoding of structural information beyond that of conventional SMILES.\nFor example, in the fragment [CR2](=[CR2H]-[CR3H2])-[CR3H2], CR2 represents\na sp2 carbon that lacks any hydrogens in a non-aromatic ring, CR2H\nrepresents a sp2 carbon having one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring,\nand CR3H2 represents a sp3 carbon having two hydrogens in a non-aromatic\nring. We utilized a subset of 620 substrates from the xenobiotic database\nto create a model to predict the likelihood of CYP-mediated hydroxylation\nat CH2 sites. The model building process is depicted in Figure 2. Each CH2 group in a substrate–metabolite pair was considered a data\npoint, resulting in 3530 CH2 sites, with 839 active and\n2691 inactive ones. Active CH2 groups were assigned a label\nof 1, while inactive CH2 groups were labeled 0. These labels\nare similar to the biological activity data (Y) in\na QSAR. The counts of fragment descriptors generated from the local\nenvironment of each CH2 group were used in the X-matrix.\nAny fragment that appeared in less than 5 CH2 groups was\nremoved to prevent overfitting. Process of building a model involves collecting m fragments from the structural environments of n CH2 groups from the xenobiotic training set.\nFollowing\nthe variable selection process, m′ fragments\nremain. The orange and green boxes in the Y-column indicate active\nand inactive CH2 groups, respectively. The X-matrix comprises\ncounts of various fragments (frg1, frg2, etc.). During the regression fitting process,\nthe the regression coefficients (a1, a2, etc.)\nand the regression constant are computed to derive\neq 1, Figure 2, which\nessentially is the model. We also employed a variable selection process to\nidentify fragments\nthat are not relevant to CH2 hydroxylation. For example,\n644 linear fragments up to 4 atoms long were initially generated from\nthe training set, but only 386 fragments survived the variable selection\nprocess. The “R” package glmnet(46,47) was used for this purpose. It combines 10-fold cross-validation\nwith the logistic regression method and generates coefficients for\nthe fragments (a1, a2,...am’ in eq 1, Figure 2). In the resulting model, fragments with positive\ncoefficients were considered favorable for hydroxylation, while negative\ncoefficients were considered inhibitory. To predict metabolic hydroxylation\nprobability of a CH2 group in a query compound, fragments\naround it are generated and matched with model fragments, and a probability\nvalue is computed using eq 1, Figure 2. If any fragments are found outside of the training\nset, they are classified as “uncovered fragments,” and\nthe outcome can be considered as out-of-domain. As the training\ndata set for xenobiotic metabolism does not include instances of N-nitrosamines undergoing α-carbon hydroxylation,\nwe manually added a term for the >N–N=O moiety to\neq\n1, Figure 2, when applying\nit to predict the α-hydroxylation of N-nitrosamines.\nA high coefficient value of +2.00 was assigned to this term to ensure\nthat the nitrosamine moiety always has a constant positive effect\nwhile other groups have a positive or negative modulatory impact on\nthe predicted probability. Moreover, this value yielded a satisfactory\ndistribution of calculated hydroxylation probabilities for nitrosamines,\npreventing extreme values close to 0 or 1. It also counterbalances\nthe negative effects of xenobiotic amine-based fragments on hydroxylation.\nThe Supporting Information provides necessary details. Fingerprints\nwere needed for comparing and clustering nitrosamines based on their\nstructural features relevant to α-CH2 hydroxylation.\nTo do so, a vector containing the same number of slots as there were\nfragments in the X-matrix of the model (i.e., 644) was created. Next,\neach slot of this vector was filled with the corresponding regression\ncoefficients of the fragments from the prior step of modeling CH2-hydroxylation in xenobiotics. Molecular structure handling, curation, molecular\nfragmentation, database operations, metabolism site detection, and\nmodeling were carried out using an in-house cheminformatics software\nlibrary. The cv.glmnet procedure was performed using\nthe “R” package glmnet.(46,47) Clustering was performed using the “R” package rtsne.(48) We have utilized the MultiCASE software QSAR Flex(21,49) to find appropriate analogues for NDSRIs in certain\ncases.\n\n## Xenobiotic Metabolism Data\nWe obtained xenobiotic metabolism\ndata from our in-house database at MultiCASE. This database contains\n16,318 substrate–metabolite pairs with information on enzymes,\norgans, and species, sourced from various publications.39,40 We narrowed down the data set to 620 pairs involving only CH2 hydroxylation (CH2 to CH–OH conversion).\nThe transformations were primarily mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP)\nenzymes.

Example of a xenobiotic substrate undergoing\nmetabolic hydroxylation\nat a CH2 group, (a) CH2 group highlighted with\nan orange circle is the active site, whereas the ones highlighted\nwith the gray circles are inactive CH2 sites, i.e., not\nhydroxylated. (b) Molecular fragments generated from the local environment\n(highlighted with red bonds) of the active CH2 site (C3—sp3 non-ring carbon, C2—sp2 non-ring carbon, CR3—sp3\ncarbon in a non-aromatic ring, CR2—sp2 carbon in a non-aromatic\nring, C3H3—sp3 non-ring carbon with three hydrogens, CR3H—sp3\ncarbon with one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring, CR3H2—sp3\ncarbon with two hydrogens in a non-aromatic ring, and CR2H—sp2\ncarbon with one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring).\n\n## Nitrosamine Carcinogenicity Data\nWe collected a data\nset of nitrosamines with animal carcinogenicity assay outcomes from\nvarious sources, including the publication of Dobo et al.22 and data collected by MultiCASE. The data were\noriginally obtained from the Carcinogenic Potency Database by Gold\net al.41 and some other publications.42−44 Nitrosoureas, nitrosoguanidines, compounds with multiple nitrosamine\ngroups, and nitrosamines without any α-CH2 groups\nwere excluded, resulting in a final set of 84 compounds. The carcinogenic\npotency was expressed as TD50 in units of mg/kg/day.\n\n## NDSRIs\nWe obtained a list of potential drug substance\nrelated nitrosamines from Schlingemann et al.17 Structures of these NDSRIs were generated by Schlingemann et al.\nfrom a large list of small drug and drug impurities. The original\nlist contained 9862 compounds, which were curated by removing duplicates,\nneutralizing charges, correcting atom type errors, and removing compounds\nwith multiple nitrosamine groups or without α-CH2 groups. This resulted in a final set of 6277 nitrosamines.\n\n## Modeling\nWe encoded the local structural environments of\nactive and inactive CH2 groups of xenobiotics by generating\nsmall molecular fragments with the CH2 group as the starting\npoint (Figure 1). Active\nCH2 groups undergo hydroxylation in substrate–metabolite\npairs, whereas the inactive CH2 groups do not (Figure 1a). The generated\nfragments were used as descriptors in model building. They were also\nused to encode the structural environment of the α-CH2 groups in nitrosamines in the form of fingerprints (see below). The molecular fragment representations (Figure 1b) were produced using an algorithm modified\nfrom one which is used for generating unique SMILES representation,45 resulting in a distinct textual representation.\nThis representation depicts atom attributes such as element type,\nhybridization, aromaticity, number of attached hydrogens, and ring\nmemberships, providing a visually interpretable and information-rich\nencoding of structural information beyond that of conventional SMILES.\nFor example, in the fragment [CR2](=[CR2H]-[CR3H2])-[CR3H2], CR2 represents\na sp2 carbon that lacks any hydrogens in a non-aromatic ring, CR2H\nrepresents a sp2 carbon having one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring,\nand CR3H2 represents a sp3 carbon having two hydrogens in a non-aromatic\nring. We utilized a subset of 620 substrates from the xenobiotic database\nto create a model to predict the likelihood of CYP-mediated hydroxylation\nat CH2 sites. The model building process is depicted in Figure 2. Each CH2 group in a substrate–metabolite pair was considered a data\npoint, resulting in 3530 CH2 sites, with 839 active and\n2691 inactive ones. Active CH2 groups were assigned a label\nof 1, while inactive CH2 groups were labeled 0. These labels\nare similar to the biological activity data (Y) in\na QSAR. The counts of fragment descriptors generated from the local\nenvironment of each CH2 group were used in the X-matrix.\nAny fragment that appeared in less than 5 CH2 groups was\nremoved to prevent overfitting. Process of building a model involves collecting m fragments from the structural environments of n CH2 groups from the xenobiotic training set.\nFollowing\nthe variable selection process, m′ fragments\nremain. The orange and green boxes in the Y-column indicate active\nand inactive CH2 groups, respectively. The X-matrix comprises\ncounts of various fragments (frg1, frg2, etc.). During the regression fitting process,\nthe the regression coefficients (a1, a2, etc.)\nand the regression constant are computed to derive\neq 1, Figure 2, which\nessentially is the model. We also employed a variable selection process to\nidentify fragments\nthat are not relevant to CH2 hydroxylation. For example,\n644 linear fragments up to 4 atoms long were initially generated from\nthe training set, but only 386 fragments survived the variable selection\nprocess. The “R” package glmnet(46,47) was used for this purpose. It combines 10-fold cross-validation\nwith the logistic regression method and generates coefficients for\nthe fragments (a1, a2,...am’ in eq 1, Figure 2). In the resulting model, fragments with positive\ncoefficients were considered favorable for hydroxylation, while negative\ncoefficients were considered inhibitory. To predict metabolic hydroxylation\nprobability of a CH2 group in a query compound, fragments\naround it are generated and matched with model fragments, and a probability\nvalue is computed using eq 1, Figure 2. If any fragments are found outside of the training\nset, they are classified as “uncovered fragments,” and\nthe outcome can be considered as out-of-domain. As the training\ndata set for xenobiotic metabolism does not include instances of N-nitrosamines undergoing α-carbon hydroxylation,\nwe manually added a term for the >N–N=O moiety to\neq\n1, Figure 2, when applying\nit to predict the α-hydroxylation of N-nitrosamines.\nA high coefficient value of +2.00 was assigned to this term to ensure\nthat the nitrosamine moiety always has a constant positive effect\nwhile other groups have a positive or negative modulatory impact on\nthe predicted probability. Moreover, this value yielded a satisfactory\ndistribution of calculated hydroxylation probabilities for nitrosamines,\npreventing extreme values close to 0 or 1. It also counterbalances\nthe negative effects of xenobiotic amine-based fragments on hydroxylation.\nThe Supporting Information provides necessary details.\n\n## Descriptors (Capturing Structural Environments of CH\nWe encoded the local structural environments of\nactive and inactive CH2 groups of xenobiotics by generating\nsmall molecular fragments with the CH2 group as the starting\npoint (Figure 1). Active\nCH2 groups undergo hydroxylation in substrate–metabolite\npairs, whereas the inactive CH2 groups do not (Figure 1a). The generated\nfragments were used as descriptors in model building. They were also\nused to encode the structural environment of the α-CH2 groups in nitrosamines in the form of fingerprints (see below). The molecular fragment representations (Figure 1b) were produced using an algorithm modified\nfrom one which is used for generating unique SMILES representation,45 resulting in a distinct textual representation.\nThis representation depicts atom attributes such as element type,\nhybridization, aromaticity, number of attached hydrogens, and ring\nmemberships, providing a visually interpretable and information-rich\nencoding of structural information beyond that of conventional SMILES.\nFor example, in the fragment [CR2](=[CR2H]-[CR3H2])-[CR3H2], CR2 represents\na sp2 carbon that lacks any hydrogens in a non-aromatic ring, CR2H\nrepresents a sp2 carbon having one hydrogen in a non-aromatic ring,\nand CR3H2 represents a sp3 carbon having two hydrogens in a non-aromatic\nring.\n\n## Building Model for CH\nWe utilized a subset of 620 substrates from the xenobiotic database\nto create a model to predict the likelihood of CYP-mediated hydroxylation\nat CH2 sites. The model building process is depicted in Figure 2. Each CH2 group in a substrate–metabolite pair was considered a data\npoint, resulting in 3530 CH2 sites, with 839 active and\n2691 inactive ones. Active CH2 groups were assigned a label\nof 1, while inactive CH2 groups were labeled 0. These labels\nare similar to the biological activity data (Y) in\na QSAR. The counts of fragment descriptors generated from the local\nenvironment of each CH2 group were used in the X-matrix.\nAny fragment that appeared in less than 5 CH2 groups was\nremoved to prevent overfitting. Process of building a model involves collecting m fragments from the structural environments of n CH2 groups from the xenobiotic training set.\nFollowing\nthe variable selection process, m′ fragments\nremain. The orange and green boxes in the Y-column indicate active\nand inactive CH2 groups, respectively. The X-matrix comprises\ncounts of various fragments (frg1, frg2, etc.). During the regression fitting process,\nthe the regression coefficients (a1, a2, etc.)\nand the regression constant are computed to derive\neq 1, Figure 2, which\nessentially is the model. We also employed a variable selection process to\nidentify fragments\nthat are not relevant to CH2 hydroxylation. For example,\n644 linear fragments up to 4 atoms long were initially generated from\nthe training set, but only 386 fragments survived the variable selection\nprocess. The “R” package glmnet(46,47) was used for this purpose. It combines 10-fold cross-validation\nwith the logistic regression method and generates coefficients for\nthe fragments (a1, a2,...am’ in eq 1, Figure 2). In the resulting model, fragments with positive\ncoefficients were considered favorable for hydroxylation, while negative\ncoefficients were considered inhibitory.\n\n## Making Predictions\nTo predict metabolic hydroxylation\nprobability of a CH2 group in a query compound, fragments\naround it are generated and matched with model fragments, and a probability\nvalue is computed using eq 1, Figure 2. If any fragments are found outside of the training\nset, they are classified as “uncovered fragments,” and\nthe outcome can be considered as out-of-domain. As the training\ndata set for xenobiotic metabolism does not include instances of N-nitrosamines undergoing α-carbon hydroxylation,\nwe manually added a term for the >N–N=O moiety to\neq\n1, Figure 2, when applying\nit to predict the α-hydroxylation of N-nitrosamines.\nA high coefficient value of +2.00 was assigned to this term to ensure\nthat the nitrosamine moiety always has a constant positive effect\nwhile other groups have a positive or negative modulatory impact on\nthe predicted probability. Moreover, this value yielded a satisfactory\ndistribution of calculated hydroxylation probabilities for nitrosamines,\npreventing extreme values close to 0 or 1. It also counterbalances\nthe negative effects of xenobiotic amine-based fragments on hydroxylation.\nThe Supporting Information provides necessary details.\n\n## Building Fingerprints for Nitrosamines\nFingerprints\nwere needed for comparing and clustering nitrosamines based on their\nstructural features relevant to α-CH2 hydroxylation.\nTo do so, a vector containing the same number of slots as there were\nfragments in the X-matrix of the model (i.e., 644) was created. Next,\neach slot of this vector was filled with the corresponding regression\ncoefficients of the fragments from the prior step of modeling CH2-hydroxylation in xenobiotics.\n\n## Software\nMolecular structure handling, curation, molecular\nfragmentation, database operations, metabolism site detection, and\nmodeling were carried out using an in-house cheminformatics software\nlibrary. The cv.glmnet procedure was performed using\nthe “R” package glmnet.(46,47) Clustering was performed using the “R” package rtsne.(48) We have utilized the MultiCASE software QSAR Flex(21,49) to find appropriate analogues for NDSRIs in certain\ncases.\n\n## Results and Discussion\nUsing molecular fragments,\nwe compared the diversity of structural environments around CH2 groups that may undergo metabolic hydroxylation in three\ndata sets: (A) 6277 NDSRIs, (B) 620 xenobiotic substrates, and (C)\n84 small molecular weight nitrosamines with available animal carcinogenicity\ndata. Our findings, depicted in Figure 3, demonstrate that structural diversity of small nitrosamines\nis quite limited compared to NDSRIs, with only 118 fragments shared\nbetween them. This finding suggests that small nitrosamines are not\nadequate representatives of the structural diversity of potential\nNDSRIs. Comparison of structural environments of α-CH2 groups\nof NDSRIs, small carcinogenic nitrosamines, and the CH2 groups of the xenobiotic data set, with the aid of unique\nmolecular fragments. (a) Number of fragments at the intersections\nof the three sets and (b) comparison of the sets when they were depicted\nto scale based on the number of fragments. The data set of xenobiotics produced 781 fragments,\nout of which\n525 were also identified in NDSRIs. While this number still does not\nmeet the desired level of diversity, it is much higher compared to\nthe small nitrosamine data set. Additionally, we expect to expand\nthe xenobiotics data set by accessing more data on CH2-hydroxylation.\nHowever, it is unlikely that the nitrosamine carcinogenicity database\nwill grow any further in its current form. To identify\nthe most effective molecular fragment types for predicting CH2 hydroxylation, we conducted cross-validation of models built\nfrom these fragments, including linear, atom-centered, and of different\nsizes with varying information on atom nodes. We performed 10-fold\nleave-many-out cross-validations with the following settings:i.Linear fragments, 3 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.ii.Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.iii.Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.iv.Linear fragments, 7 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.v.Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, no differentiation of aliphatic\nring atoms, and explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.vi.Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (8 or\nsmaller) marked, and no explicit\nhydrogens on aromatic carbons.vii.Atom-centered fragments, 5\natoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and\nno explicit hydrogens on aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 3 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 7 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, no differentiation of aliphatic\nring atoms, and explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (8 or\nsmaller) marked, and no explicit\nhydrogens on aromatic carbons. Atom-centered fragments, 5\natoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and\nno explicit hydrogens on aromatic carbons. Our findings, presented in Figure 4, demonstrate that linear fragments outperform\natom-centered fragments, with the best performance achieved using\nthe 4-atom linear fragments that depict ring size of 8 or smaller.\nWhen used in the N-nitrosamines, 4-atom linear fragments\ncapture structural environment up to a distance of 5 atoms from the\nnitrosamine moiety’s amine nitrogen as the fragments originate\nfrom the α-CH2 group. Different variations\nof fragment settings and their effect on the\nmodel’s CV performance (average ROC-AUC) for predicting xenobiotic\nCH2-hydroxylation. The green bar is the best performing\nfragment setting which was used in subsequent steps (LF—linear\nfragments and ACF—atom centered fragments). The inferior performance of the atom-centered fragments\nis likely\ndue to their more complex structure, resulting in overly specific\nfragments. Our analysis indicates that 4-atom linear fragments are\noptimal as 3-atom fragments do not capture sufficient structural variation,\nand larger fragments offer no additional benefits as features too\nfar away from the CH2 site likely have negligible effects. We utilized molecular\nfragments to represent the structural environment around CH2 groups and assess their impact on hydroxylation. Our model was trained\nusing 3530 CH2 groups, with 839 undergoing hydroxylation\nand 2691 remaining unchanged, identifying 375 fragments that exhibited\nabsolute regression coefficients of at least 0.01, comprising 141\npositive and 234 negative fragments. Notably, when fragments around\nthe α-CH2 groups of nitrosamines were considered,\n291 of the 375 abovementioned xenobiotic fragments overlapped with\nNDSRIs, while only 51 were shared with the small nitrosamines. We\nemployed the 4-atom linear fragments specifying ring atoms of 8 or\nsmaller sized rings as determined from the CV exercise. The Supporting\nInformation contains both a comprehensive list of all the fragments\nwith their corresponding regression coefficients and a compilation\nof the top fragments. The regression coefficients\nfor the fragments relevant to CH2 hydroxylation can be\nutilized to generate fingerprints to represent the structural environments\nof the >N–N=O moiety. We utilized the NDSRIs for\ngenerating\na large set of cyclic and acyclic nitrosamine motifs, fingerprints\nof which were then used for clustering to uncover potential SARs.\nTo ensure independent evaluation of the effects of various features\non the α-CH2 group, we replaced each side chain of\nan acyclic NDSRI with a −CH3 group, one at a time,\nproducing compounds with only one chain containing a α-CH2 group. The cyclic nitrosamines were not altered. This resulted\nin a data set of 1690 acyclic and 1009 cyclic nitrosamines after excluding\nnitrosamines with uncovered fragments. The nitrosamines were clustered\nusing tSNE methodology and color-coded based on their hydroxylation\nprobability (Figures 5 and 6). Tables 1 and 2 list some of\nthe representative structural motifs and their hydroxylation probabilities. Clusters\nof acyclic nitrosamine motifs containing only one α-CH2 with the hydroxylation probability indicated by the color\ncoding. Clusters of cyclic nitrosamine motifs with the α-hydroxylation\nprobability indicated by the color coding. Highest hydroxylation probability\nis taken if two α-CH2 sites exist. Furthermore, we computed α-CH2 hydroxylation\nprobabilities\nfor nitrosamines with various features identified as important by\ndomain experts23 in published articles.\nThe main objective was to determine if the computed probabilities\nalign with the current SAR knowledge. The results are shown in Table 3. Interestingly, the\ncomputed values concurred with expert deductions, except for the impact\nof the β-carbonyl group. We confirmed the deactivating effect\nof the carboxylic acid group19 in the side\nchain within a distance of 4 atoms and observed the boosting effects\nof the benzyl, allyl, and small alkyl chains, which validates expert\nopinions. The hydroxylation value of the β-carbonyl group was\nlower because of fewer active CH2 groups compared to inactive\nCH2 groups adjacent to carbonyl groups in the xenobiotic\nsubstrates. We were unable to compute values for some features due\nto uncovered fragments, e.g., strong electron withdrawing −CF3 group. Such data gaps could potentially be filled by expanding\nthe xenobiotic metabolism data set in the future. Feature exists in xenobiotics next\nto a CH2 group without a N-nitroso group. Feature exists in NDSRIs next\nto\na CH2 group which is “alpha” to a N-nitroso group. Nonetheless, the clustering exercise (refer to Figures 5 and 6) yielded very valuable information on the quantitative effects\nof\na significantly greater number of NDSRI features than those identified\nby experts to date.23,24 It also provides useful structure–activity\nrelations, for example as shown in Table 1, varying effects of aromatic rings at β\nposition, a benzylic side chain (cluster #6) yields a probability\nof 0.55, but the 3-methylene pyridine version has a slightly lower\nprobability (0.49, cluster #8), whereas, the 2-methylene thiophene\nand the 2-methylene pyridine give significantly higher values of 0.81\n(cluster #1) and 0.82 (cluster #2), respectively. Similarly as shown\nin Table 2, various\nfeatures for cyclic nitrosamines were also identified. For example,\npresence of an aromatic ring within a distance of 1, 2, or 3 atoms\nfrom the >N–N=O moiety increases the probability\nof\nα-hydroxylation (clusters #1 and 3–5), whereas, substitution\non the α-position on any side decreases the probability, e.g.,\nclusters #6 and 7. This observation corroborates previous publications\nthat steric hindrance on the α-carbon inhibits the metabolic\nactivation of nitrosamines.23,24,50 Additionally, presence of a nitrogen in the ring at the 3-position\ndecreases the probability of α-hydroxylation. This can be observed\nin clusters #8 and 9. We predicted the likelihood of hydroxylation\nfor 21 nitrosamines with reliable carcinogenicity TD50 data\n(Lhasa TD5051,52). Maximum value was taken in\nthe case of two α-CH2 groups. Uncovered fragments\nwere identified in seven nitrosamines, results for the rest are shown\nin Figure 7, in which\nno apparent correlation was observed between the predicted hydroxylation\nand the carcinogenic potency. Factors other than hydroxylation, such\nas reactivity of the diazonium intermediate or alternate metabolic\npathways, may explain this lack of correlation. Nitrosamines with\nlow reactivity of the diazonium intermediate can be less carcinogenic\neven after rapid hydroxylation. Carcinogenic potency compared to the probability\nof α-CH2 hydroxylation of 14 small nitrosamines.\nThe orange dot corresponds\nto N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA). To further\nexplore the relationship between carcinogenic potency and α-hydroxylation,\nwe built a QSAR model directly using the carcinogenic potencies (−Log\nTD50) of 84 small nitrosamines and fragments around their\nα-CH2 groups as descriptors. As a result, 15 fragments\nwere identified that positively or negatively affect carcinogenicity\npotency and we compared their regression coefficients to those obtained\nfrom modeling xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation. Table 4 shows that out of the 15 fragments,\n14 were also found in the xenobiotic data set. Interestingly, three\nfragments with positive effects on carcinogenicity also had a positive\neffect on xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation and four with negative\ninfluence on carcinogenicity had a negative effect on xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation too. Particularly noteworthy is the fragment\n[C3H2]-[N3]-[C3H3], which demonstrated conflicting contributions.\nWhile being part of the >N–N=O moiety of methyl nitrosamines\nin the carcinogenicity data set led to its expected positive contribution\ntoward carcinogenicity, it had a negative coefficient in xenobiotic\nhydroxylation because of being a part of tertiary amines that apparently\nexert a negative effect on CH2-hydroxylation. Despite the\nlimited size of the nitrosamine data set, our findings provide compelling\nevidence that certain structural features that modulate CH2 hydroxylation in xenobiotics also have similar effects on the carcinogenic\npotency of nitrosamines. The CH2 site is highlighted\nin red. Establishing\nAI limits for complex N-nitrosamines in the absence\nof animal carcinogenicity data poses a critical challenge.23 While read-across using analogues is a common\npractice,21 selecting a single analogue\nfor AI elucidation remains difficult. It is therefore important to\nperform a critical analysis of the analogues’ structural features\nin relation to the query as molecular similarity measures alone are\ninsufficient. The predictive model built in this study is a\nvaluable tool for identifying small analogues by comparing their α-hydroxylation\npotential to the query N-nitrosamine. Also, structural\nfragments that are pertinent to α-hydroxylation can be used\nto assess the reliability of these analogues as “uncovered\nfragments” in close proximity to the nitrosamine moiety of\nthe analogues or absence of crucial fragments relative to the query\nnitrosamine should be deemed less reliable and consequently can be\nconsidered for exclusion. The methodology is demonstrated through\nsome examples below, highlighting\nthe importance of careful selection of analogues for the establishment\nof AI limits for complex N-nitrosamines. In this study,\nwe applied the calculation of the likelihood of α-hydroxylation\nto the N-nitroso derivative of varenicline and three\nrelated N-nitrosamine analogues (NPIP, NHEX, and\nNTHP) with available carcinogenicity data (Figure 8). The analogues are taken from a recent\npublication by Ponting et al.23 The predicted\nhydroxylation values for N-nitroso varenicline, NPIP,\nand NHEX were 0.63, 0.56, and 0.56, respectively. Notably, the hydroxylation\nvalues for NPIP and NHEX were identical despite their differing ring\nsizes due to our modeling process treating rings of size 5–8\nequally. Application of α-hydroxylation computation on N-nitroso varenicline and its structurally similar analogues for establishing\na daily AI limit. α-CH2 groups are shown with orange\ncircles (Pα-hydrox—computed probability of α-hydroxylation\nand NC—not calculated due to the presence of uncovered fragments). The AI limit for N-nitroso varenicline\nhas been\nset at 37 ng/day by several regulatory agencies, who have used NTHP\nas a surrogate to determine the appropriate threshold.53−55 However, the α-hydroxylation value for NTHP could not be reliably\ncalculated due to the presence of “uncovered fragments”\nnear the nitrosamine moiety resulting from the presence of unsaturation\nin the ring, indicating its structural dissimilarity to N-nitroso varenicline, NPIP, and NHEX. Conversely, NPIP and NHEX exhibited\nhydroxylation values comparable to N-nitroso varenicline\nand are deemed suitable surrogates for deriving the AI limit, consistent\nwith the opinion of Ponting et al. As a conservative measure, we can\nselect NHEX as the surrogate for AI derivation. According to Ponting\net al.,23 the AI limit was established\nas 110 ng/day using the TD50 of NHEX from the most sensitive\ntumorigenic site (TD50 = 0.110 mg/kg/day). In this study,\nwe aimed to assess the potential carcinogenicity of N-nitroso nortriptyline by comparing its α-hydroxylation potential\nwith that of the three structurally related analogues identified by\nthe QSAR Flex software program (Figure 9). QSAR Flex utilizes a database of small nitrosamines with carcinogenicity data\nto match different atom types around the nitrosamine moiety for identifying\nsuitable analogues. Application of α-hydroxylation computation on N-nitroso nortriptyline and its structurally similar analogues.\nα-CH2 groups are shown with orange circles (Pα-hydrox—computed\nprobability of α-hydroxylation). It is noteworthy that several regulatory agencies,\nincluding Health\nCanada55 and the EMA,54 have established an extremely low AI limit of 8 ng/day\nfor N-nitroso nortriptyline based on the TD50 of 0.008 mg/kg/day for N-nitroso methylphenethyl\namine. However, our findings raise a question about the appropriateness\nof such a low AI limit for this particular NDSRI, given its relatively\nlow α-hydroxylation value of only 0.07, in comparison to the\nhigher values observed for the three analogues, including N-nitroso methylphenethyl amine. Despite experimental\nevidence indicating that the primary clearance pathway for the selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine involves metabolic modification\nof the 1,3-benzdioxole ring and that no metabolites resulting from\nα-carbon hydroxylation after a possible nitrosation of the piperidine\nring were observed in humans,23 we conducted\nthis case study to evaluate the potential carcinogenicity of N-nitroso paroxetine to account for the theoretical possibility\nof its introduction via external sources, e.g., as an impurity. Specifically,\nwe aimed to compare its α-hydroxylation potential with that\nof three structurally related analogues (Figure 10). Application of α-hydroxylation computation\non N-nitroso paroxetine and its structurally similar\nanalogues. α-CH2 groups are shown with orange circles\n(Pα-hydrox—computed\nprobability of α-hydroxylation). Our results revealed that N-nitroso\nparoxetine\nexhibited a significantly higher α-hydroxylation potential of\n0.86 than two of its analogues, nitrosopiperdinol (0.61) and nitrosopiperidine\n(0.56). Conversely, 1-nitroso-3-pyrrolidinol, the third analogue,\ndemonstrated a slightly higher hydroxylation potential (0.78) than\nthe other two analogues; however, its 5-membered ring structure, which\nis more constrained, may explain its higher TD50 value.\nGiven the potential risks associated with nitrosamine impurities where\nutmost caution is warranted, utilizing these analogues to establish\nAI level for N-nitroso paroxetine is inadvisable.\nAdditional investigations are imperative to explore alternative methods\nfor assessing the safety of N-nitroso paroxetine. While our study presented\na promising method for predicting the probability of metabolic α-carbon\nhydroxylation of N-nitrosamines, there are several\nlimitations that should be considered when interpreting the outcomes\nof this methodology.1.The developed model is only applicable\nto nitrosamines that contain at least one α-CH2 group.\nHowever, this limitation can potentially be addressed by creating\nsimilar models for α-CH and α-CH3 groups by utilizing\nxenobiotic metabolism data. This would allow us to expand the coverage\nof NDSRIs and identify new features.2.While the model we developed represents\na significant improvement over relying solely on a small carcinogenic\nnitrosamine database, it still identifies “uncovered features”\nin some query nitrosamines, which can lead to unreliable predictions.\nThis is similar to the out-of-domain outcomes that are commonly encountered\nin QSAR models and can be addressed by collecting and utilizing a\nmore extensive range of xenobiotic metabolism data to improve the\nmodel’s coverage.3.Our study suggests that predicting\nα-carbon hydroxylation alone may not be sufficient for accurately\nassessing the carcinogenic potential of NDSRIs since we found little\noverall correlation between predicted α-CH2 hydroxylation\nand the TD50 values of the experimental test set. Other\nfactors, such as the reactivity of the resulting diazonium intermediate\nand various alternative metabolic clearance routes, can significantly\nimpact their carcinogenic potency. These factors require careful scrutiny\nin the risk assessment of NDSRIs.4.Furthermore, this approach may not\nfully capture the metabolic chemistry unique to nitrosamines. Specifically,\nour method does not consider any intramolecular rearrangements involving\nthe nitrosamine moiety that may occur during α-hydroxylation.\nThis limitation highlights the need for further research.5.The accuracy of our α-hydroxylation\nprediction model is entirely reliant on the xenobiotic metabolism\ndata, particularly the substrate–metabolite pairs. Any spontaneous\nrearrangement that obstructs the detection of the newly added OH group\nor omission of reporting intermediate hydroxylation products may likely\nimpact the results. The developed model is only applicable\nto nitrosamines that contain at least one α-CH2 group.\nHowever, this limitation can potentially be addressed by creating\nsimilar models for α-CH and α-CH3 groups by utilizing\nxenobiotic metabolism data. This would allow us to expand the coverage\nof NDSRIs and identify new features.

Other\nfactors, such as the reactivity of the resulting diazonium intermediate\nand various alternative metabolic clearance routes, can significantly\nimpact their carcinogenic potency. These factors require careful scrutiny\nin the risk assessment of NDSRIs. Furthermore, this approach may not\nfully capture the metabolic chemistry unique to nitrosamines. Specifically,\nour method does not consider any intramolecular rearrangements involving\nthe nitrosamine moiety that may occur during α-hydroxylation.\nThis limitation highlights the need for further research. The accuracy of our α-hydroxylation\nprediction model is entirely reliant on the xenobiotic metabolism\ndata, particularly the substrate–metabolite pairs. Any spontaneous\nrearrangement that obstructs the detection of the newly added OH group\nor omission of reporting intermediate hydroxylation products may likely\nimpact the results.\n\n## Comparing Structural Environments of Potentially Reactive CH\nUsing molecular fragments,\nwe compared the diversity of structural environments around CH2 groups that may undergo metabolic hydroxylation in three\ndata sets: (A) 6277 NDSRIs, (B) 620 xenobiotic substrates, and (C)\n84 small molecular weight nitrosamines with available animal carcinogenicity\ndata. Our findings, depicted in Figure 3, demonstrate that structural diversity of small nitrosamines\nis quite limited compared to NDSRIs, with only 118 fragments shared\nbetween them. This finding suggests that small nitrosamines are not\nadequate representatives of the structural diversity of potential\nNDSRIs. Comparison of structural environments of α-CH2 groups\nof NDSRIs, small carcinogenic nitrosamines, and the CH2 groups of the xenobiotic data set, with the aid of unique\nmolecular fragments. (a) Number of fragments at the intersections\nof the three sets and (b) comparison of the sets when they were depicted\nto scale based on the number of fragments. The data set of xenobiotics produced 781 fragments,\nout of which\n525 were also identified in NDSRIs. While this number still does not\nmeet the desired level of diversity, it is much higher compared to\nthe small nitrosamine data set. Additionally, we expect to expand\nthe xenobiotics data set by accessing more data on CH2-hydroxylation.\nHowever, it is unlikely that the nitrosamine carcinogenicity database\nwill grow any further in its current form.\n\n## Evaluating Various Molecular Fragment Types\nTo identify\nthe most effective molecular fragment types for predicting CH2 hydroxylation, we conducted cross-validation of models built\nfrom these fragments, including linear, atom-centered, and of different\nsizes with varying information on atom nodes. We performed 10-fold\nleave-many-out cross-validations with the following settings:i.Linear fragments, 3 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.ii.Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.iii.Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.iv.Linear fragments, 7 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.v.Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, no differentiation of aliphatic\nring atoms, and explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons.vi.Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (8 or\nsmaller) marked, and no explicit\nhydrogens on aromatic carbons.vii.Atom-centered fragments, 5\natoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and\nno explicit hydrogens on aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 3 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 7 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms\n(6 or smaller) marked, and no explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 5 atoms long, no differentiation of aliphatic\nring atoms, and explicit hydrogens\non aromatic carbons. Linear fragments, 4 atoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (8 or\nsmaller) marked, and no explicit\nhydrogens on aromatic carbons. Atom-centered fragments, 5\natoms long, aliphatic ring atoms (6 or smaller) marked, and\nno explicit hydrogens on aromatic carbons. Our findings, presented in Figure 4, demonstrate that linear fragments outperform\natom-centered fragments, with the best performance achieved using\nthe 4-atom linear fragments that depict ring size of 8 or smaller.\nWhen used in the N-nitrosamines, 4-atom linear fragments\ncapture structural environment up to a distance of 5 atoms from the\nnitrosamine moiety’s amine nitrogen as the fragments originate\nfrom the α-CH2 group. Different variations\nof fragment settings and their effect on the\nmodel’s CV performance (average ROC-AUC) for predicting xenobiotic\nCH2-hydroxylation. The green bar is the best performing\nfragment setting which was used in subsequent steps (LF—linear\nfragments and ACF—atom centered fragments). The inferior performance of the atom-centered fragments\nis likely\ndue to their more complex structure, resulting in overly specific\nfragments. Our analysis indicates that 4-atom linear fragments are\noptimal as 3-atom fragments do not capture sufficient structural variation,\nand larger fragments offer no additional benefits as features too\nfar away from the CH2 site likely have negligible effects.\n\n## Exploring Structural Characteristics That Influence Metabolic\nCH\nWe utilized molecular\nfragments to represent the structural environment around CH2 groups and assess their impact on hydroxylation. Our model was trained\nusing 3530 CH2 groups, with 839 undergoing hydroxylation\nand 2691 remaining unchanged, identifying 375 fragments that exhibited\nabsolute regression coefficients of at least 0.01, comprising 141\npositive and 234 negative fragments. Notably, when fragments around\nthe α-CH2 groups of nitrosamines were considered,\n291 of the 375 abovementioned xenobiotic fragments overlapped with\nNDSRIs, while only 51 were shared with the small nitrosamines. We\nemployed the 4-atom linear fragments specifying ring atoms of 8 or\nsmaller sized rings as determined from the CV exercise. The Supporting\nInformation contains both a comprehensive list of all the fragments\nwith their corresponding regression coefficients and a compilation\nof the top fragments.\n\n## Assessing α-CH\nThe regression coefficients\nfor the fragments relevant to CH2 hydroxylation can be\nutilized to generate fingerprints to represent the structural environments\nof the >N–N=O moiety. We utilized the NDSRIs for\ngenerating\na large set of cyclic and acyclic nitrosamine motifs, fingerprints\nof which were then used for clustering to uncover potential SARs.\nTo ensure independent evaluation of the effects of various features\non the α-CH2 group, we replaced each side chain of\nan acyclic NDSRI with a −CH3 group, one at a time,\nproducing compounds with only one chain containing a α-CH2 group. The cyclic nitrosamines were not altered. This resulted\nin a data set of 1690 acyclic and 1009 cyclic nitrosamines after excluding\nnitrosamines with uncovered fragments. The nitrosamines were clustered\nusing tSNE methodology and color-coded based on their hydroxylation\nprobability (Figures 5 and 6). Tables 1 and 2 list some of\nthe representative structural motifs and their hydroxylation probabilities. Clusters\nof acyclic nitrosamine motifs containing only one α-CH2 with the hydroxylation probability indicated by the color\ncoding. Clusters of cyclic nitrosamine motifs with the α-hydroxylation\nprobability indicated by the color coding. Highest hydroxylation probability\nis taken if two α-CH2 sites exist. Furthermore, we computed α-CH2 hydroxylation\nprobabilities\nfor nitrosamines with various features identified as important by\ndomain experts23 in published articles.\nThe main objective was to determine if the computed probabilities\nalign with the current SAR knowledge. The results are shown in Table 3. Interestingly, the\ncomputed values concurred with expert deductions, except for the impact\nof the β-carbonyl group. We confirmed the deactivating effect\nof the carboxylic acid group19 in the side\nchain within a distance of 4 atoms and observed the boosting effects\nof the benzyl, allyl, and small alkyl chains, which validates expert\nopinions. The hydroxylation value of the β-carbonyl group was\nlower because of fewer active CH2 groups compared to inactive\nCH2 groups adjacent to carbonyl groups in the xenobiotic\nsubstrates. We were unable to compute values for some features due\nto uncovered fragments, e.g., strong electron withdrawing −CF3 group. Such data gaps could potentially be filled by expanding\nthe xenobiotic metabolism data set in the future. Feature exists in xenobiotics next\nto a CH2 group without a N-nitroso group. Feature exists in NDSRIs next\nto\na CH2 group which is “alpha” to a N-nitroso group. Nonetheless, the clustering exercise (refer to Figures 5 and 6) yielded very valuable information on the quantitative effects\nof\na significantly greater number of NDSRI features than those identified\nby experts to date.23,24 It also provides useful structure–activity\nrelations, for example as shown in Table 1, varying effects of aromatic rings at β\nposition, a benzylic side chain (cluster #6) yields a probability\nof 0.55, but the 3-methylene pyridine version has a slightly lower\nprobability (0.49, cluster #8), whereas, the 2-methylene thiophene\nand the 2-methylene pyridine give significantly higher values of 0.81\n(cluster #1) and 0.82 (cluster #2), respectively. Similarly as shown\nin Table 2, various\nfeatures for cyclic nitrosamines were also identified. For example,\npresence of an aromatic ring within a distance of 1, 2, or 3 atoms\nfrom the >N–N=O moiety increases the probability\nof\nα-hydroxylation (clusters #1 and 3–5), whereas, substitution\non the α-position on any side decreases the probability, e.g.,\nclusters #6 and 7. This observation corroborates previous publications\nthat steric hindrance on the α-carbon inhibits the metabolic\nactivation of nitrosamines.23,24,50 Additionally, presence of a nitrogen in the ring at the 3-position\ndecreases the probability of α-hydroxylation. This can be observed\nin clusters #8 and 9.\n\n## Relationship between α-CH\nWe predicted the likelihood of hydroxylation\nfor 21 nitrosamines with reliable carcinogenicity TD50 data\n(Lhasa TD5051,52). Maximum value was taken in\nthe case of two α-CH2 groups. Uncovered fragments\nwere identified in seven nitrosamines, results for the rest are shown\nin Figure 7, in which\nno apparent correlation was observed between the predicted hydroxylation\nand the carcinogenic potency. Factors other than hydroxylation, such\nas reactivity of the diazonium intermediate or alternate metabolic\npathways, may explain this lack of correlation. Nitrosamines with\nlow reactivity of the diazonium intermediate can be less carcinogenic\neven after rapid hydroxylation. Carcinogenic potency compared to the probability\nof α-CH2 hydroxylation of 14 small nitrosamines.\nThe orange dot corresponds\nto N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA).\n\n## Identifying Common Structural Features That Contribute to Both\nα-Hydroxylation and Carcinogenic Potency\nTo further\nexplore the relationship between carcinogenic potency and α-hydroxylation,\nwe built a QSAR model directly using the carcinogenic potencies (−Log\nTD50) of 84 small nitrosamines and fragments around their\nα-CH2 groups as descriptors. As a result, 15 fragments\nwere identified that positively or negatively affect carcinogenicity\npotency and we compared their regression coefficients to those obtained\nfrom modeling xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation. Table 4 shows that out of the 15 fragments,\n14 were also found in the xenobiotic data set. Interestingly, three\nfragments with positive effects on carcinogenicity also had a positive\neffect on xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation and four with negative\ninfluence on carcinogenicity had a negative effect on xenobiotic CH2 hydroxylation too. Particularly noteworthy is the fragment\n[C3H2]-[N3]-[C3H3], which demonstrated conflicting contributions.\nWhile being part of the >N–N=O moiety of methyl nitrosamines\nin the carcinogenicity data set led to its expected positive contribution\ntoward carcinogenicity, it had a negative coefficient in xenobiotic\nhydroxylation because of being a part of tertiary amines that apparently\nexert a negative effect on CH2-hydroxylation. Despite the\nlimited size of the nitrosamine data set, our findings provide compelling\nevidence that certain structural features that modulate CH2 hydroxylation in xenobiotics also have similar effects on the carcinogenic\npotency of nitrosamines. The CH2 site is highlighted\nin red.\n\n## Analogue Selection To Establish Daily AI Limits\nEstablishing\nAI limits for complex N-nitrosamines in the absence\nof animal carcinogenicity data poses a critical challenge.23 While read-across using analogues is a common\npractice,21 selecting a single analogue\nfor AI elucidation remains difficult. It is therefore important to\nperform a critical analysis of the analogues’ structural features\nin relation to the query as molecular similarity measures alone are\ninsufficient. The predictive model built in this study is a\nvaluable tool for identifying small analogues by comparing their α-hydroxylation\npotential to the query N-nitrosamine. Also, structural\nfragments that are pertinent to α-hydroxylation can be used\nto assess the reliability of these analogues as “uncovered\nfragments” in close proximity to the nitrosamine moiety of\nthe analogues or absence of crucial fragments relative to the query\nnitrosamine should be deemed less reliable and consequently can be\nconsidered for exclusion. The methodology is demonstrated through\nsome examples below, highlighting\nthe importance of careful selection of analogues for the establishment\nof AI limits for complex N-nitrosamines. In this study,\nwe applied the calculation of the likelihood of α-hydroxylation\nto the N-nitroso derivative of varenicline and three\nrelated N-nitrosamine analogues (NPIP, NHEX, and\nNTHP) with available carcinogenicity data (Figure 8). The analogues are taken from a recent\npublication by Ponting et al.23 The predicted\nhydroxylation values for N-nitroso varenicline, NPIP,\nand NHEX were 0.63, 0.56, and 0.56, respectively. Notably, the hydroxylation\nvalues for NPIP and NHEX were identical despite their differing ring\nsizes due to our modeling process treating rings of size 5–8\nequally. Application of α-hydroxylation computation on N-nitroso varenicline and its structurally similar analogues for establishing\na daily AI limit. α-CH2 groups are shown with orange\ncircles (Pα-hydrox—computed probability of α-hydroxylation\nand NC—not calculated due to the presence of uncovered fragments). The AI limit for N-nitroso varenicline\nhas been\nset at 37 ng/day by several regulatory agencies, who have used NTHP\nas a surrogate to determine the appropriate threshold.53−55 However, the α-hydroxylation value for NTHP could not be reliably\ncalculated due to the presence of “uncovered fragments”\nnear the nitrosamine moiety resulting from the presence of unsaturation\nin the ring, indicating its structural dissimilarity to N-nitroso varenicline, NPIP, and NHEX. Conversely, NPIP and NHEX exhibited\nhydroxylation values comparable to N-nitroso varenicline\nand are deemed suitable surrogates for deriving the AI limit, consistent\nwith the opinion of Ponting et al. As a conservative measure, we can\nselect NHEX as the surrogate for AI derivation. According to Ponting\net al.,23 the AI limit was established\nas 110 ng/day using the TD50 of NHEX from the most sensitive\ntumorigenic site (TD50 = 0.110 mg/kg/day). In this study,\nwe aimed to assess the potential carcinogenicity of N-nitroso nortriptyline by comparing its α-hydroxylation potential\nwith that of the three structurally related analogues identified by\nthe QSAR Flex software program (Figure 9). QSAR Flex utilizes a database of small nitrosamines with carcinogenicity data\nto match different atom types around the nitrosamine moiety for identifying\nsuitable analogues. Application of α-hydroxylation computation on N-nitroso nortriptyline and its structurally similar analogues.\nα-CH2 groups are shown with orange circles (Pα-hydrox—computed\nprobability of α-hydroxylation). It is noteworthy that several regulatory agencies,\nincluding Health\nCanada55 and the EMA,54 have established an extremely low AI limit of 8 ng/day\nfor N-nitroso nortriptyline based on the TD50 of 0.008 mg/kg/day for N-nitroso methylphenethyl\namine. However, our findings raise a question about the appropriateness\nof such a low AI limit for this particular NDSRI, given its relatively\nlow α-hydroxylation value of only 0.07, in comparison to the\nhigher values observed for the three analogues, including N-nitroso methylphenethyl amine. Despite experimental\nevidence indicating that the primary clearance pathway for the selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine involves metabolic modification\nof the 1,3-benzdioxole ring and that no metabolites resulting from\nα-carbon hydroxylation after a possible nitrosation of the piperidine\nring were observed in humans,23 we conducted\nthis case study to evaluate the potential carcinogenicity of N-nitroso paroxetine to account for the theoretical possibility\nof its introduction via external sources, e.g., as an impurity.

Conversely, 1-nitroso-3-pyrrolidinol, the third analogue,\ndemonstrated a slightly higher hydroxylation potential (0.78) than\nthe other two analogues; however, its 5-membered ring structure, which\nis more constrained, may explain its higher TD50 value.\nGiven the potential risks associated with nitrosamine impurities where\nutmost caution is warranted, utilizing these analogues to establish\nAI level for N-nitroso paroxetine is inadvisable.\nAdditional investigations are imperative to explore alternative methods\nfor assessing the safety of N-nitroso paroxetine.\n\n## None\nIn this study,\nwe applied the calculation of the likelihood of α-hydroxylation\nto the N-nitroso derivative of varenicline and three\nrelated N-nitrosamine analogues (NPIP, NHEX, and\nNTHP) with available carcinogenicity data (Figure 8).

This would allow us to expand the coverage\nof NDSRIs and identify new features.2.While the model we developed represents\na significant improvement over relying solely on a small carcinogenic\nnitrosamine database, it still identifies “uncovered features”\nin some query nitrosamines, which can lead to unreliable predictions.\nThis is similar to the out-of-domain outcomes that are commonly encountered\nin QSAR models and can be addressed by collecting and utilizing a\nmore extensive range of xenobiotic metabolism data to improve the\nmodel’s coverage.3.Our study suggests that predicting\nα-carbon hydroxylation alone may not be sufficient for accurately\nassessing the carcinogenic potential of NDSRIs since we found little\noverall correlation between predicted α-CH2 hydroxylation\nand the TD50 values of the experimental test set.

These factors require careful scrutiny\nin the risk assessment of NDSRIs.4.Furthermore, this approach may not\nfully capture the metabolic chemistry unique to nitrosamines. Specifically,\nour method does not consider any intramolecular rearrangements involving\nthe nitrosamine moiety that may occur during α-hydroxylation.\nThis limitation highlights the need for further research.5.The accuracy of our α-hydroxylation\nprediction model is entirely reliant on the xenobiotic metabolism\ndata, particularly the substrate–metabolite pairs.

To achieve\nthis, we utilized substrate–metabolite pairs of non-nitrosamine\nxenobiotics to build models for CH2-hydroxylation and made\nheadway in addressing the challenge of limited animal carcinogenicity\ndata availability for assessing the carcinogenic potential of untested\nnitrosamines. Our study revealed that the computed importance\nof molecular fragments\naround α-CH2 groups could be used to construct fingerprints\nfor nitrosamines, enabling effective clustering and identification\nof key features that illuminate the SARs of α-carbon hydroxylation.\nBy expanding the set of statistically significant structural features\nthat may potentially affect the α-hydroxylation step, our study\nenhances our ability to assess complex NDSRIs. It is worth noting\nthat our study showed little overall correlation\nbetween predicted α-CH2 hydroxylation and the overall\nTD50 for the experimental test set. This suggests that\npredicting the α-carbon hydroxylation probability alone may\nnot be sufficient for accurately assessing the carcinogenic potential\nof NDSRIs. However, we did find that the relative contributions of\nmolecular fragments related to α-carbon hydroxylation overlapped\nwith fragment contributions to nitrosamine carcinogenic potency despite\nthe lack of direct correlation between predicted α-carbon hydroxylation\nprobabilities and carcinogenic potency. This suggests that our approach\nmay provide a valuable complement to the read across method for predicting\nthe carcinogenic potential of NDSRIs. Also, comparison of prediction\nperformance of fragments of different lengths indicates that structural\nfeatures beyond 4 atoms offer no additional benefits, an important\nconsideration in developing SARs and analogue selection. Finally,\nour study demonstrated that the small data set of nitrosamines\nwith available carcinogenicity data is insufficient to represent the\nstructural diversity of NDSRIs. However, by predicting α-carbon\nhydroxylation, we can narrow down the list of analogues for establishing\ndaily AI limits, improving the accuracy and reliability of risk assessment\nfor nitrosamines. Overall, our study provides a promising framework\nfor advancing the risk assessment of nitrosamines.",
