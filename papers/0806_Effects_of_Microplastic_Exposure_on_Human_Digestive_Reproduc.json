  "abstract": "Microplastics are ubiquitous environmental contaminants\nfor which\nthere are documented human exposures, but there is a paucity of research\nevaluating their impacts on human health. We conducted a rapid systematic\nreview using the “Navigation Guide” systematic review\nmethod. We searched four databases in July 2022 and April 2024 with\nno restriction on the date. We included studies using predefined eligibility\ncriteria that quantitatively examined the association of microplastic\nexposure with any health outcomes. We amended the eligibility criteria\nafter screening studies and prioritized digestive, reproductive,\nand respiratory outcomes for further evaluation. We included three\nhuman observational studies examining reproductive (n = 2) and respiratory (n = 1) outcomes and 28 animal\nstudies examining reproductive (n = 11), respiratory\n(n = 7), and digestive (n = 10)\noutcomes. For reproductive outcomes (sperm quality) and digestive\noutcomes (immunosuppresion) we rated overall body evidence as “high”\nquality and concluded microplastic exposure is “suspected”\nto adversely impact them. For reproductive outcomes (female follicles\nand reproductive hormones), digestive outcomes (gross or microanatomic\ncolon/small intestine effects, alters cell proliferation and cell\ndeath, and chronic inflammation), and respiratory outcomes (pulmonary\nfunction, lung injury, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress)\nwe rated the overall body of evidence as “moderate”\nquality and concluded microplastic exposure is “suspected”\nto adversely impact them. We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “unclassifiable” for birth outcomes and gestational\nage in humans on the basis of the “low” and “very\nlow” quality of the evidence. We concluded that microplastics\nare “suspected” to harm human reproductive, digestive,\nand respiratory health, with a suggested link to colon and lung cancer.\nFuture research on microplastics should investigate additional health\noutcomes impacted by microplastic exposure and identify strategies\nto reduce exposure.",

      "text": "In 2019, 460 million metric tons of plastic\nwere produced,1 with estimates that production\nwill triple by\n2060.1,2 The largest proportion of plastic production\ncomes from single-use plastics, and 98% of single-use plastics are\nderived from fossil fuels.3 Fossil fuels\nare used to make petrochemicals, a broad and diverse group of chemicals\nthat are the feedstock for the production of plastics.4 The petrochemical industry is pivoting to ramp up the production\nof plastics given expectations that the sales of oil and gas will\ndecrease.5,6 This has raised concern, as the production\nof plastics also contributes to greenhouse gases across their life\ncycle from cradle to grave.3,7 In addition, there is\nwell-established evidence from authoritative or systematic reviews\non the human health effects of plasticizers and plastics-related chemicals.8 For example, phthalates can increase the risk\nof preterm birth9 and adverse male reproductive\neffects10 and bisphenol A (BPA) exposure\nis likely or very likely to be a hazard for immunotoxicity, metabolic\neffects, neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity, female reproductive\ntoxicity, male reproductive toxicity, and carcinogenicity.11 Microplastics are defined as plastic particles\nthat are <5000\nμm in size and can be further classified as primary or secondary\ndepending on their source.12 Primary microplastics\nare those that are intentionally produced to serve a specific function,\nfor example, as microbeads used for exfoliation in cosmetic products.13 Secondary microplastics, in contrast, are the\nbreakdown products of larger plastic debris and can be generated by\nphysical, chemical, or biological processes. Secondary microplastics\nare more prevalent in the environment and can include, for example,\nthe microfibers that degrade from car tires, plastic bottles, and\nclothing.14 Like bulk plastic, microplastics\ncan also be a variety of polymers with different physical and chemical\nproperties.15 Microplastics are widespread\nand mobile in the environment, being\ndetected in air, surface water, costal beaches, sediment, and food.14,16,17 They have been discovered in\nremote and pristine locations, including the Antarctic,18 deep ocean trenches,19 and Arctic sea ice.20 Due to their small\nsize, microplastics more easily enter and are distributed in the human\nbody in comparison to larger particles;21 microplastics have been measured in human placenta,22 breastmilk,23 and liver.24 It has been estimated that humans consume a\n“credit card worth” of microplastics every week.25,26 Due to ubiquitous exposure23 and bioaccumulative\ncharacteristics of microplastics,17 the\nextent of human health impacts due to microplastic exposure is of\ngreat concern. Research on microplastics and their health effects\non humans is\nstill in its infancy. A growing body of evidence exists, however,\nindicating the adverse health effects of microplastic exposure on\nliving organisms.16 For example, microplastics\nincrease the susceptibility of fish and seabirds to infections.27,28 Microplastics have also been shown to accumulate in organs and lead\nto biological changes, including oxidative stress and inflammation\nin human cell lines,29,30 and exposure to microplastics\nhas been linked to poor cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes, metabolic\ndisorders, gastrointestinal effects, reproductive effects, and cancer\nin humans.29−36 Evaluations of the human health effects of microplastics have\nbeen\nnarrative nonsystematic reviews, not systematic reviews that assess\nboth the quality and strength of the existing evidence, using rigorous,\npredefined, transparent methods that minimize bias and provide a bottom\nline summary of the evidence.29−33,37 These narrative reviews, therefore,\nare able to speculate about only the association between microplastic\nexposure and human health outcomes as they do not follow prespecified,\nconsistently applied, and transparent rules like those utilized by\nsystematic reviews. Systematic reviews are thus needed to provide\nmore confidence in the evaluation of the relationship between microplastic\nexposure and health effects and to provide a conclusive statement\nregarding the implications for human toxicity. Given the growing\nbody of evidence, as well as the urgent need\nto better characterize the effects of microplastic exposure on human\nhealth, we were therefore asked to conduct a rapid systematic review\nof the evidence to assess the association of microplastic exposures\non human health outcomes for policymakers in the State of California\n(details in Materials and Methods). The primary\nobjectives of this rapid systematic review were to evaluate the human\nand animal evidence assessing microplastic exposure to any adverse\nhuman health outcome,a rate the quality and\nstrength of the human and animal evidence, integrate the human and\nanimal evidence streams and develop a final bottom line statement\nregarding the health effects of microplastics."

      "text": "This work builds on a report\nby the California State Policy Evidence\nConsortium (CalSPEC), submitted to the State of California in 2023,16 which aimed to evaluate the impact of microplastic\nexposure on human health. CalSPEC seeks to provide rapid, well-researched\nresponses to policymakers in the State of California within a policy\ncycle, which is less than one year from the time the topic is provided\nto the report deadline. This prompted our research team to employ\nrapid systematic review methods rather than conduct a full systematic\nreview. Rapid reviews represent a type of systematic review\nthat omits\ncertain methodological steps to accelerate the process of performing\na full systematic review.38,39 This rapid review deviates\nfrom a full systematic review in three key ways. (1) After pilot screening,\none individual screened all studies, and the other individual screened\nonly excluded studies. (2) After title and abstract screening, a decision\nwas made to narrow the focus to select health outcomes (this is a\nresult of short-circuiting scoping during protocol development; however,\nwe did not look at the study results before prioritizing outcomes).\n(3) There was one risk of bias assessor and another that quality checked\ntheir decisions. This current publication expands our work on\nthe CalSPEC report\nto include an evaluation of respiratory outcomes and provides a more\ndetailed description of the methodology we used across the three body\nsystems evaluated. Our rapid review was guided by the Navigation\nGuide systematic\nreview method,40 which has been implemented\nto evaluate the health effects of multiple chemical exposures41−43 and used by the World Health Organization and International Labor\nOrganization Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease\nand Injury.44 We developed and made publicly\navailable a protocol that prespecified our methods for conducting\nthe rapid review on Open Science Framework (OSF).45 Due to the condensed time line set by CalSPEC, the review\nneeded to be conducted within a year. Therefore, we prioritized specific\nhealth outcomes for inclusion in the review. Deviations from the original\nprotocol (published on OSF October 17, 2022 OSF | The Human Health\nEffects of Microplastics) are summarized in the updated protocol (published\non OSF January 12, 2023) and below in Differences\nbetween the Protocol and Systematic Review. The objective, identified by the CalSPEC\nteam with guidance from the California State Legislature, was to answer\nthe initial research question, “What are the human health effects\nof microplastics exposure?” The “participants”,\n“exposure”, “comparator”, and “outcomes”\n(PECO) statements are outlined below. Humans and animals of any age and any health\nstatus. Any exposure to microplastics, based on our\npredefined definition of microplastics informed by the State of California,12 that occurred prior to or concurrent with diagnosis,\nexacerbation, or other measure of any health outcome. Exposures can\nbe from any route (air, water, or food), any duration, and any exposure\npathway (inhalation, ingestion, or direct contact) and can be measured\non the basis of biosamples or from exposure estimates. We defined\nmicroplastics as solid (“solid” means a substance or\nmixture that does not meet the definitions of a liquid or a gas) and\npolymeric materials [polymeric material means either (i) a particle\nof any composition with a continuous polymer surface coating of any\nthickness or (ii) a particle of any composition with a polymer content]\nto which chemical additives or other substances have been added, which\nare particles that are <5000 μm in one dimension. This definition\nis based on The State of California Water Board definition of microplastics\nin water12 with modification to include\nall microplastics without a percent content of polymers and lower\ndimension boundary requirement due to difficulty in measuring and\npotential exclusion of microplastics that come from surface coatings\nor tire wear (both of which will be included in our definition of\nMPs).15 Humans and animals exposed to lower levels\nof microplastics than the most exposed subjects or treatment groups. Any adverse health outcome was assessed. Adverse\nhealth outcomes were based on the definition from the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (“A biochemical change, functional impairment,\nor pathological lesion that affects the performance of the whole organism,\nor reduces an organism’s ability to respond to an additional\nenvironmental challenge”46) and\nCalifornia law hazard trait regulation (Title 22, Cal Code of Regs,\nDiv 4.5, Chapter 54; alternatively 22 CCR 69401 et seq) [“(a)\n“Adverse effect” for toxicological hazard traits and\nend points means a biochemical change, functional impairment, or pathologic\nlesion that negatively affects the performance of the whole organism,\nor reduces an organism’s ability to respond to an additional\nenvironmental challenge. An “adverse effect” for environmental\nhazard traits and end points means a change that negatively affects\nan ecosystem, community, assemblage, population, species, or individual\nlevel of biological organization.”47] Adverse health outcomes included systemic apical end points (e.g.,\nobservable end points such as cancer, birth defects, and organ level\neffects)48 and biological responses (e.g.,\ninfluences DNA/epigenome, oxidative stress, hormone responses, inflammation,\nimmunosuppression, and receptor mediation). Given the time line,\nwe prioritized digestive, reproductive and respiratory outcomes (see Table 1 for rationales).\nWe did not look at the study results before we made the decision to\nprioritize these outcomes. We performed a comprehensive\nsearch in partnership with a University of California, Davis, medical\nlibrarian. The search was first run on July 12, 2022, in PubMed, Embase,\nProQuest, and Web of Science and re-run on April 10–15, 2024,\nand was not restricted by year. The search strategies used in these\ndatabases are available in the protocol.45 Following the search, de-duplication of references was first conducted\nin EndNote49 and then in Excel before the\nreferences were uploaded to DistillerSR for screening, data extraction,\nand risk of bias evaluation.50 Title/abstract (T/A) and full text\nscreening was informed by our PECO statement and specific inclusion/exclusion\ncriteria. Four screeners (C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C.) reviewed references\nat T/A and then again at full text using DistillerSR.50 Following Cochrane’s Rapid Review guidance,38 C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C. independently screened\n30 of the same references at T/A to pilot the form and then continued\nto dual screen 20% of the references. Thereafter, C.B.C. and N.C.\nreviewed all of the remaining references at T/A for inclusion and\nG.B. and A.B. reviewed only references that C.B.C. and N.C. had tagged\nfor exclusion. A similar process was applied for the screening\nat full text using Cochrane’s Rapid Review guidance.38 C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C. pilot screened\nthe same five references at full text to test the form and calibrate\ntheir screening. After this, C.B.C. and N.C. screened all references\nat full text for inclusion and G.B. and A.B. verified only references\nthat C.B.C. and N.C. had tagged for exclusion. For both T/A\nand full text screening, any disagreements in terms\nof inclusion or exclusion of references were first reviewed and discussed\nbetween reviwers. If the reviewers could not reach a consensus, N.C.\nand T.J.W. served as arbitrators to make the final decision. As this was a rapid systematic\nreview, less restrictive eligibility criteria, which can be found\nin Differences between the Protocol and Systematic\nReview, was applied during the T/A screening. Ultimately, studies were included\nif they adhered to the PECO statement and met the following criteria.published in English or with an English version onlineprimary human observational studies, including,\ncohort,\ncase-control, cross-sectional, or other relevant designsexperimental animal studies such as mammalian rodent\nstudies (rats and mice)reported exposure\nto microplastics, as defined by the\nPECO statementcomparator group with\nno or lower levels of microplastic\nexposuremeasured any outcome of the\ndigestive system (excluding\ngut microbiota outcomes), reproductive system, or respiratory systemoutcomes reported quantitatively (p values and figures considered sufficient)mammalian rodents (rats and mice) exposed by oral route\nvia food and/or water (digestive and reproductive studies) or intratracheal\nor intranasal routes (respiratory studies)mammalian rodent (rats and mice) studies evaluated repeated\nexposures to microplasticsmammalian\nrodent (rats and mice) exposed to multiple\nconcentrations of microplastics (i.e., more than one exposed group) published in English or with an English version online primary human observational studies, including,\ncohort,\ncase-control, cross-sectional, or other relevant designs experimental animal studies such as mammalian rodent\nstudies (rats and mice) reported exposure\nto microplastics, as defined by the\nPECO statement comparator group with\nno or lower levels of microplastic\nexposure measured any outcome of the\ndigestive system (excluding\ngut microbiota outcomes), reproductive system, or respiratory system outcomes reported quantitatively (p values and figures considered sufficient) mammalian rodents (rats and mice) exposed by oral route\nvia food and/or water (digestive and reproductive studies) or intratracheal\nor intranasal routes (respiratory studies) mammalian rodent (rats and mice) studies evaluated repeated\nexposures to microplastics mammalian\nrodent (rats and mice) exposed to multiple\nconcentrations of microplastics (i.e., more than one exposed group) Studies were excluded if one\nor more of the following criteria were not met.does not contain original data (e.g., commentary, editorial,\nreview, etc.)in a language other than\nEnglishdoes not involve human or mammalian\nrodent (rats and\nmice) animals (i.e., cell line only, plants, non-rodent mammal studies,\nor rodents other than rats and mice)does not report exposure to microplastics, as defined\nby the PECO statementno comparator groupmammalian rodents (rats and mice) exposed\nto microplastics\nvia gavage, dermal exposures, intraperitoneal injection, caudal vein\ninjection, or intragastric administrationmammalian rodent (rats and mice) studies that evaluated\nonly one exposure group versus a controlcase report of a single participantother reasons (explanation required) does not contain original data (e.g., commentary, editorial,\nreview, etc.) in a language other than\nEnglish does not involve human or mammalian\nrodent (rats and\nmice) animals (i.e., cell line only, plants, non-rodent mammal studies,\nor rodents other than rats and mice) does not report exposure to microplastics, as defined\nby the PECO statement no comparator group mammalian rodents (rats and mice) exposed\nto microplastics\nvia gavage, dermal exposures, intraperitoneal injection, caudal vein\ninjection, or intragastric administration mammalian rodent (rats and mice) studies that evaluated\nonly one exposure group versus a control case report of a single participant other reasons (explanation required) We utilized DistillerSR for data extraction\nof study characteristics, including exposure and outcome information,\nand numerical results of the study (e.g., p values\nand dose response as reported in the studies).50 Our data extraction forms are available in the protocol\n(appendices C, D, and E).45 C.B.C., G.B.,\nand N.C. all participated in data extraction for reproductive and\ndigestive outcomes. C.B.C., G.B., N.C., A.B., and K.E.P. all extracted\ninformation about respiratory outcomes. A single reviewer extracted\nrelevant data from included studies, and a second reviewer checked\nthe extracted data for correctness and completeness.38 Any discrepancies were discussed, and N.C. and T.J.W. served\nas arbitrators in the event that a consensus could not be reached. We planned on extracting the mean and standard error from each\nstudy; however, as described in Analysis, the quantitative data were very limited due to poor reporting in\nstudies, and p values were often the only data available\nto extract. Additionally, the figures were extracted to provide Supporting Information to allow visual assessment\nof the dose response (control group compared to the largest dose of\nmicroplastics). We organized outcomes by\napical outcomes and biological changes. For the organization of biological\nchanges, we were guided by the concept of “key characteristics”.\nKey characteristics are biomarkers or mechanistic effects that comprise\nproperties of known human carcinogens or reproductive toxicants [these\ncharcteristics of carcinogens include (1) electrophilicity, (2) genotoxicity,\n(3) altering DNA repair or causeing genomic instability, (4) inducing\nepigenetic alterations, (5) inducing oxidative stress, (6) inducing\nchronic inflammation, (7) being immunosuppressive, (8) modulating\nreceptor-mediated effects, (9) causing immortalization, and (10) altering\ncell proliferation, cell death, or nutrient supply].51−57 For the digestive and respiratory outcomes, we utilized the key\ncharacteristics of carcinogens.53 For reproductive\nhealth outcomes, we utilized the key characteristics of reproductive\ntoxicity.51,56 We considered every eligible outcome\nin human studies. We prioritized the apical and biological outcomes\nlisted in Table 2 for\nanimal studies on the basis of what we considered to be the most relevant\nfor each system. We did not look at the study results before prioritizing\noutcomes. See Table 2 and Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nresults tables”) for all study results by system. We used the Navigation Guide\nrisk of bias tool to evaluate human and animal studies.41,43,58,59 In human studies, this contains nine domains: “study\ngroup representation”, “knowledge of group assignments”,\n“exposure assessment methods”, “outcome assessment\nmethods”, “confounding”, “incomplete outcome\ndata”, “selective outcome reporting”, “conflict\nof interest”, and “other”. In animal studies,\nthis tool contains seven domains that are evaluated for each study\nand/or outcome: “sequence generation”, “allocation\nconcealment”, “blinding of personnel and outcome assessors”,\n“incomplete outcome data”, “selective outcome\nreporting”, “conflict of interest”, and “other\npotential threats to validity”. We developed customized instructions\nfor evaluating the validity of how the outcome assessment was conducted\nfor the domain “other potential threats to validity”. Possible ratings for each domain were “low”, “probably\nlow”, “probably high”, or “high”\nrisk of bias, Prior to conducting risk of bias assessments, all individuals\n(C.B.C., K.E.P., G.B., N.C.) reviewed training materials from a systematic\nreview expert (J.L., listed in the acknowledgements) and our subject-matter\nexperts (G.B. and S.A.G.) discussed important criteria for considering\nthe “blinding of personnel and outcome assessors”, “incomplete\noutcome data”, and “other threats to validity”\n(how the assessment of outcomes was conducted). For more details on\nthe process of evaluating the risk of bias for each study, see the\nprotocol in ref (45). We used a single reviewer to evaluate the risk of bias (N.C.\nfor\ndigestive, respiratory, and reproductive outcomes and K.E.P. for respiratory\noutcomes) for each study by outcome, while a second reviewer (G.B.\nfor digestive and reproductive outcomes and S.A.G. and T.J.W. for\nrespiratory outcomes) verified the judgements.38 Any disagreements were first discussed between reviewers,\nwith T.J.W. serving as an arbitrator for any instances in which a\nconsensus could not be reached. The risk of bias was evaluated\non an outcome level, meaning that\ndifferent health outcomes in a study could receive different ratings\nwithin a single domain. We visually depicted and reported the ratings\nand rationales for each risk of bias domain across each study. We analyzed the result representing the effect\nof the highest level of microplastic exposure compared with the lowest\nlevel of microplastic exposure (i.e., highest concentration of microplastics\ncompared to the control group). We used the information extracted\non study characteristics to assess the comparability across studies\nand determine whether biological heterogeneity was a concern. We then\ncombined end points that were biologically similar across each system\nto synthesize results; e.g., for digestive outcomes and chronic inflammation,\nwe combined study results measuring TNF-α, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6,\nIL-9, IL-10, IP-10, IL-1α, Ifng, Il1b, G-CSF, RANTES, iNOS expression,\nCOX-2 expression, NF-kB, and mRNA expression. We planned on\nextracting the mean and standard error from each study and utilizing\na two-step analysis to conduct meta-analysis if the data were sufficiently\nhomogeneous. However, these data were not available in almost every\nstudy or too heterogeneous to combine. For example, papers reported\nonly point estimates, estimates were reported on different scales\nor used different association metrics, or the scales on the figures\nwere not fully reported preventing us from converting the results\nacross studies into a single scale. As this is a rapid review, we\ndid not contact study authors for missing data. We therefore\nused established methods of Cochrane for statistical\nsynthesis when meta-analysis of effect estimates was not possible.60 As we were unable to combine p values as there were only p values for studies\nwith statistical significance, we instead estimated the proportion\nof effects favoring the intervention along with a confidence interval\n(e.g., using the Wilson interval methods).61 Additionally, we assessed (1) the statistical significance\n(p value representing statistically significant differences\nbetween control and the most exposed group at follow-up) and (2) whether\na dose–response relationship was identified for each outcome\nincluded. For each synthesis that has concluded microplastics\nharm human\nhealth, we visually display the results included in the synthesis\nby adapting a Harvest plot to include the direction of effect, p value, and significance (e.g., <0.001, <0.01, ≤0.05,\nor >0.05), whether a dose response was identified, and the sample\nsize of the study. However, we were unable to conduct subgroup analysis\nor meta-regression to explore heterogeneity in the study results. We classified outcomes as showing harm from microplastic exposure\nif there was a change in effect in between the most exposed group\nand the non-exposed/least exposed group in the direction indicating\nharm (between group analysis). We acknowledge that our approach\nhas limitations; however, we have\navoided placing increased weight on statistical significance that\ndoes not address biological significance or the magnitude of the effect\nobserved.62 For outcomes for which we did\nnot conclude that microplastics harm human health, we narratively\npresent the results for each outcome. We conducted a sensitivity analysis\nto test the robustness of our results when including only one type\nof microplastic and only one study result per outcome to the synthesis,\nas per Cochrane guidance.63 For studies\nthat had multiple (more than two) eligible study results for an outcome\n(e.g., for the outcome “induction of chronic inflammation”,\na study measured and reported both IL-6 and TNFα), we randomly\nselected one result. We used two proportion Z tests\nto measure statistically significant differences between proportions\nof effects [i.e., one type of microplastic (e.g., polystyrene only)\nvs another type of microplastic (e.g., polyethylene only) and/or when\nonly one study result per outcome was included in the synthesis versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results for each study\nper outcome in the synthesis] at the 0.05 level (two-tailed). We assessed\nthe overall quality of the body of evidence for each health effect.\nEvidence from human studies was initially rated “moderate”,\nand for experimental animal studies, the quality of each body of evidence\nwas initially rated “high” on the basis of a previously\ndescribed rationale (see Figure 1).43,64 As animals can be randomized\nbefore being exposed to toxic hazards like microplastics, this eliminates\nselection bias and the potential influence of confounding, and they\nare therefore started at a higher level of certainty. The rating of\nthe quality of each body of evidence was then adjusted on the basis\nof eight factors and could ultimately be rated as “high”,\n“moderate”, “low”, or “very low”.\nThe quality of each body of evidence could be downgraded by five factors:\n“risk of bias across studies”, “indirectness”,\n“inconsistency”, “imprecision”, and “publication\nbias”. The quality of each body of evidence could be upgraded\nby three factors: “large magnitude of effect”, “dose\nresponse”, and “accounting for confounding that might\nminimize the effect” (Figure 1). The possible ratings for each downgrade or upgrade\nfactor were 0 (no change from the initial quality rating), −1\n(one-level downgrade), −2 (two-level downgrade), +1 (one-level\nupgrade), or +2 (two-level upgrade). Review authors (C.B.C., N.C.,\nG.B., K.E.P., T.J.W., and S.A.G.) independently evaluated the quality\nof the evidence across studies, and then ratings were compared as\na group. We recorded (and present) the consensus and rationale for\neach factor and each final decision. Evaluating the quality and strength of\nthe body of evidence using\nNavigation Guide. We rated the overall strength\nof the body of evidence (Figure 1) on the basis of four considerations: (1) “quality\nof the body of evidence”, (2) “direction of effect estimates”,\n(3) “confidence in the effect” (considering factors\nsuch as the number and size of studies), and (4) “any other\ncompelling attributes of the data that may influence certainty”.\nThis informed the final hazard conclusion statements, which were guided\nby the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and\nTranslation (NTP OHAT) approach.64 There\nwere four possible conclusions regarding the risk of microplastic\nexposure to humans outlined in Figure 2: (1) “known” to be a hazard to humans,\n(2) “presumed” to be a hazard to humans, (3) “suspected”\nto be a hazard to humans, and (4) “not classifiable”\nas a hazard to humans. Hazard identification conclusion statements informed by\nthe NTP\nOHAT approach."

We used the information extracted\non study characteristics to assess the comparability across studies\nand determine whether biological heterogeneity was a concern. We then\ncombined end points that were biologically similar across each system\nto synthesize results; e.g., for digestive outcomes and chronic inflammation,\nwe combined study results measuring TNF-α, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6,\nIL-9, IL-10, IP-10, IL-1α, Ifng, Il1b, G-CSF, RANTES, iNOS expression,\nCOX-2 expression, NF-kB, and mRNA expression. We planned on\nextracting the mean and standard error from each study and utilizing\na two-step analysis to conduct meta-analysis if the data were sufficiently\nhomogeneous. However, these data were not available in almost every\nstudy or too heterogeneous to combine. For example, papers reported\nonly point estimates, estimates were reported on different scales\nor used different association metrics, or the scales on the figures\nwere not fully reported preventing us from converting the results\nacross studies into a single scale. As this is a rapid review, we\ndid not contact study authors for missing data. We therefore\nused established methods of Cochrane for statistical\nsynthesis when meta-analysis of effect estimates was not possible.60 As we were unable to combine p values as there were only p values for studies\nwith statistical significance, we instead estimated the proportion\nof effects favoring the intervention along with a confidence interval\n(e.g., using the Wilson interval methods).61 Additionally, we assessed (1) the statistical significance\n(p value representing statistically significant differences\nbetween control and the most exposed group at follow-up) and (2) whether\na dose–response relationship was identified for each outcome\nincluded. For each synthesis that has concluded microplastics\nharm human\nhealth, we visually display the results included in the synthesis\nby adapting a Harvest plot to include the direction of effect, p value, and significance (e.g., <0.001, <0.01, ≤0.05,\nor >0.05), whether a dose response was identified, and the sample\nsize of the study. However, we were unable to conduct subgroup analysis\nor meta-regression to explore heterogeneity in the study results. We classified outcomes as showing harm from microplastic exposure\nif there was a change in effect in between the most exposed group\nand the non-exposed/least exposed group in the direction indicating\nharm (between group analysis). We acknowledge that our approach\nhas limitations; however, we have\navoided placing increased weight on statistical significance that\ndoes not address biological significance or the magnitude of the effect\nobserved.62 For outcomes for which we did\nnot conclude that microplastics harm human health, we narratively\npresent the results for each outcome."

      "text": "The initial search identified 1815 unique studies\nfor screening\nfrom which 17 animal studies met our inclusion criteria for data extraction\n(see Supporting Information File 1, “Study\nFlow Diagram”). The second search identified an additional\n1042 studies, with 14 included (three human and 11 animal). See Supporting Information File 2 (“List of\nexcluded studies and reasons for exclusion at full text review”). Three human cross-sectional\nobservational studies examined reproductive (n =\n2) and respiratory (n = 1) outcomes, and 28 experimental\nanimal studies examined reproductive (n = 11), respiratory\n(n = 7), and digestive (n = 10)\noutcomes. Human studies were published from 2022 to 2024.\nTotal study populations ranged from 40 to 80. Human studies were conducted\nin Turkey (n = 1), Iran (n = 1),\nand China (n = 1). Microplastics were measured in\nmaternal amniotic fluid (n = 1), placenta (n = 1), and nasal lavage fluid (n = 1).\nMicroplastics were characterized by polymer type in two (66%) of the\nstudies. Polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethyleneterephthalate, polypropylene,\nchlorinated polyethylene, polyamide, and others were detected. Animal studies were published from 2018 to 2024\nand were mostly conducted in China [n = 22(79%)].\nMost of the animal studies [n = 22(79%)] were conducted\nin mice with 15–180 rodents per study. The total number of\nrodents per exposure group ranged from five to 45. The number of exposure\ngroups ranged from two to four per study. See Supporting Information File 3 (“List of included studies\nand study characteristics”). In animals, microplastics\nwere administered through ingestion in water [n =\n16 (57%)], in food [n = 5 (18%)], or via inhalation\n[n = 7(25%)]. Microplastics in inhalation studies\nwere suspended in air, water, or saline with various methods of delivery,\nincluding, for example, intranasal inhalation and intratracheal instillation.\nExposures lasted from 14 days to 32 weeks. Nearly all exposures were\nin adult aged animals, with mice in two reproductive studies being\nexposed during early life development (i.e., during gestation or during\ngestation and postnatal development). There was little variability\nin study design and the types, sizes, and shapes of the microplastics\nacross the 28 animal studies. The type of microplastic used was overwhelmingly\npolystyrene [n = 22(79%)]. The size of microplastics\nadministered was between 0.1 and 467.85 μm. Animal studies\ncovering digestive and respiratory outcomes were\nconducted in China, France, and the Republic of Korea, and reproductive\noutcome studies were conducted in China, Pakistan, and Canada. Some\npublications were produced by the same lab group, raising the possibility\nthat errors in the method or approach might be propagated across multiple\nstudies. Two lab groups produced two digestive papers each,68−71 while another published three reproductive papers.72−74 See Tables 3–6 for included\nhuman and animal studies with further details in Supporting Information Files 3 and 4. The outcomes column does not contain\nall of the outcomes in the study, only the outcomes prioritized for\ndata extraction. See Supporting Information\nFile 5 (“Risk of bias heat map for summaries of risk\nof bias judgments”) for the studies included in our systematic\nreview of microplastic exposure. Risk of bias heat maps are provided\nfor each outcome (digestive, reproductive, and respiratory) for each\nevidence stream (human and animal). Risk of bias designations for\nindividual studies are assigned according to criteria provided in\nthe protocol,45 and the justification for\neach study is provided in Supporting Information\nFile 6 (“Risk of bias ratings and justification”). There were no human studies examining\nthis outcome. We evaluated six outcomes across 10 studies relating\nto the small or large intestines of the digestive tract, focusing\non apical end points (in this case, gross or microanatomic colonic\nand small intestinal effects) and biological outcomes grouped into\nthe following key characteristics of carcinogens: oxidative stress,\nchronic inflammation, immunosuppression, receptor-mediated effects\n(hormones), and cell proliferation (e.g., goblet cell count). Similar measurements were conducted between studies; however, not\nall measurements were the same, and estimates could not be combined\nin a meta-analysis or visually displayed collectively in a figure\nbecause estimates were reported on different scales, used different\nassociation metrics, or were not fully reported. Six studies\nevaluated apical measurements on the digestive tract, including colon\nlength, villus length, and other histopathological measurements of\nthe colon and small intestine69−71,75−77 (see Supporting Information File\n4, “Study Results”). For the risk of bias,\none study was high or probably high for five domains,69 one study was high or probably high for two and three domains\n(different apical outcomes with different ROB ratings),76 three studies were high or probably high for\ntwo domains,70,71,75 and one study was high or probably high for one domain77 (see Supporting Information\nFiles 5, “Risk of bias heat map”, and 6 for justification of ratings). For microplastic\ntype, five studies tested polystyrene69−71,76,77 and one tested polyethylene microplastics.75 One study76 observed significant alterations\nto the colon, including changes in the muscular layer width. The same\nstudy also found significant colon shortening in the exposed group.\nAnother study75 observed significant differences\nin crypt depth but not the villus length in the proximal and distal\nsmall intestines for the most exposed group (which throughout this\nsection will often be termed the “exposed group”). The\nsame study also observed a significant increase in the mucosal surface\narea in the colon epithelium but found opposite or no significant\nchange in staining with neutral and acid mucins in different parts\nof the digestive system. The third study69 found a significant decrease in multiple histopathological end points.\nThe fourth study71 found a significant\ndecrease in the extent of mucus secretion in colon for the exposed\ngroup. The fifth found a significant decrease in the thickness of\nthe mucosa layer of the small intestine.77 The final study found a significant decrease of the alcian blue-periodic\nacid Schiff (AB/PAS) solution positive area (area with mucins) in\nall microplastic exposure groups compared to control (unexposed) but\ndid not exhibit a dose response effect across the groups.70 The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful equals 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.85–1.00]\n[n = 22 (positive study results)/22 (total study\nresults)] [see Figure 3 for (1) the direction of the effect, (2) p values,\n(3) the dose response, and (4) the study sample size for included\nstudies in this synthesis]. Apical outcomes (colon and small intestine). We conducted a sensitivity analysis and (1) compared\nthe estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n =\n12/12) versus polyethylene microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.72–1.00)\n(n = 10/10) and (2) compared the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful when only one result per study was\nconsidered = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.61–1.00) (n = 6/6) versus our primary analysis of including all study results\nfrom each study = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.85–1.00) (n = 22/22). See Supporting Information File 7 (“Sensitivity analysis”). We found no difference\nin the proportions of effects between polystyrene\nmicroplastics and polyethylene microplastics, and we found no difference\nin the proportions of the effect between our analysis of only one\nresult per study being considered versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study. We concluded that exposure\nto microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact the colon and small intestine in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n[see Supporting Information File 8 (“Evidence\nratings for studies”) for a detailed rationale for these ratings],\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association, considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Two studies assessed cell proliferation and death.69,76 For the risk of bias, one study was high or probably high\nfor five domains69 and one high or probably\nhigh for three domains76 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, both studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics.\nThe first study showed a significant decrease in the number in crypts\nof Lieberkuhn (intestinal mucosal glands) and goblet cells (cells\nthat secrete mucin) in the exposed group.69 The second study also found a significant decrease in the number\nof goblet cells.76 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n = 3/3). See Supporting Information File 9 (“Graphical display of results”) and Figure S1. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as every\nresult was in the direction of showing harm. We concluded that\nexposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal cell proliferation and cell death in\nhumans on the basis of (a) the “moderate” quality of\nthe body of evidence (see Supporting Information\nFile 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”), (b)\nthe direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Five studies evaluated\nbiomarkers (e.g., inflammatory cytokines) related to chronic inflammation.68,75,76,78,79 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,78 two studies were rated high or probably high\nfor two domains,75,76 and one study was rated high\nor probably high for only one domain79 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics68,76,79 and two studies tested polyethylene\nmicroplastics.75,78 Cytokines such as tumor\nnecrosis factor-α (TNF-α),\nIL-2, IL-6, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IP-10, G-CSF, iLb, Rantes, and IL-1α\nwere measured in multiple studies. TNF-α levels significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and the intestine.68 In two studies, TNF-α levels were not\nsignificantly different regardless of the exposed group in colon and\nsmall intestine.75,79 The level of IL-6 also significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and all75,79 or part68 of the small intestine. The\nlevel of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) significantly decreased\nin the colon76 but not in intestinal serum.78 There was no significant change in Ilb in the\nintestine in one study.79 IL-1α levels\nsignificantly increased in the intestine in two studies.68,78 For one study, there are two proteins related to inflammation (iNOS\nand COX-2) with levels that were significantly increased in the exposure\ngroup compared to the control.68 Eight\nother cytokines were measured in specific studies, and most of them\nhad significant changes (increase or decrease, depending on the specific\ncytokine) between control and exposure groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32). See Supporting Information File 9\nand Figure S2. We conducted a sensitivity analysis and\n(1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n =\n12/12) versus polyethylene microplastics = 0.90 (95% CI of 0.70–97)\n(n = 18/20) (difference between proportions p = 0.26) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.51–1.00) (n = 4/4) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.61) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polyethylene results or when only one result per\nstudy was considered versus our primary analysis of including all\nstudy results from each study. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal chronic inflammation in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Two studies75,79 measured biomarkers related to the immune system, reporting significant\nchanges in immunophenotype populations (CD4 T lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes,\nCD3+CD8+ T cells, CD19+ lymphocytes and dendritic cells, and inflammatory\nmonocytes), neutrophils (granulocytes in white blood cells), and anti-inflammatory\nmacrophages (play a critical role in inflammation). Changes in cell\npopulations may not directly relate to immunosuppression, but they\ndo relate to the immune system and could produce an immunomodulatory\neffect. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9). See Supporting Information\nFile 9 and Figure S3. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\non the basis of microplastic type or inclusion of only one result\nper study as every result was in the direction of showing harm. For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably high\nfor two domains75 and one study was rated\nhigh or probably high79 for only one domain\n(see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study\ntested polystyrene microplastics79 and\none study polyethylene microplastics.75 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal immune system function in humans on\nthe basis of (a) the “high” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Four studies examined\nmarkers indicating increased levels of oxidative stress in the colon\nand intestine.68,76,79,80 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,76 and two studies were rated high or probably\nhigh for only one domain79,80 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies tested polystyrene68,76,79 and one study polyethylene.80 Two studies76,80 found significant\nchanges for\nglutathione in the colon and intestine, three studies malondialdehyde\nconcentrations in the colon and intestine,76,79,80 and two an increase in reactive oxidative\nspecies in the intestine.68,79 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n = 12/12). We concluded that impacts of microplastic exposure\non intestinal\noxidative stress are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. One study measured hormonal changes (specifically, cholecystokinin,\nor CCK, and gastrin) in the midcolon.69 Midcolonic concentrations of CCK, which is a peptide hormone responsible\nfor the digestion of fat and protein, and gastrin, a hormone that\nstimulates gastric juice secretion, were significantly decreased.\nSee Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). For the risk of bias, this study was rated\nhigh or probably high for four domains69 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study\ntested polystyrene microplastics.69 The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00) (n = 2/2). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure\non digestive\nhormones are “not classifiable” on the basis of (a)\nthe “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality of the evidence for digestive\noutcomes as “moderate”. See Supporting\nInformation File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor the detailed rationale for these ratings. Across the outcomes,\nwe identified that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto be a digestive hazard to humans, including a suspected link to\ncolon cancer, using the key characteristics of carcinogens approach.53,81 We evaluated two outcomes across two\nstudies related to the reproductive system.35,36 Both studies evaluated the growth outcome\nbirth weight, one finding a statistically significant correlation\nwith microplastic load in the placenta and reduced birth weight35 and the other no difference with microplastic\nload in amniotic fluid.36 One study found\na statistically significant correlation with microplastic load in\nthe placenta and reduced birth length and head circumference.35 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.75\n(95% CI of 0.30–0.95) (n = 3/4). For\nthe risk of bias, one study was rated high risk of bias for\nthe domain of confounding and rated probably high risk of bias for\nknowledge of group assignments (blinding),35 and one study was rated probably high risk of bias for selection\nof study groups and knowledge of group assignments36 [see Supporting Information File 5 (“Risk of bias heat map”) and Supporting Information File 6 for justification of ratings]. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor birth outcomes in humans on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting\nInformation File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”,\nfor a detailed rationale for these ratings), (b) the direction of\nthe effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse health effect\nwith an increasing level of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence\nin the association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study measured the associations\nbetween total microplastic abundance in maternal amniotic fluid and\ngestational age, finding a statistically significant decrease in age\nfor a unit (particles per gram) increase in microplastics.36 See Supporting Information\nFile 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful = 1.00\n(95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1). For\nthe risk of bias, this study was rated probably high risk of\nbias for the domains selection of study groups and knowledge of group\nassignments36 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not\nclassifiable”\nfor gestational age development in humans on the basis of (a) the\n“low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. We evaluated 10 outcomes across 11 studies\nrelated to the reproductive system. Four studies72,73,82,83 evaluated\nfemale end points (including hormone level changes in the serum and\novaries and impacts to ovarian follicles), and five studies74,84−87 evaluated male end points (including sperm damage, testicular damage,\nand serum hormone level changes). One study evaluated oocyte meiotic\nprogression/blatstocyst development.82 Four\nevaluated separate birth outcomes (weight of fetus and placenta, litter\nsize, anogenital index, and distance).82,86−88 One study evaluated age at puberty.87 Studies that assessed hormone levels in the serum and ovaries were\nalso included, as hormonal changes are a key characteristic of reproductive\ntoxicants that may also impact reproductive health directly.51,56,81 Similar measurements were\nconducted between studies; however, not all measurements were the\nsame, and estimates could not be combined in a meta-analysis or visually\ndisplayed collectively in a figure because estimates were reported\non different scales, used different association metrics, or were not\nfully reported. One study88 evaluated birth outcomes by measuring the weight of the\nfetus and placenta. They found a statistically significant decrease\nin the weight of the fetus between the most and least exposed groups,\nbut not for the weight of the placenta. See Supporting\nInformation File 4 (“Study Results”). The\nestimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful\n= 0.50 (95% CI of 0.09–0.91) (n = 1/2). For the risk of bias, this study was rated probably high for two\ndomains (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type,\nthis study tested polystyrene. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor birth outcomes of the weight of the fetus and placenta on the\nbasis of (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. Two studies82,86 evaluated\nthe birth outcome of litter size. One study found a statistically\nsignificant difference in the number of offspring between the most\nand least exposed groups.82 One study found\nno difference in litter size or post-survival rate.86 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.33 (95% CI of 0.06–0.79)\n(n = 1/3). For the risk of bias, both studies\nwere rated high or probably\nhigh for three domains82,86 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study tested polystyrene87 and polyethylene.82 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not\nclassifiable”\nfor the birth outcome of litter size on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for\nstudies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited\nconfidence in the association considering factors including the number\nand size of studies. One study87 evaluated age at puberty and found a statistically significant decrease\nin onset between the most and least exposed groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00)\n(n = 1/1). For the risk of bias, this study\nwas rated probably high for one\ndomain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polystyrene.87 We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “not classifiable”\nfor the onset of puberty on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study82 evaluated oocyte meiotic progression/blatstocyst\ndevelopment and found a statistically significant percentage decrease\nin both outcomes between the least and most exposed groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00)\n(n = 2/2). For the risk of bias, this study\nwas rated high or probably high\nfor three domains82 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polyethylene.82 We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “not classifiable”\nfor effect meiotic progression/blatstocyst development on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. One study89 measured testicular aging across seven measures and saw a consistent\nstatistically significant effect in each one. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.65–1.00) (n = 7/7). For the risk of bias, this study was rated high or\nprobably high\nfor three domains (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, this study tested polystyrene microplastics. We concluded\nthat exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor testicular aging on the basis of (a) the “very low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study87 measured anogenital index and distance in two\nsets of pups, postnatal day 35 and 70, and found no significant difference\nbetween the least and most exposed groups for either end point or\npostnatal day. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.50 (95%\nCI of 0.15–0.85) (n = 2/4). For the\nrisk of bias, this study was rated probably high for one\ndomain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polystyrene. We\nconcluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor anogenital index and distance on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for\nstudies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited\nconfidence in the association considering factors including the number\nand size of studies. Five studies evaluated the effects of\nmicroplastic exposure on sperm and sperm-related outcomes.74,84−87 For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably\nhigh for four and three domains (different apical outcomes and/or\nresults with different ROB ratings),85 one\nstudy was rated high or probably high for three domains,86 one study was rated high or probably high for\nthree and two domains (different apical outcomes and/or results with\ndifferent ROB ratings),74 one study was\nrated high or probably high for two domains and one domain (different\napical outcomes and/or results with different ROB ratings),84 and one study was rated probably high for only\none domain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, all five studies tested polystyrene.74,84−87 Studies found trends in declines in living sperm, sperm concentrations,\nand sperm motility as well as increases in sperm malformation (also\nreported as sperm deformity or sperm abnormality). Outcome assessors\nwere blinded during sperm malformations and viability assessments\nin only one study.84 All studies reported\npositive associations between increasing microplastic exposure and\ndecreases in measures of sperm quality and/or quantity. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00) (n = 9/9). See Supporting Information File 8 and Figure S4. We did not conduct a sensitivity\nanalysis as all studies were in the direction of showing harm. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact sperm quality and testicular health in humans\non the basis of (a) the “high” quality of the body of\nevidence (Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”), (b) the direction\nof the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse health effect\nwith an increasing level of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence\nin the association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. See Supporting Information File 7 (“Evidence ratings for studies”) for a detailed rationale\nfor these ratings. One study84 evaluated the effects of microplastic exposure on germinal\ncell thickness and found a significant decrease and dose–response\neffects between control and exposure groups.84 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00)\n(n = 1/1). This study was rated high or probably\nhigh for two domains. This study tested polystyrene. We\nconcluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor germinal thickness on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. Two studies evaluated\nthe effects of microplastic exposure on ovarian follicles.72,73 For the risk of bias, both studies were rated high or probably\nhigh for three domains72,73 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, both studies tested polystyrene.72,73 Both studies found a significant decrease in the number of\ngrowing\nfollicles for the most exposed group and a consistent dose–response\nrelationship. For both studies, five random visual fields were used\nto assess the number of growing follicles via microscope imaging for\neach rat model (six from each group). It is unclear whether five images\nwere sufficient to qualitatively assess the measurement, but the authors\ndo refer to previous literature for their methodology. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00) (n = 2/2). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S5. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as both\nstudies tested polystyrene and each study contributed only one study\nresult for the outcome. We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “suspected”\nto adversely impact ovarian follicle development in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence,\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Six studies measured alterations\nof reproductive hormones.72,73,82−84,87 For the risk\nof bias, two studies were rated high or probably high for four domains,82,83 two studies were rated high or probably high for two domains,72,73 and two studies were rated high or probably high for one domain84,87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, five studies\ntested polystyrene72,73,83,84,87 and one study\ntested polyethylene.82 Two studies\nfound significant changes in anti-Müllerian\nhormone (AMH) concentration: one in serum73 and the other in ovaries.72 One study\nfound significant changes in Inhibin in pups postnatal day 35 and\n70.87 Four studies measured luteinizing\nhormone (LH),82−84,87 but only one found\nsignificant decreases in the level of serum LH.84 Two studies found no significant changes in progesterone.82,83 Three of four studies found significant changes in follicle-stimulating\nhormone (FSH).83,84,87 Three studies found significant changes in testosterone concentrations.83,84,87 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.77 (95% CI of 0.57–0.90) (n = 17/22). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S6. We conducted a sensitivity analysis and\n(1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.78 (95% CI of 0.55–0.91) (n =\n14/18) versus polyethylene microplastics = 0.75 (95% CI of 0.30–95)\n(n = 3/4) (difference between proportions p = 0.90) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 0.83 (95% CI of 0.44–0.97) (n = 5/6) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.77 (95% CI of 0.57–0.90) (n = 17/22) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.75) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and polyethylene results or when only one result per study\nwas considered versus our primary analysis of including all study\nresults from each study. We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “suspected”\nto adversely impact reproductive hormones in humans on the basis of\n(a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence,\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality\nof the evidence for these outcomes\nas “moderate”. See Supporting Information File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”) for a\ndetailed rationale for these ratings. Across the\noutcomes that were fully evaluated, we identified that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected” to be a hazard to the human\nreproductive system. We evaluated one study91 that measured the relationship between chronic rhinosinusitis\nwithout nasal polyps and microplastics and found a statistically significant\ndifference in the level of microplastics in patients with chronic\nrhinosinusitis without nasal polyps compared to healthy volunteers. The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1). For the risk of bias, this study was rated high for\nconfounding\nand probably high for study group selection and exposure assessment\n(see Supporting Information File 5, “Risk\nof bias heat map”, and Supporting Information File 6 for justification of ratings). We concluded that\nexposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor chronic rhinosinusitis in humans on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence, (b) the direction of\nthe effect, and (c) the limited confidence in the association considering\nfactors including the number and size of studies. We evaluated five outcomes across seven\nstudies related to the respiratory system. Four studies92−95 evaluated total cell count (total cells, macrophages, lymphocytes,\nneutrophils, and polymorphonuclear cells). Three studies measured92,93,95 pulmonary function (pressure–volume\nloops, peak expiratory flows, tissue dampening, tissue elastance,\ncentral airway resistance, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory\nvolume, tidal volume, minute volume, inspiratory time, expiratory\ntime, peak inspiratory flow, and peak expiratory flow). Four studies93−96 evaluated lung injury (lung tissue score, pulmonary parenchymal\narea, average vessel thickness, and number of alveolar septa). Three studies evaluated biomarkers related to chronic inflammation\n(IL-6 secretions, TNF-α secretions, IL-8 secretions, IL-1β\nsecretions, TGF-β). Three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers for lung fibrosis (vimentin,\nα-SMA, surfactant protein-C, MCP-1, and Krebs von den lungen-6\n& KC) resulting from inflammation, and three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers related\nto oxidative stress (ROS, SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT). Similar measurements\nwere conducted between studies; however, not\nall measurements were the same, and estimates could not be combined\nin a meta-analysis or visually displayed collectively in a figure\nbecause estimates were reported on different scales, used different\nassociation metrics, or were not fully reported. Three studies92,93,95 evaluated pulmonary function (pressure–volume\nloops, peak expiratory flows, tissue dampening, tissue elastance,\ncentral airway resistance, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory\nvolume, tidal volume, minute volume, inspiratory time, expiratory\ntime, peak inspiratory flow, and peak expiratory flow) and found decreased\nforced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1). See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.83 (95% CI of 0.63–0.93)\n(n = 19/23). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S7. For the risk of bias, three studies\nwere rated high/probably high\nfor two domains92,9395 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, two studies\ntested polystyrene92,93,95 and one tested tire wear microplastic\nparticles.93 We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.73 (95% CI of 0.48–0.89) (n =\n11/15) versus tire wear microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.68–1.00)\n(n = 8/8) (difference between proportions p = 0.11) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n = 3/3) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.83 (95% CI of 0.63–0.93) (n = 19/23) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.43) (Supporting Information File 7). We found polystyrene\nmicroplastics had a lower estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing harm versus tire wear microplastics;\nhowever, the difference was not statistically significant. We found\nwhen only one result per study was considered, the estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful was greater\nversus our primary analysis of including all study results from each\nstudy; however, the difference was not statistically significant. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact pulmonary function in humans on the basis of (a)\nthe “moderate” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”, for a detailed rationale for these ratings),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Four studies93−96 evaluated lung injury (lung tissue\nscore, pulmonary parenchymal area, average vessel thickness, number\nof alveolar septa, and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia) and found\nconsistent effects indicating damage and fibrosis to the lung tissue.\nThese findings are consistent with lung tissue damage. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 0.88 (95% CI of 0.53–0.98)\n(n = 7/8). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S8. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 for three domains,93 and two were rated high/probably high for two\ndomains95,96 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, two studies tested polystyrene,95,96 one tested\npolypropylene,94 and one tested\ntire wear microplastic particles93 We conducted a sensitivity analysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n =\n3/3) versus polypropylene = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1) and versus tire wear microplastics = 1.00 (95%\nCI of 0.51–1.00) (n = 4/4) and (2) measured\nthe proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful when only\none result per study was considered = 0.75 (95% CI of 0.30–0.95)\n(n = 3/4) versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study = 0.88 (95% CI of 0.53–0.98)\n(n = 7/8) (difference between proportions p = 0.57) (Supporting Information File 7). We found no difference in the estimate of the proportion\nof effects\nshowing harm between polystyrene versus polyethylene microplastics\nand between polystyrene versus tire ware microplastics. We found when\nonly one result per study was considered, the estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful was lower versus our\nprimary analysis of including all study results from each study; however,\nthe difference was not statistically significant. We concluded\nthat exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto cause lung injury on the basis of (a) the “moderate”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Four studies92−95 evaluated total cell counts (total\ncells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and polymorphonuclear\ncells). For the risk of bias, one study was rated high/probably\nhigh across four domains,94 one was rated\nhigh/probably high for two domains,95 two\nwere rated high/probably high for one domain92 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, two studies tested polystyrene,92,95 one tested polypropylene,94 and one tested\ntire wear microplastic particles.93 Two\nstudies found a decrease in the number of macrophages that were statistically\nsignificant.93,95 Three studies found an increase\nin the total number of cells and lymphocytes.93−95 Two studies\nfound a statistically significant increase in the number of neutrophils.94,95 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.74 (95% CI of 0.54–0.87) (n = 17/23). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure on\ntotal cell counts are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “very low” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Five studies92,94,95,98,99 evaluated biomarkers related to chronic inflammation\n(IL-6 secretions, TNF-α secretions, IL-8 secretions, IL-1β\nsecretions and TGF-β) and resultant lung fibrosis (vimentin,\nα-SMA, surfactant protein-C, Krebs von den lungen-6, and MCP-1)\nand found increased levels of measured biomarkers in mice exposed\nto microplastics consistent with inflammation and lung fibrosis. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 0.96 (95% CI of 0.82–0.99)\n(n = 27/28). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S9. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 one study was rated high/probably\nhigh in three domains,97 and three studies\nwere rated high/probably high for two domains92,95,98 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, four studies tested polystyrene92,95,98,97 and one tested polypropylene94 microplastics. We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.96 (95% CI of 0.79–0.99) (n =\n22/23) versus polypropylene microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.57–1.00)\n(n = 5/5) (difference between proportions p = 0.64) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.57–1.00) (n = 5/5) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.96 (95% CI of 0.82–0.99) (n = 27/28) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.64) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polypropylene results or when only one result\nper study was considered versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study. We concluded that exposure\nto microplastics is “suspected”\nto induce chronic inflammation and lung fibrosis in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers related to oxidative\nstress (ROS, SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT) and found that the decrease in\nthe levels of SOD, GSH/PX, and CAT and the increase in the level of\nROS are consistent with oxidative stress in the lung. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9).

Human studies were published from 2022 to 2024.\nTotal study populations ranged from 40 to 80. Human studies were conducted\nin Turkey (n = 1), Iran (n = 1),\nand China (n = 1). Microplastics were measured in\nmaternal amniotic fluid (n = 1), placenta (n = 1), and nasal lavage fluid (n = 1).\nMicroplastics were characterized by polymer type in two (66%) of the\nstudies. Polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethyleneterephthalate, polypropylene,\nchlorinated polyethylene, polyamide, and others were detected. Animal studies were published from 2018 to 2024\nand were mostly conducted in China [n = 22(79%)].\nMost of the animal studies [n = 22(79%)] were conducted\nin mice with 15–180 rodents per study. The total number of\nrodents per exposure group ranged from five to 45. The number of exposure\ngroups ranged from two to four per study.

In animals, microplastics\nwere administered through ingestion in water [n =\n16 (57%)], in food [n = 5 (18%)], or via inhalation\n[n = 7(25%)]. Microplastics in inhalation studies\nwere suspended in air, water, or saline with various methods of delivery,\nincluding, for example, intranasal inhalation and intratracheal instillation.\nExposures lasted from 14 days to 32 weeks. Nearly all exposures were\nin adult aged animals, with mice in two reproductive studies being\nexposed during early life development (i.e., during gestation or during\ngestation and postnatal development). There was little variability\nin study design and the types, sizes, and shapes of the microplastics\nacross the 28 animal studies. The type of microplastic used was overwhelmingly\npolystyrene [n = 22(79%)]. The size of microplastics\nadministered was between 0.1 and 467.85 μm. Animal studies\ncovering digestive and respiratory outcomes were\nconducted in China, France, and the Republic of Korea, and reproductive\noutcome studies were conducted in China, Pakistan, and Canada. Some\npublications were produced by the same lab group, raising the possibility\nthat errors in the method or approach might be propagated across multiple\nstudies. Two lab groups produced two digestive papers each,68−71 while another published three reproductive papers.72−74 See Tables 3–6 for included\nhuman and animal studies with further details in Supporting Information Files 3 and 4.

Animal studies\ncovering digestive and respiratory outcomes were\nconducted in China, France, and the Republic of Korea, and reproductive\noutcome studies were conducted in China, Pakistan, and Canada. Some\npublications were produced by the same lab group, raising the possibility\nthat errors in the method or approach might be propagated across multiple\nstudies. Two lab groups produced two digestive papers each,68−71 while another published three reproductive papers.72−74 See Tables 3–6 for included\nhuman and animal studies with further details in Supporting Information Files 3 and 4.

We evaluated six outcomes across 10 studies relating\nto the small or large intestines of the digestive tract, focusing\non apical end points (in this case, gross or microanatomic colonic\nand small intestinal effects) and biological outcomes grouped into\nthe following key characteristics of carcinogens: oxidative stress,\nchronic inflammation, immunosuppression, receptor-mediated effects\n(hormones), and cell proliferation (e.g., goblet cell count). Similar measurements were conducted between studies; however, not\nall measurements were the same, and estimates could not be combined\nin a meta-analysis or visually displayed collectively in a figure\nbecause estimates were reported on different scales, used different\nassociation metrics, or were not fully reported. Six studies\nevaluated apical measurements on the digestive tract, including colon\nlength, villus length, and other histopathological measurements of\nthe colon and small intestine69−71,75−77 (see Supporting Information File\n4, “Study Results”). For the risk of bias,\none study was high or probably high for five domains,69 one study was high or probably high for two and three domains\n(different apical outcomes with different ROB ratings),76 three studies were high or probably high for\ntwo domains,70,71,75 and one study was high or probably high for one domain77 (see Supporting Information\nFiles 5, “Risk of bias heat map”, and 6 for justification of ratings). For microplastic\ntype, five studies tested polystyrene69−71,76,77 and one tested polyethylene microplastics.75 One study76 observed significant alterations\nto the colon, including changes in the muscular layer width. The same\nstudy also found significant colon shortening in the exposed group.\nAnother study75 observed significant differences\nin crypt depth but not the villus length in the proximal and distal\nsmall intestines for the most exposed group (which throughout this\nsection will often be termed the “exposed group”). The\nsame study also observed a significant increase in the mucosal surface\narea in the colon epithelium but found opposite or no significant\nchange in staining with neutral and acid mucins in different parts\nof the digestive system. The third study69 found a significant decrease in multiple histopathological end points.\nThe fourth study71 found a significant\ndecrease in the extent of mucus secretion in colon for the exposed\ngroup.

We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as every\nresult was in the direction of showing harm.

Five studies evaluated\nbiomarkers (e.g., inflammatory cytokines) related to chronic inflammation.68,75,76,78,79 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,78 two studies were rated high or probably high\nfor two domains,75,76 and one study was rated high\nor probably high for only one domain79 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics68,76,79 and two studies tested polyethylene\nmicroplastics.75,78 Cytokines such as tumor\nnecrosis factor-α (TNF-α),\nIL-2, IL-6, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IP-10, G-CSF, iLb, Rantes, and IL-1α\nwere measured in multiple studies. TNF-α levels significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and the intestine.68 In two studies, TNF-α levels were not\nsignificantly different regardless of the exposed group in colon and\nsmall intestine.75,79 The level of IL-6 also significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and all75,79 or part68 of the small intestine. The\nlevel of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) significantly decreased\nin the colon76 but not in intestinal serum.78 There was no significant change in Ilb in the\nintestine in one study.79 IL-1α levels\nsignificantly increased in the intestine in two studies.68,78 For one study, there are two proteins related to inflammation (iNOS\nand COX-2) with levels that were significantly increased in the exposure\ngroup compared to the control.68 Eight\nother cytokines were measured in specific studies, and most of them\nhad significant changes (increase or decrease, depending on the specific\ncytokine) between control and exposure groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32).

We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polyethylene results or when only one result per\nstudy was considered versus our primary analysis of including all\nstudy results from each study. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal chronic inflammation in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Two studies75,79 measured biomarkers related to the immune system, reporting significant\nchanges in immunophenotype populations (CD4 T lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes,\nCD3+CD8+ T cells, CD19+ lymphocytes and dendritic cells, and inflammatory\nmonocytes), neutrophils (granulocytes in white blood cells), and anti-inflammatory\nmacrophages (play a critical role in inflammation). Changes in cell\npopulations may not directly relate to immunosuppression, but they\ndo relate to the immune system and could produce an immunomodulatory\neffect. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9). See Supporting Information\nFile 9 and Figure S3. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\non the basis of microplastic type or inclusion of only one result\nper study as every result was in the direction of showing harm. For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably high\nfor two domains75 and one study was rated\nhigh or probably high79 for only one domain\n(see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study\ntested polystyrene microplastics79 and\none study polyethylene microplastics.75 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal immune system function in humans on\nthe basis of (a) the “high” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Four studies examined\nmarkers indicating increased levels of oxidative stress in the colon\nand intestine.68,76,79,80 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,76 and two studies were rated high or probably\nhigh for only one domain79,80 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies tested polystyrene68,76,79 and one study polyethylene.80 Two studies76,80 found significant\nchanges for\nglutathione in the colon and intestine, three studies malondialdehyde\nconcentrations in the colon and intestine,76,79,80 and two an increase in reactive oxidative\nspecies in the intestine.68,79 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n = 12/12). We concluded that impacts of microplastic exposure\non intestinal\noxidative stress are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. One study measured hormonal changes (specifically, cholecystokinin,\nor CCK, and gastrin) in the midcolon.69 Midcolonic concentrations of CCK, which is a peptide hormone responsible\nfor the digestion of fat and protein, and gastrin, a hormone that\nstimulates gastric juice secretion, were significantly decreased.\nSee Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). For the risk of bias, this study was rated\nhigh or probably high for four domains69 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study\ntested polystyrene microplastics.69 The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00) (n = 2/2). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure\non digestive\nhormones are “not classifiable” on the basis of (a)\nthe “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality of the evidence for digestive\noutcomes as “moderate”. See Supporting\nInformation File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor the detailed rationale for these ratings.

TNF-α levels significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and the intestine.68 In two studies, TNF-α levels were not\nsignificantly different regardless of the exposed group in colon and\nsmall intestine.75,79 The level of IL-6 also significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and all75,79 or part68 of the small intestine. The\nlevel of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) significantly decreased\nin the colon76 but not in intestinal serum.78 There was no significant change in Ilb in the\nintestine in one study.79 IL-1α levels\nsignificantly increased in the intestine in two studies.68,78 For one study, there are two proteins related to inflammation (iNOS\nand COX-2) with levels that were significantly increased in the exposure\ngroup compared to the control.68 Eight\nother cytokines were measured in specific studies, and most of them\nhad significant changes (increase or decrease, depending on the specific\ncytokine) between control and exposure groups.

Five studies evaluated the effects of\nmicroplastic exposure on sperm and sperm-related outcomes.74,84−87 For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably\nhigh for four and three domains (different apical outcomes and/or\nresults with different ROB ratings),85 one\nstudy was rated high or probably high for three domains,86 one study was rated high or probably high for\nthree and two domains (different apical outcomes and/or results with\ndifferent ROB ratings),74 one study was\nrated high or probably high for two domains and one domain (different\napical outcomes and/or results with different ROB ratings),84 and one study was rated probably high for only\none domain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, all five studies tested polystyrene.74,84−87 Studies found trends in declines in living sperm, sperm concentrations,\nand sperm motility as well as increases in sperm malformation (also\nreported as sperm deformity or sperm abnormality). Outcome assessors\nwere blinded during sperm malformations and viability assessments\nin only one study.84 All studies reported\npositive associations between increasing microplastic exposure and\ndecreases in measures of sperm quality and/or quantity.

      "text": "We have identified suspected human health\nrisks from microplastic\nexposure in three body systems (digestive, reproductive, and respiratory).\nFor reproductive outcomes (sperm quality) and digestive outcomes (immunosuppression)\nwe rated the overall body of evidence as “high” quality\nand concluded microplastic exposure is “suspected” to\nadversely impact them based on consistent evidence of adverse health\neffects and confidence in the association. We downgraded the evidence\nfrom “presumed” based on the sample size and number\nof studies. For reproductive outcomes (female follicles and reproductive\nhormones), digestive outcomes (gross or microanatomic colon/small\nintestine effects, alters cell proliferation and cell death, and chronic\ninflammation), and respiratory outcomes (pulmonary function, lung\ninjury, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress) we rated the overall\nbody of evidence as “moderate” quality and concluded\nmicroplastic exposure is “suspected” to adversely impact\nthem based on consistent evidence of adverse health effects and confidence\nin the association. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is\n“unclassifiable” for birth outcomes and gestational\nage in humans based on the “low” and “very low”\nquality of the evidence. Given the ubiquity of microplastics\nand the consistent, growing\nrecognition of their existence in the human body, it is likely that\nmicroplastics will impact other body systems, which is a potential\narea for future research.100 This is a\nparticularly timely given that plastic production is projected to\ntriple by 2060.2 These findings have\nimportant implications for policy and research.\nFirst, given the indication of harm that we have identified, the need\nfor additional research on the health effects of microplastics should\nnot preclude action. We strongly recommend that regulatory agencies\nand decision makers can act on limited evidence given that evidence\nhas been shown to grow and get stronger101 and initiate actions to prevent or mitigate human exposure to microplastics.\nSecond, there is opportunity under the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency’s Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to consider microplastics\nas a class or category of chemicals102 in\nits risk evaluations, which is a key component of identifying health\nrisks for risk management actions. The U.S. Congress gave the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to jointly evaluate\nany “category of chemical substances”,103 defined as “a group of chemical substances the members\nof which are similar in molecular structure, in physical, chemical,\nor biological properties, in use, or in mode of entrance into the\nhuman body or into the environment, or the members of which are in\nsome other way suitable for classification.”104 Microplastics would meet this definition. Additionally,\nEPA could conduct a cumulative risk assessment based on their draft\napproach.105 The strengths of this\nwork include the use of established rapid\nsystematic review (rapid review) methods to accelerate the process\nof performing a full systematic review.38,39 Our rapid\nreview was guided by the Navigation Guide systematic review method,40 which has been implemented to evaluate the health\neffects of multiple chemical exposures41−43,106 and used by the World Health Organization and International Labor\nOrganization Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease\nand Injury.44 These methods represent a\ntransparent, rigorous, and unbiased approach to gathering the available\nevidence, evaluating it, and developing actionable statements for\ndecision makers. We applied the key characteristics approach,51,53,56 an approach that is in alignment\nwith the\nState of California’s current efforts to advance methods using\nbiological and mechanistic data to understand human health harms from\nexposure to chemicals.107 For the digestive\nand respiratory outcomes, we utilized the key characteristics of carcinogens.\nFor reproductive health outcomes, we utilized the key characteristics\nof reproductive toxicity.51,56 We used the concept\nof key characteristics to identify mechanisms indicative of cancer\nor reproductive toxicity.51,53,56,81 Using this approach, the greater\nthe number of key characteristics identified, the more likely the\nexposure (microplastics) was linked to these adverse health outcomes.\nWe prioritized the evidence most useful for understanding the impacts\nof microplastic exposure on human health and reported significant\nfindings on the basis of statistical relevance. We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis to test the robustness of our results when including only\none type of microplastic and only one study result per outcome in\nthe synthesis. We extrapolated microplastic exposure concentrations\nin rodent\nstudies to the predicted exposure concentrations in humans. We converted\nall microplastic concentrations (which were reported in a variety\nof ways, including micrograms per liter, micrograms, milligrams per\nkilogram, micrograms per gram, and milligrams per day) to particles\nper liter for water or particles per gram for food. Assuming an approximate\ndaily consumption rate of 5 mL of water and 5 g of food for each rodent,\na daily microplastic consumption rate was estimated unless specified\notherwise.108 To convert the units from\nmass to particles, we assumed a spherical shape and density of each\nplastic polymer under standard conditions (1.05 g/cm3 for\npolystyrene and 0.96 g/cm3 for polyethylene).109 For microplastic sizes between 5 and\n150 μm, the range of\ndaily microplastic intake for exposed rodent experiments is approximately\n7–70 000 microplastic particles, which is in range with\nthe estimated daily microplastic intake for humans (∼422 particles\nper day).110 For smaller microplastic sizes\nsuch as 0.05–0.5 μm, the range of daily exposure concentrations\nwas approximately 7 × 106 to 8.02 × 1011, which could be higher than estimated human exposure concentrations\nbut can still be informative for human health effects. There\nwere both methodological limitations and evidence base limitations\nof this review. Although the methods we employed were extremely rigorous,\nwe recognize the possibility for increased human error, particularly\nin our screening and risk of bias assessment methods in which one\nperson was screened/evaluated and another verified, which would be\nconducted in duplicate in a full systematic review. We also did not\nevaluate all outcomes reported in the included studies, nor did we\nconsider all body systems that may be impacted by microplastic exposure.\nWe further recognize that we were addressing only rodent studies and\nthat the inclusion of other species (such as zebrafish) would make\nour findings more robust. Additionally, the use of p values to identify if there was a significant harmful difference\nbetween the control and most exposed group is likely to underestimate\nthe number of outcomes where microplastic exposure leads to changes\nbetween these groups.62 However, we avoided\nplacing increased weight on statistical significance, which does not\naddress biological significance or the magnitude of the effect observed. Despite the growing body of evidence linking microplastics to adverse\nhealth outcomes, limitations in the evidence base remain. The studies\nin our rapid review are limited to primary microplastics of only three\npolymer types (polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene) and one\nsource of secondary microplastics (tire wear particles). The shape\nand size of microplastics evaluated in the included studies were also\nvery homogeneous (generally spherically shaped). The variety of microplastics\nin terms of polymer types, sizes, and shapes is much greater and may\ndifferentially impact health but has not been studied in chronic rodent\nsystems.111 We also could not account for\nadditives in the plastics or the effects of microplastics degraded\nfrom sources like fabrics given the lack of studies on these topics.\nWe could also not consider aggregate or cumulative exposures to microplastics\nand other environmental contaminants. We also did not consider the\nbiological contaminants that may attach to microplastics,112 which may impact how other environmental chemicals\nor other biological contaminants enter the human body. Our study was\nalso limited by the study population; only one study each evaluated\nsensitive life stages (e.g., child development), exacerbation by other\nstressors (e.g., poverty and food scarcity), or disease or genetic\nstatus (e.g., only healthy homogeneous rodents evaluated). Thus, we\ncould not evaluate cumulative impacts of microplastic exposure. There is a potential for publication biases. It is possible that\nstudies showing null effects of microplastic exposure were either\nnot accepted or submitted for publication or that other important\nend points in the included studies were either not measured or not\nreported. We additionally found limited human studies, which could\nreflect a lack of appropriate resource allocation to address the challenges\nof conducting epidemiological studies, or that this is a nascent area\nof research and that the follow-up time required to show the relationship\nbetween microplastics and human health effects has not been sufficient\nfor these studies to be published. As this was a rapid review, we\ndid not contact the authors for missing data. Given these limitations,\nit is likely our conclusions underestimate\nthe true health impacts of microplastic exposure. Importantly, these\nlimitations highlight that there are clear opportunities for future\nresearch, including (1) epidemiological studies and standardizing\nanalytical methods investigating the health impacts of microplastic\nexposure, (2) other health outcomes impacted by microplastic exposure,\nand (3) evaluating the impact of microplastic exposure for susceptible\nhuman populations due to their developmental stage or other socioenvironmental\nstressors. Finally, research should focus on identifying, and then\nevaluating, strategies for mitigating or preventing exposures to microplastics."

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nIn 2019, 460 million metric tons of plastic\nwere produced,1 with estimates that production\nwill triple by\n2060.1,2 The largest proportion of plastic production\ncomes from single-use plastics, and 98% of single-use plastics are\nderived from fossil fuels.3 Fossil fuels\nare used to make petrochemicals, a broad and diverse group of chemicals\nthat are the feedstock for the production of plastics.4 The petrochemical industry is pivoting to ramp up the production\nof plastics given expectations that the sales of oil and gas will\ndecrease.5,6 This has raised concern, as the production\nof plastics also contributes to greenhouse gases across their life\ncycle from cradle to grave.3,7 In addition, there is\nwell-established evidence from authoritative or systematic reviews\non the human health effects of plasticizers and plastics-related chemicals.8 For example, phthalates can increase the risk\nof preterm birth9 and adverse male reproductive\neffects10 and bisphenol A (BPA) exposure\nis likely or very likely to be a hazard for immunotoxicity, metabolic\neffects, neurotoxicity and developmental toxicity, female reproductive\ntoxicity, male reproductive toxicity, and carcinogenicity.11 Microplastics are defined as plastic particles\nthat are <5000\nμm in size and can be further classified as primary or secondary\ndepending on their source.12 Primary microplastics\nare those that are intentionally produced to serve a specific function,\nfor example, as microbeads used for exfoliation in cosmetic products.13 Secondary microplastics, in contrast, are the\nbreakdown products of larger plastic debris and can be generated by\nphysical, chemical, or biological processes. Secondary microplastics\nare more prevalent in the environment and can include, for example,\nthe microfibers that degrade from car tires, plastic bottles, and\nclothing.14 Like bulk plastic, microplastics\ncan also be a variety of polymers with different physical and chemical\nproperties.15 Microplastics are widespread\nand mobile in the environment, being\ndetected in air, surface water, costal beaches, sediment, and food.14,16,17 They have been discovered in\nremote and pristine locations, including the Antarctic,18 deep ocean trenches,19 and Arctic sea ice.20 Due to their small\nsize, microplastics more easily enter and are distributed in the human\nbody in comparison to larger particles;21 microplastics have been measured in human placenta,22 breastmilk,23 and liver.24 It has been estimated that humans consume a\n“credit card worth” of microplastics every week.25,26 Due to ubiquitous exposure23 and bioaccumulative\ncharacteristics of microplastics,17 the\nextent of human health impacts due to microplastic exposure is of\ngreat concern. Research on microplastics and their health effects\non humans is\nstill in its infancy. A growing body of evidence exists, however,\nindicating the adverse health effects of microplastic exposure on\nliving organisms.16 For example, microplastics\nincrease the susceptibility of fish and seabirds to infections.27,28 Microplastics have also been shown to accumulate in organs and lead\nto biological changes, including oxidative stress and inflammation\nin human cell lines,29,30 and exposure to microplastics\nhas been linked to poor cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes, metabolic\ndisorders, gastrointestinal effects, reproductive effects, and cancer\nin humans.29−36 Evaluations of the human health effects of microplastics have\nbeen\nnarrative nonsystematic reviews, not systematic reviews that assess\nboth the quality and strength of the existing evidence, using rigorous,\npredefined, transparent methods that minimize bias and provide a bottom\nline summary of the evidence.29−33,37 These narrative reviews, therefore,\nare able to speculate about only the association between microplastic\nexposure and human health outcomes as they do not follow prespecified,\nconsistently applied, and transparent rules like those utilized by\nsystematic reviews. Systematic reviews are thus needed to provide\nmore confidence in the evaluation of the relationship between microplastic\nexposure and health effects and to provide a conclusive statement\nregarding the implications for human toxicity. Given the growing\nbody of evidence, as well as the urgent need\nto better characterize the effects of microplastic exposure on human\nhealth, we were therefore asked to conduct a rapid systematic review\nof the evidence to assess the association of microplastic exposures\non human health outcomes for policymakers in the State of California\n(details in Materials and Methods). The primary\nobjectives of this rapid systematic review were to evaluate the human\nand animal evidence assessing microplastic exposure to any adverse\nhuman health outcome,a rate the quality and\nstrength of the human and animal evidence, integrate the human and\nanimal evidence streams and develop a final bottom line statement\nregarding the health effects of microplastics.\n\n## Materials and Methods\nThis work builds on a report\nby the California State Policy Evidence\nConsortium (CalSPEC), submitted to the State of California in 2023,16 which aimed to evaluate the impact of microplastic\nexposure on human health. CalSPEC seeks to provide rapid, well-researched\nresponses to policymakers in the State of California within a policy\ncycle, which is less than one year from the time the topic is provided\nto the report deadline. This prompted our research team to employ\nrapid systematic review methods rather than conduct a full systematic\nreview. Rapid reviews represent a type of systematic review\nthat omits\ncertain methodological steps to accelerate the process of performing\na full systematic review.38,39 This rapid review deviates\nfrom a full systematic review in three key ways. (1) After pilot screening,\none individual screened all studies, and the other individual screened\nonly excluded studies. (2) After title and abstract screening, a decision\nwas made to narrow the focus to select health outcomes (this is a\nresult of short-circuiting scoping during protocol development; however,\nwe did not look at the study results before prioritizing outcomes).\n(3) There was one risk of bias assessor and another that quality checked\ntheir decisions. This current publication expands our work on\nthe CalSPEC report\nto include an evaluation of respiratory outcomes and provides a more\ndetailed description of the methodology we used across the three body\nsystems evaluated. Our rapid review was guided by the Navigation\nGuide systematic\nreview method,40 which has been implemented\nto evaluate the health effects of multiple chemical exposures41−43 and used by the World Health Organization and International Labor\nOrganization Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease\nand Injury.44 We developed and made publicly\navailable a protocol that prespecified our methods for conducting\nthe rapid review on Open Science Framework (OSF).45 Due to the condensed time line set by CalSPEC, the review\nneeded to be conducted within a year. Therefore, we prioritized specific\nhealth outcomes for inclusion in the review. Deviations from the original\nprotocol (published on OSF October 17, 2022 OSF | The Human Health\nEffects of Microplastics) are summarized in the updated protocol (published\non OSF January 12, 2023) and below in Differences\nbetween the Protocol and Systematic Review. The objective, identified by the CalSPEC\nteam with guidance from the California State Legislature, was to answer\nthe initial research question, “What are the human health effects\nof microplastics exposure?” The “participants”,\n“exposure”, “comparator”, and “outcomes”\n(PECO) statements are outlined below. Humans and animals of any age and any health\nstatus. Any exposure to microplastics, based on our\npredefined definition of microplastics informed by the State of California,12 that occurred prior to or concurrent with diagnosis,\nexacerbation, or other measure of any health outcome. Exposures can\nbe from any route (air, water, or food), any duration, and any exposure\npathway (inhalation, ingestion, or direct contact) and can be measured\non the basis of biosamples or from exposure estimates. We defined\nmicroplastics as solid (“solid” means a substance or\nmixture that does not meet the definitions of a liquid or a gas) and\npolymeric materials [polymeric material means either (i) a particle\nof any composition with a continuous polymer surface coating of any\nthickness or (ii) a particle of any composition with a polymer content]\nto which chemical additives or other substances have been added, which\nare particles that are <5000 μm in one dimension. This definition\nis based on The State of California Water Board definition of microplastics\nin water12 with modification to include\nall microplastics without a percent content of polymers and lower\ndimension boundary requirement due to difficulty in measuring and\npotential exclusion of microplastics that come from surface coatings\nor tire wear (both of which will be included in our definition of\nMPs).15 Humans and animals exposed to lower levels\nof microplastics than the most exposed subjects or treatment groups. Any adverse health outcome was assessed. Adverse\nhealth outcomes were based on the definition from the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (“A biochemical change, functional impairment,\nor pathological lesion that affects the performance of the whole organism,\nor reduces an organism’s ability to respond to an additional\nenvironmental challenge”46) and\nCalifornia law hazard trait regulation (Title 22, Cal Code of Regs,\nDiv 4.5, Chapter 54; alternatively 22 CCR 69401 et seq) [“(a)\n“Adverse effect” for toxicological hazard traits and\nend points means a biochemical change, functional impairment, or pathologic\nlesion that negatively affects the performance of the whole organism,\nor reduces an organism’s ability to respond to an additional\nenvironmental challenge. An “adverse effect” for environmental\nhazard traits and end points means a change that negatively affects\nan ecosystem, community, assemblage, population, species, or individual\nlevel of biological organization.”47] Adverse health outcomes included systemic apical end points (e.g.,\nobservable end points such as cancer, birth defects, and organ level\neffects)48 and biological responses (e.g.,\ninfluences DNA/epigenome, oxidative stress, hormone responses, inflammation,\nimmunosuppression, and receptor mediation). Given the time line,\nwe prioritized digestive, reproductive and respiratory outcomes (see Table 1 for rationales).\nWe did not look at the study results before we made the decision to\nprioritize these outcomes. We performed a comprehensive\nsearch in partnership with a University of California, Davis, medical\nlibrarian. The search was first run on July 12, 2022, in PubMed, Embase,\nProQuest, and Web of Science and re-run on April 10–15, 2024,\nand was not restricted by year. The search strategies used in these\ndatabases are available in the protocol.45 Following the search, de-duplication of references was first conducted\nin EndNote49 and then in Excel before the\nreferences were uploaded to DistillerSR for screening, data extraction,\nand risk of bias evaluation.50 Title/abstract (T/A) and full text\nscreening was informed by our PECO statement and specific inclusion/exclusion\ncriteria. Four screeners (C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C.) reviewed references\nat T/A and then again at full text using DistillerSR.50 Following Cochrane’s Rapid Review guidance,38 C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C. independently screened\n30 of the same references at T/A to pilot the form and then continued\nto dual screen 20% of the references. Thereafter, C.B.C. and N.C.\nreviewed all of the remaining references at T/A for inclusion and\nG.B. and A.B. reviewed only references that C.B.C. and N.C. had tagged\nfor exclusion. A similar process was applied for the screening\nat full text using Cochrane’s Rapid Review guidance.38 C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C. pilot screened\nthe same five references at full text to test the form and calibrate\ntheir screening. After this, C.B.C. and N.C. screened all references\nat full text for inclusion and G.B. and A.B. verified only references\nthat C.B.C. and N.C. had tagged for exclusion. For both T/A\nand full text screening, any disagreements in terms\nof inclusion or exclusion of references were first reviewed and discussed\nbetween reviwers. If the reviewers could not reach a consensus, N.C.\nand T.J.W. served as arbitrators to make the final decision. As this was a rapid systematic\nreview, less restrictive eligibility criteria, which can be found\nin Differences between the Protocol and Systematic\nReview, was applied during the T/A screening. Ultimately, studies were included\nif they adhered to the PECO statement and met the following criteria.published in English or with an English version onlineprimary human observational studies, including,\ncohort,\ncase-control, cross-sectional, or other relevant designsexperimental animal studies such as mammalian rodent\nstudies (rats and mice)reported exposure\nto microplastics, as defined by the\nPECO statementcomparator group with\nno or lower levels of microplastic\nexposuremeasured any outcome of the\ndigestive system (excluding\ngut microbiota outcomes), reproductive system, or respiratory systemoutcomes reported quantitatively (p values and figures considered sufficient)mammalian rodents (rats and mice) exposed by oral route\nvia food and/or water (digestive and reproductive studies) or intratracheal\nor intranasal routes (respiratory studies)mammalian rodent (rats and mice) studies evaluated repeated\nexposures to microplasticsmammalian\nrodent (rats and mice) exposed to multiple\nconcentrations of microplastics (i.e., more than one exposed group) published in English or with an English version online primary human observational studies, including,\ncohort,\ncase-control, cross-sectional, or other relevant designs experimental animal studies such as mammalian rodent\nstudies (rats and mice) reported exposure\nto microplastics, as defined by the\nPECO statement comparator group with\nno or lower levels of microplastic\nexposure measured any outcome of the\ndigestive system (excluding\ngut microbiota outcomes), reproductive system, or respiratory system outcomes reported quantitatively (p values and figures considered sufficient) mammalian rodents (rats and mice) exposed by oral route\nvia food and/or water (digestive and reproductive studies) or intratracheal\nor intranasal routes (respiratory studies) mammalian rodent (rats and mice) studies evaluated repeated\nexposures to microplastics mammalian\nrodent (rats and mice) exposed to multiple\nconcentrations of microplastics (i.e., more than one exposed group) Studies were excluded if one\nor more of the following criteria were not met.does not contain original data (e.g., commentary, editorial,\nreview, etc.)in a language other than\nEnglishdoes not involve human or mammalian\nrodent (rats and\nmice) animals (i.e., cell line only, plants, non-rodent mammal studies,\nor rodents other than rats and mice)does not report exposure to microplastics, as defined\nby the PECO statementno comparator groupmammalian rodents (rats and mice) exposed\nto microplastics\nvia gavage, dermal exposures, intraperitoneal injection, caudal vein\ninjection, or intragastric administrationmammalian rodent (rats and mice) studies that evaluated\nonly one exposure group versus a controlcase report of a single participantother reasons (explanation required) does not contain original data (e.g., commentary, editorial,\nreview, etc.) in a language other than\nEnglish does not involve human or mammalian\nrodent (rats and\nmice) animals (i.e., cell line only, plants, non-rodent mammal studies,\nor rodents other than rats and mice) does not report exposure to microplastics, as defined\nby the PECO statement no comparator group mammalian rodents (rats and mice) exposed\nto microplastics\nvia gavage, dermal exposures, intraperitoneal injection, caudal vein\ninjection, or intragastric administration mammalian rodent (rats and mice) studies that evaluated\nonly one exposure group versus a control case report of a single participant other reasons (explanation required) We utilized DistillerSR for data extraction\nof study characteristics, including exposure and outcome information,\nand numerical results of the study (e.g., p values\nand dose response as reported in the studies).50 Our data extraction forms are available in the protocol\n(appendices C, D, and E).45 C.B.C., G.B.,\nand N.C. all participated in data extraction for reproductive and\ndigestive outcomes. C.B.C., G.B., N.C., A.B., and K.E.P. all extracted\ninformation about respiratory outcomes. A single reviewer extracted\nrelevant data from included studies, and a second reviewer checked\nthe extracted data for correctness and completeness.38 Any discrepancies were discussed, and N.C. and T.J.W. served\nas arbitrators in the event that a consensus could not be reached. We planned on extracting the mean and standard error from each\nstudy; however, as described in Analysis, the quantitative data were very limited due to poor reporting in\nstudies, and p values were often the only data available\nto extract. Additionally, the figures were extracted to provide Supporting Information to allow visual assessment\nof the dose response (control group compared to the largest dose of\nmicroplastics). We organized outcomes by\napical outcomes and biological changes. For the organization of biological\nchanges, we were guided by the concept of “key characteristics”.\nKey characteristics are biomarkers or mechanistic effects that comprise\nproperties of known human carcinogens or reproductive toxicants [these\ncharcteristics of carcinogens include (1) electrophilicity, (2) genotoxicity,\n(3) altering DNA repair or causeing genomic instability, (4) inducing\nepigenetic alterations, (5) inducing oxidative stress, (6) inducing\nchronic inflammation, (7) being immunosuppressive, (8) modulating\nreceptor-mediated effects, (9) causing immortalization, and (10) altering\ncell proliferation, cell death, or nutrient supply].51−57 For the digestive and respiratory outcomes, we utilized the key\ncharacteristics of carcinogens.53 For reproductive\nhealth outcomes, we utilized the key characteristics of reproductive\ntoxicity.51,56 We considered every eligible outcome\nin human studies. We prioritized the apical and biological outcomes\nlisted in Table 2 for\nanimal studies on the basis of what we considered to be the most relevant\nfor each system. We did not look at the study results before prioritizing\noutcomes. See Table 2 and Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nresults tables”) for all study results by system. We used the Navigation Guide\nrisk of bias tool to evaluate human and animal studies.41,43,58,59 In human studies, this contains nine domains: “study\ngroup representation”, “knowledge of group assignments”,\n“exposure assessment methods”, “outcome assessment\nmethods”, “confounding”, “incomplete outcome\ndata”, “selective outcome reporting”, “conflict\nof interest”, and “other”. In animal studies,\nthis tool contains seven domains that are evaluated for each study\nand/or outcome: “sequence generation”, “allocation\nconcealment”, “blinding of personnel and outcome assessors”,\n“incomplete outcome data”, “selective outcome\nreporting”, “conflict of interest”, and “other\npotential threats to validity”. We developed customized instructions\nfor evaluating the validity of how the outcome assessment was conducted\nfor the domain “other potential threats to validity”. Possible ratings for each domain were “low”, “probably\nlow”, “probably high”, or “high”\nrisk of bias, Prior to conducting risk of bias assessments, all individuals\n(C.B.C., K.E.P., G.B., N.C.) reviewed training materials from a systematic\nreview expert (J.L., listed in the acknowledgements) and our subject-matter\nexperts (G.B. and S.A.G.) discussed important criteria for considering\nthe “blinding of personnel and outcome assessors”, “incomplete\noutcome data”, and “other threats to validity”\n(how the assessment of outcomes was conducted). For more details on\nthe process of evaluating the risk of bias for each study, see the\nprotocol in ref (45). We used a single reviewer to evaluate the risk of bias (N.C.\nfor\ndigestive, respiratory, and reproductive outcomes and K.E.P. for respiratory\noutcomes) for each study by outcome, while a second reviewer (G.B.\nfor digestive and reproductive outcomes and S.A.G. and T.J.W. for\nrespiratory outcomes) verified the judgements.38 Any disagreements were first discussed between reviewers,\nwith T.J.W. serving as an arbitrator for any instances in which a\nconsensus could not be reached. The risk of bias was evaluated\non an outcome level, meaning that\ndifferent health outcomes in a study could receive different ratings\nwithin a single domain. We visually depicted and reported the ratings\nand rationales for each risk of bias domain across each study. We analyzed the result representing the effect\nof the highest level of microplastic exposure compared with the lowest\nlevel of microplastic exposure (i.e., highest concentration of microplastics\ncompared to the control group). We used the information extracted\non study characteristics to assess the comparability across studies\nand determine whether biological heterogeneity was a concern. We then\ncombined end points that were biologically similar across each system\nto synthesize results; e.g., for digestive outcomes and chronic inflammation,\nwe combined study results measuring TNF-α, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6,\nIL-9, IL-10, IP-10, IL-1α, Ifng, Il1b, G-CSF, RANTES, iNOS expression,\nCOX-2 expression, NF-kB, and mRNA expression. We planned on\nextracting the mean and standard error from each study and utilizing\na two-step analysis to conduct meta-analysis if the data were sufficiently\nhomogeneous. However, these data were not available in almost every\nstudy or too heterogeneous to combine. For example, papers reported\nonly point estimates, estimates were reported on different scales\nor used different association metrics, or the scales on the figures\nwere not fully reported preventing us from converting the results\nacross studies into a single scale. As this is a rapid review, we\ndid not contact study authors for missing data. We therefore\nused established methods of Cochrane for statistical\nsynthesis when meta-analysis of effect estimates was not possible.60 As we were unable to combine p values as there were only p values for studies\nwith statistical significance, we instead estimated the proportion\nof effects favoring the intervention along with a confidence interval\n(e.g., using the Wilson interval methods).61 Additionally, we assessed (1) the statistical significance\n(p value representing statistically significant differences\nbetween control and the most exposed group at follow-up) and (2) whether\na dose–response relationship was identified for each outcome\nincluded. For each synthesis that has concluded microplastics\nharm human\nhealth, we visually display the results included in the synthesis\nby adapting a Harvest plot to include the direction of effect, p value, and significance (e.g., <0.001, <0.01, ≤0.05,\nor >0.05), whether a dose response was identified, and the sample\nsize of the study. However, we were unable to conduct subgroup analysis\nor meta-regression to explore heterogeneity in the study results. We classified outcomes as showing harm from microplastic exposure\nif there was a change in effect in between the most exposed group\nand the non-exposed/least exposed group in the direction indicating\nharm (between group analysis). We acknowledge that our approach\nhas limitations; however, we have\navoided placing increased weight on statistical significance that\ndoes not address biological significance or the magnitude of the effect\nobserved.62 For outcomes for which we did\nnot conclude that microplastics harm human health, we narratively\npresent the results for each outcome. We conducted a sensitivity analysis\nto test the robustness of our results when including only one type\nof microplastic and only one study result per outcome to the synthesis,\nas per Cochrane guidance.63 For studies\nthat had multiple (more than two) eligible study results for an outcome\n(e.g., for the outcome “induction of chronic inflammation”,\na study measured and reported both IL-6 and TNFα), we randomly\nselected one result. We used two proportion Z tests\nto measure statistically significant differences between proportions\nof effects [i.e., one type of microplastic (e.g., polystyrene only)\nvs another type of microplastic (e.g., polyethylene only) and/or when\nonly one study result per outcome was included in the synthesis versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results for each study\nper outcome in the synthesis] at the 0.05 level (two-tailed). We assessed\nthe overall quality of the body of evidence for each health effect.\nEvidence from human studies was initially rated “moderate”,\nand for experimental animal studies, the quality of each body of evidence\nwas initially rated “high” on the basis of a previously\ndescribed rationale (see Figure 1).43,64 As animals can be randomized\nbefore being exposed to toxic hazards like microplastics, this eliminates\nselection bias and the potential influence of confounding, and they\nare therefore started at a higher level of certainty. The rating of\nthe quality of each body of evidence was then adjusted on the basis\nof eight factors and could ultimately be rated as “high”,\n“moderate”, “low”, or “very low”.\nThe quality of each body of evidence could be downgraded by five factors:\n“risk of bias across studies”, “indirectness”,\n“inconsistency”, “imprecision”, and “publication\nbias”. The quality of each body of evidence could be upgraded\nby three factors: “large magnitude of effect”, “dose\nresponse”, and “accounting for confounding that might\nminimize the effect” (Figure 1). The possible ratings for each downgrade or upgrade\nfactor were 0 (no change from the initial quality rating), −1\n(one-level downgrade), −2 (two-level downgrade), +1 (one-level\nupgrade), or +2 (two-level upgrade). Review authors (C.B.C., N.C.,\nG.B., K.E.P., T.J.W., and S.A.G.) independently evaluated the quality\nof the evidence across studies, and then ratings were compared as\na group. We recorded (and present) the consensus and rationale for\neach factor and each final decision. Evaluating the quality and strength of\nthe body of evidence using\nNavigation Guide. We rated the overall strength\nof the body of evidence (Figure 1) on the basis of four considerations: (1) “quality\nof the body of evidence”, (2) “direction of effect estimates”,\n(3) “confidence in the effect” (considering factors\nsuch as the number and size of studies), and (4) “any other\ncompelling attributes of the data that may influence certainty”.\nThis informed the final hazard conclusion statements, which were guided\nby the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and\nTranslation (NTP OHAT) approach.64 There\nwere four possible conclusions regarding the risk of microplastic\nexposure to humans outlined in Figure 2: (1) “known” to be a hazard to humans,\n(2) “presumed” to be a hazard to humans, (3) “suspected”\nto be a hazard to humans, and (4) “not classifiable”\nas a hazard to humans. Hazard identification conclusion statements informed by\nthe NTP\nOHAT approach.\n\n## Study Question\nThe objective, identified by the CalSPEC\nteam with guidance from the California State Legislature, was to answer\nthe initial research question, “What are the human health effects\nof microplastics exposure?” The “participants”,\n“exposure”, “comparator”, and “outcomes”\n(PECO) statements are outlined below. Humans and animals of any age and any health\nstatus. Any exposure to microplastics, based on our\npredefined definition of microplastics informed by the State of California,12 that occurred prior to or concurrent with diagnosis,\nexacerbation, or other measure of any health outcome. Exposures can\nbe from any route (air, water, or food), any duration, and any exposure\npathway (inhalation, ingestion, or direct contact) and can be measured\non the basis of biosamples or from exposure estimates. We defined\nmicroplastics as solid (“solid” means a substance or\nmixture that does not meet the definitions of a liquid or a gas) and\npolymeric materials [polymeric material means either (i) a particle\nof any composition with a continuous polymer surface coating of any\nthickness or (ii) a particle of any composition with a polymer content]\nto which chemical additives or other substances have been added, which\nare particles that are <5000 μm in one dimension. This definition\nis based on The State of California Water Board definition of microplastics\nin water12 with modification to include\nall microplastics without a percent content of polymers and lower\ndimension boundary requirement due to difficulty in measuring and\npotential exclusion of microplastics that come from surface coatings\nor tire wear (both of which will be included in our definition of\nMPs).15 Humans and animals exposed to lower levels\nof microplastics than the most exposed subjects or treatment groups. Any adverse health outcome was assessed. Adverse\nhealth outcomes were based on the definition from the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency (“A biochemical change, functional impairment,\nor pathological lesion that affects the performance of the whole organism,\nor reduces an organism’s ability to respond to an additional\nenvironmental challenge”46) and\nCalifornia law hazard trait regulation (Title 22, Cal Code of Regs,\nDiv 4.5, Chapter 54; alternatively 22 CCR 69401 et seq) [“(a)\n“Adverse effect” for toxicological hazard traits and\nend points means a biochemical change, functional impairment, or pathologic\nlesion that negatively affects the performance of the whole organism,\nor reduces an organism’s ability to respond to an additional\nenvironmental challenge. An “adverse effect” for environmental\nhazard traits and end points means a change that negatively affects\nan ecosystem, community, assemblage, population, species, or individual\nlevel of biological organization.”47] Adverse health outcomes included systemic apical end points (e.g.,\nobservable end points such as cancer, birth defects, and organ level\neffects)48 and biological responses (e.g.,\ninfluences DNA/epigenome, oxidative stress, hormone responses, inflammation,\nimmunosuppression, and receptor mediation). Given the time line,\nwe prioritized digestive, reproductive and respiratory outcomes (see Table 1 for rationales).\nWe did not look at the study results before we made the decision to\nprioritize these outcomes.\n\n## PECO Statement for Human and Animal Evidence\nHumans and animals of any age and any health\nstatus.

Given the time line,\nwe prioritized digestive, reproductive and respiratory outcomes (see Table 1 for rationales).\nWe did not look at the study results before we made the decision to\nprioritize these outcomes.\n\n## Study Search Strategy\nWe performed a comprehensive\nsearch in partnership with a University of California, Davis, medical\nlibrarian. The search was first run on July 12, 2022, in PubMed, Embase,\nProQuest, and Web of Science and re-run on April 10–15, 2024,\nand was not restricted by year. The search strategies used in these\ndatabases are available in the protocol.45 Following the search, de-duplication of references was first conducted\nin EndNote49 and then in Excel before the\nreferences were uploaded to DistillerSR for screening, data extraction,\nand risk of bias evaluation.50\n\n## Study Selection\nTitle/abstract (T/A) and full text\nscreening was informed by our PECO statement and specific inclusion/exclusion\ncriteria. Four screeners (C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C.) reviewed references\nat T/A and then again at full text using DistillerSR.50 Following Cochrane’s Rapid Review guidance,38 C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C. independently screened\n30 of the same references at T/A to pilot the form and then continued\nto dual screen 20% of the references. Thereafter, C.B.C. and N.C.\nreviewed all of the remaining references at T/A for inclusion and\nG.B. and A.B. reviewed only references that C.B.C. and N.C. had tagged\nfor exclusion. A similar process was applied for the screening\nat full text using Cochrane’s Rapid Review guidance.38 C.B.C., G.B., A.B., and N.C. pilot screened\nthe same five references at full text to test the form and calibrate\ntheir screening. After this, C.B.C. and N.C. screened all references\nat full text for inclusion and G.B. and A.B. verified only references\nthat C.B.C. and N.C. had tagged for exclusion. For both T/A\nand full text screening, any disagreements in terms\nof inclusion or exclusion of references were first reviewed and discussed\nbetween reviwers. If the reviewers could not reach a consensus, N.C.\nand T.J.W. served as arbitrators to make the final decision.\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\nAs this was a rapid systematic\nreview, less restrictive eligibility criteria, which can be found\nin Differences between the Protocol and Systematic\nReview, was applied during the T/A screening. Ultimately, studies were included\nif they adhered to the PECO statement and met the following criteria.published in English or with an English version onlineprimary human observational studies,

characteristics, including exposure and outcome information,\nand numerical results of the study (e.g., p values\nand dose response as reported in the studies).50 Our data extraction forms are available in the protocol\n(appendices C, D, and E).45 C.B.C., G.B.,\nand N.C. all participated in data extraction for reproductive and\ndigestive outcomes. C.B.C., G.B., N.C., A.B., and K.E.P. all extracted\ninformation about respiratory outcomes. A single reviewer extracted\nrelevant data from included studies, and a second reviewer checked\nthe extracted data for correctness and completeness.38 Any discrepancies were discussed, and N.C. and T.J.W. served\nas arbitrators in the event that a consensus could not be reached. We planned on extracting the mean and standard error from each\nstudy; however, as described in Analysis, the quantitative data were very limited due to poor reporting in\nstudies, and p values were often the only data available\nto extract. Additionally, the figures were extracted to provide Supporting Information to allow visual assessment\nof the dose response (control group compared to the largest dose of\nmicroplastics).\n\n## Types of Outcome Measures\nWe organized outcomes by\napical outcomes and biological changes. For the organization of biological\nchanges, we were guided by the concept of “key characteristics”.\nKey characteristics are biomarkers or mechanistic effects that comprise\nproperties of known human carcinogens or reproductive toxicants [these\ncharcteristics of carcinogens include (1) electrophilicity, (2) genotoxicity,\n(3) altering DNA repair or causeing genomic instability, (4) inducing\nepigenetic alterations, (5) inducing oxidative stress, (6) inducing\nchronic inflammation, (7) being immunosuppressive, (8) modulating\nreceptor-mediated effects, (9) causing immortalization, and (10) altering\ncell proliferation, cell death, or nutrient supply].51−57 For the digestive and respiratory outcomes, we utilized the key\ncharacteristics of carcinogens.53 For reproductive\nhealth outcomes, we utilized the key characteristics of reproductive\ntoxicity.51,56 We considered every eligible outcome\nin human studies. We prioritized the apical and biological outcomes\nlisted in Table 2 for\nanimal studies on the basis of what we considered to be the most relevant\nfor each system. We did not look at the study results before prioritizing\noutcomes. See Table 2 and Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nresults tables”) for all study results by system.\n\n## Rate the Quality and Strength of the Evidence\nWe used the Navigation Guide\nrisk of bias tool to evaluate human and animal studies.41,43,58,59 In human studies, this contains nine domains: “study\ngroup representation”, “knowledge of group assignments”,\n“exposure assessment methods”, “outcome assessment\nmethods”, “confounding”, “incomplete outcome\ndata”, “selective outcome reporting”, “conflict\nof interest”, and “other”. In animal studies,\nthis tool contains seven domains that are evaluated for each study\nand/or outcome: “sequence generation”, “allocation\nconcealment”, “blinding of personnel and outcome assessors”,\n“incomplete outcome data”, “selective outcome\nreporting”, “conflict of interest”, and “other\npotential threats to validity”. We developed customized instructions\nfor evaluating the validity of how the outcome assessment was conducted\nfor the domain “other potential threats to validity”. Possible ratings for each domain were “low”, “probably\nlow”, “probably high”, or “high”\nrisk of bias, Prior to conducting risk of bias assessments, all individuals\n(C.B.C., K.E.P., G.B., N.C.) reviewed training materials from a systematic\nreview expert (J.L., listed in the acknowledgements) and our subject-matter\nexperts (G.B. and S.A.G.) discussed important criteria for considering\nthe “blinding of personnel and outcome assessors”, “incomplete\noutcome data”, and “other threats to validity”\n(how the assessment of outcomes was conducted). For more details on\nthe process of evaluating the risk of bias for each study, see the\nprotocol in ref (45). We used a single reviewer to evaluate the risk of bias (N.C.\nfor\ndigestive, respiratory, and reproductive outcomes and K.E.P. for respiratory\noutcomes) for each study by outcome, while a second reviewer (G.B.\nfor digestive and reproductive outcomes and S.A.G. and T.J.W. for\nrespiratory outcomes) verified the judgements.38 Any disagreements were first discussed between reviewers,\nwith T.J.W. serving as an arbitrator for any instances in which a\nconsensus could not be reached. The risk of bias was evaluated\non an outcome level, meaning that\ndifferent health outcomes in a study could receive different ratings\nwithin a single domain. We visually depicted and reported the ratings\nand rationales for each risk of bias domain across each study.\n\n## Assessing the Risk of Bias\nWe used the Navigation Guide\nrisk of bias tool to evaluate human and animal studies.41,43,58,59 In human studies, this contains nine domains: “study\ngroup representation”, “knowledge of group assignments”,\n“exposure assessment methods”, “outcome assessment\nmethods”, “confounding”, “incomplete outcome\ndata”, “selective outcome reporting”, “conflict\nof interest”, and “other”. In animal studies,\nthis tool contains seven domains that are evaluated for each study\nand/or outcome: “sequence generation”, “allocation\nconcealment”, “blinding of personnel and outcome assessors”,\n“incomplete outcome data”, “selective outcome\nreporting”, “conflict of interest”, and “other\npotential threats to validity”. We developed customized instructions\nfor evaluating the validity of how the outcome assessment was conducted\nfor the domain “other potential threats to validity”. Possible ratings for each domain were “low”, “probably\nlow”, “probably high”, or “high”\nrisk of bias, Prior to conducting risk of bias assessments, all individuals\n(C.B.C., K.E.P., G.B., N.C.) reviewed training materials from a systematic\nreview expert (J.L., listed in the acknowledgements) and our subject-matter\nexperts (G.B. and S.A.G.) discussed important criteria for considering\nthe “blinding of personnel and outcome assessors”, “incomplete\noutcome data”, and “other threats to validity”\n(how the assessment of outcomes was conducted). For more details on\nthe process of evaluating the risk of bias for each study, see the\nprotocol in ref (45). We used a single reviewer to evaluate the risk of bias (N.C.\nfor\ndigestive, respiratory, and reproductive outcomes and K.E.P. for respiratory\noutcomes) for each study by outcome, while a second reviewer (G.B.\nfor digestive and reproductive outcomes and S.A.G. and T.J.W. for\nrespiratory outcomes) verified the judgements.38 Any disagreements were first discussed between reviewers,\nwith T.J.W. serving as an arbitrator for any instances in which a\nconsensus could not be reached. The risk of bias was evaluated\non an outcome level, meaning that\ndifferent health outcomes in a study could receive different ratings\nwithin a single domain. We visually depicted and reported the ratings\nand rationales for each risk of bias domain across each study.\n\n## Analysis\nWe analyzed the result representing the effect\nof the highest level of microplastic exposure compared with the lowest\nlevel of microplastic exposure (i.e., highest concentration of microplastics\ncompared to the control group). We used the information extracted\non study characteristics to assess the comparability across studies\nand determine whether biological heterogeneity was a concern. We then\ncombined end points that were biologically similar across each system\nto synthesize results; e.g., for digestive outcomes and chronic inflammation,\nwe combined study results measuring TNF-α, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6,\nIL-9, IL-10, IP-10, IL-1α, Ifng, Il1b, G-CSF, RANTES, iNOS expression,\nCOX-2 expression, NF-kB, and mRNA expression. We planned on\nextracting the mean and standard error from each study and utilizing\na two-step analysis to conduct meta-analysis if the data were sufficiently\nhomogeneous. However, these data were not available in almost every\nstudy or too heterogeneous to combine. For example, papers reported\nonly point estimates, estimates were reported on different scales\nor used different association metrics, or the scales on the figures\nwere not fully reported preventing us from converting the results\nacross studies into a single scale. As this is a rapid review, we\ndid not contact study authors for missing data. We therefore\nused established methods of Cochrane for statistical\nsynthesis when meta-analysis of effect estimates was not possible.60 As we were unable to combine p values as there were only p values for studies\nwith statistical significance, we instead estimated the proportion\nof effects favoring the intervention along with a confidence interval\n(e.g., using the Wilson interval methods).61 Additionally, we assessed (1) the statistical significance\n(p value representing statistically significant differences\nbetween control and the most exposed group at follow-up) and (2) whether\na dose–response relationship was identified for each outcome\nincluded. For each synthesis that has concluded microplastics\nharm human\nhealth, we visually display the results included in the synthesis\nby adapting a Harvest plot to include the direction of effect, p value, and significance (e.g., <0.001, <0.01, ≤0.05,\nor >0.05), whether a dose response was identified, and the sample\nsize of the study. However, we were unable to conduct subgroup analysis\nor meta-regression to explore heterogeneity in the study results. We classified outcomes as showing harm from microplastic exposure\nif there was a change in effect in between the most exposed group\nand the non-exposed/least exposed group in the direction indicating\nharm (between group analysis). We acknowledge that our approach\nhas limitations; however, we have\navoided placing increased weight on statistical significance that\ndoes not address biological significance or the magnitude of the effect\nobserved.62 For outcomes for which we did\nnot conclude that microplastics harm human health, we narratively\npresent the results for each outcome.\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis\nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis\nto test the robustness of our results when including only one type\nof microplastic and only one study result per outcome to the synthesis,\nas per Cochrane guidance.63 For studies\nthat had multiple (more than two) eligible study results for an outcome\n(e.g., for the outcome “induction of chronic inflammation”,\na study measured and reported both IL-6 and TNFα), we randomly\nselected one result. We used two proportion Z tests\nto measure statistically significant differences between proportions\nof effects [i.e., one type of microplastic (e.g., polystyrene only)\nvs another type of microplastic (e.g., polyethylene only) and/or when\nonly one study result per outcome was included in the synthesis versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results for each study\nper outcome in the synthesis] at the 0.05 level (two-tailed). We assessed\nthe overall quality of the body of evidence for each health effect.\nEvidence from human studies was initially rated “moderate”,\nand for experimental animal studies, the quality of each body of evidence\nwas initially rated “high” on the basis of a previously\ndescribed rationale (see Figure 1).43,64 As animals can be randomized\nbefore being exposed to toxic hazards like microplastics, this eliminates\nselection bias and the potential influence of confounding, and they\nare therefore started at a higher level of certainty. The rating of\nthe quality of each body of evidence was then adjusted on the basis\nof eight factors and could ultimately be rated as “high”,\n“moderate”, “low”, or “very low”.\nThe quality of each body of evidence could be downgraded by five factors:\n“risk of bias across studies”, “indirectness”,\n“inconsistency”, “imprecision”, and “publication\nbias”. The quality of each body of evidence could be upgraded\nby three factors: “large magnitude of effect”, “dose\nresponse”, and “accounting for confounding that might\nminimize the effect” (Figure 1). The possible ratings for each downgrade or upgrade\nfactor were 0 (no change from the initial quality rating), −1\n(one-level downgrade), −2 (two-level downgrade), +1 (one-level\nupgrade), or +2 (two-level upgrade). Review authors (C.B.C., N.C.,\nG.B., K.E.P., T.J.W., and S.A.G.) independently evaluated the quality\nof the evidence across studies, and then ratings were compared as\na group. We recorded (and present) the consensus and rationale for\neach factor and each final decision. Evaluating the quality and strength of\nthe body of evidence using\nNavigation Guide. We rated the overall strength\nof the body of evidence (Figure 1) on the basis of four considerations: (1) “quality\nof the body of evidence”, (2) “direction of effect estimates”,\n(3) “confidence in the effect” (considering factors\nsuch as the number and size of studies), and (4) “any other\ncompelling attributes of the data that may influence certainty”.\nThis informed the final hazard conclusion statements, which were guided\nby the National Toxicology Program Office of Health Assessment and\nTranslation (NTP OHAT) approach.64 There\nwere four possible conclusions regarding the risk of microplastic\nexposure to humans outlined in Figure 2: (1) “known” to be a hazard to humans,\n(2) “presumed” to be a hazard to humans, (3) “suspected”\nto be a hazard to humans, and (4) “not classifiable”\nas a hazard to humans.

The second search identified an additional\n1042 studies, with 14 included (three human and 11 animal). See Supporting Information File 2 (“List of\nexcluded studies and reasons for exclusion at full text review”). Three human cross-sectional\nobservational studies examined reproductive (n =\n2) and respiratory (n = 1) outcomes, and 28 experimental\nanimal studies examined reproductive (n = 11), respiratory\n(n = 7), and digestive (n = 10)\noutcomes. Human studies were published from 2022 to 2024.\nTotal study populations ranged from 40 to 80. Human studies were conducted\nin Turkey (n = 1), Iran (n = 1),\nand China (n = 1). Microplastics were measured in\nmaternal amniotic fluid (n = 1), placenta (n = 1), and nasal lavage fluid (n = 1).\nMicroplastics were characterized by polymer type in two (66%) of the\nstudies. Polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethyleneterephthalate, polypropylene,\nchlorinated polyethylene, polyamide, and others were detected. Animal studies were published from 2018 to 2024\nand were mostly conducted in China [n = 22(79%)].\nMost of the animal studies [n = 22(79%)] were conducted\nin mice with 15–180 rodents per study. The total number of\nrodents per exposure group ranged from five to 45. The number of exposure\ngroups ranged from two to four per study. See Supporting Information File 3 (“List of included studies\nand study characteristics”). In animals, microplastics\nwere administered through ingestion in water [n =\n16 (57%)], in food [n = 5 (18%)], or via inhalation\n[n = 7(25%)]. Microplastics in inhalation studies\nwere suspended in air, water, or saline with various methods of delivery,\nincluding, for example, intranasal inhalation and intratracheal instillation.\nExposures lasted from 14 days to 32 weeks. Nearly all exposures were\nin adult aged animals, with mice in two reproductive studies being\nexposed during early life development (i.e., during gestation or during\ngestation and postnatal development). There was little variability\nin study design and the types, sizes, and shapes of the microplastics\nacross the 28 animal studies. The type of microplastic used was overwhelmingly\npolystyrene [n = 22(79%)]. The size of microplastics\nadministered was between 0.1 and 467.85 μm. Animal studies\ncovering digestive and respiratory outcomes were\nconducted in China, France, and the Republic of Korea, and reproductive\noutcome studies were conducted in China, Pakistan, and Canada. Some\npublications were produced by the same lab group, raising the possibility\nthat errors in the method or approach might be propagated across multiple\nstudies. Two lab groups produced two digestive papers each,68−71 while another published three reproductive papers.72−74 See Tables 3–6 for included\nhuman and animal studies with further details in Supporting Information Files 3 and 4. The outcomes column does not contain\nall of the outcomes in the study, only the outcomes prioritized for\ndata extraction. See Supporting Information\nFile 5 (“Risk of bias heat map for summaries of risk\nof bias judgments”) for the studies included in our systematic\nreview of microplastic exposure. Risk of bias heat maps are provided\nfor each outcome (digestive, reproductive, and respiratory) for each\nevidence stream (human and animal). Risk of bias designations for\nindividual studies are assigned according to criteria provided in\nthe protocol,45 and the justification for\neach study is provided in Supporting Information\nFile 6 (“Risk of bias ratings and justification”). There were no human studies examining\nthis outcome. We evaluated six outcomes across 10 studies relating\nto the small or large intestines of the digestive tract, focusing\non apical end points (in this case, gross or microanatomic colonic\nand small intestinal effects) and biological outcomes grouped into\nthe following key characteristics of carcinogens: oxidative stress,\nchronic inflammation, immunosuppression, receptor-mediated effects\n(hormones), and cell proliferation (e.g., goblet cell count). Similar measurements were conducted between studies; however, not\nall measurements were the same, and estimates could not be combined\nin a meta-analysis or visually displayed collectively in a figure\nbecause estimates were reported on different scales, used different\nassociation metrics, or were not fully reported. Six studies\nevaluated apical measurements on the digestive tract, including colon\nlength, villus length, and other histopathological measurements of\nthe colon and small intestine69−71,75−77 (see Supporting Information File\n4, “Study Results”). For the risk of bias,\none study was high or probably high for five domains,69 one study was high or probably high for two and three domains\n(different apical outcomes with different ROB ratings),76 three studies were high or probably high for\ntwo domains,70,71,75 and one study was high or probably high for one domain77 (see Supporting Information\nFiles 5, “Risk of bias heat map”, and 6 for justification of ratings). For microplastic\ntype, five studies tested polystyrene69−71,76,77 and one tested polyethylene microplastics.75 One study76 observed significant alterations\nto the colon, including changes in the muscular layer width. The same\nstudy also found significant colon shortening in the exposed group.\nAnother study75 observed significant differences\nin crypt depth but not the villus length in the proximal and distal\nsmall intestines for the most exposed group (which throughout this\nsection will often be termed the “exposed group”). The\nsame study also observed a significant increase in the mucosal surface\narea in the colon epithelium but found opposite or no significant\nchange in staining with neutral and acid mucins in different parts\nof the digestive system. The third study69 found a significant decrease in multiple histopathological end points.\nThe fourth study71 found a significant\ndecrease in the extent of mucus secretion in colon for the exposed\ngroup. The fifth found a significant decrease in the thickness of\nthe mucosa layer of the small intestine.77 The final study found a significant decrease of the alcian blue-periodic\nacid Schiff (AB/PAS) solution positive area (area with mucins) in\nall microplastic exposure groups compared to control (unexposed) but\ndid not exhibit a dose response effect across the groups.70 The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful equals 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.85–1.00]\n[n = 22 (positive study results)/22 (total study\nresults)] [see Figure 3 for (1) the direction of the effect, (2) p values,\n(3) the dose response, and (4) the study sample size for included\nstudies in this synthesis]. Apical outcomes (colon and small intestine). We conducted a sensitivity analysis and (1) compared\nthe estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n =\n12/12) versus polyethylene microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.72–1.00)\n(n = 10/10) and (2) compared the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful when only one result per study was\nconsidered = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.61–1.00) (n = 6/6) versus our primary analysis of including all study results\nfrom each study = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.85–1.00) (n = 22/22). See Supporting Information File 7 (“Sensitivity analysis”). We found no difference\nin the proportions of effects between polystyrene\nmicroplastics and polyethylene microplastics, and we found no difference\nin the proportions of the effect between our analysis of only one\nresult per study being considered versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study. We concluded that exposure\nto microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact the colon and small intestine in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n[see Supporting Information File 8 (“Evidence\nratings for studies”) for a detailed rationale for these ratings],\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association, considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Two studies assessed cell proliferation and death.69,76 For the risk of bias, one study was high or probably high\nfor five domains69 and one high or probably\nhigh for three domains76 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, both studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics.\nThe first study showed a significant decrease in the number in crypts\nof Lieberkuhn (intestinal mucosal glands) and goblet cells (cells\nthat secrete mucin) in the exposed group.69 The second study also found a significant decrease in the number\nof goblet cells.76 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n = 3/3). See Supporting Information File 9 (“Graphical display of results”) and Figure S1. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as every\nresult was in the direction of showing harm. We concluded that\nexposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal cell proliferation and cell death in\nhumans on the basis of (a) the “moderate” quality of\nthe body of evidence (see Supporting Information\nFile 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”), (b)\nthe direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Five studies evaluated\nbiomarkers (e.g., inflammatory cytokines) related to chronic inflammation.68,75,76,78,79 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,78 two studies were rated high or probably high\nfor two domains,75,76 and one study was rated high\nor probably high for only one domain79 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics68,76,79 and two studies tested polyethylene\nmicroplastics.75,78 Cytokines such as tumor\nnecrosis factor-α (TNF-α),\nIL-2, IL-6, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IP-10, G-CSF, iLb, Rantes, and IL-1α\nwere measured in multiple studies. TNF-α levels significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and the intestine.68 In two studies, TNF-α levels were not\nsignificantly different regardless of the exposed group in colon and\nsmall intestine.75,79 The level of IL-6 also significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and all75,79 or part68 of the small intestine. The\nlevel of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) significantly decreased\nin the colon76 but not in intestinal serum.78 There was no significant change in Ilb in the\nintestine in one study.79 IL-1α levels\nsignificantly increased in the intestine in two studies.68,78 For one study, there are two proteins related to inflammation (iNOS\nand COX-2) with levels that were significantly increased in the exposure\ngroup compared to the control.68 Eight\nother cytokines were measured in specific studies, and most of them\nhad significant changes (increase or decrease, depending on the specific\ncytokine) between control and exposure groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32). See Supporting Information File 9\nand Figure S2. We conducted a sensitivity analysis and\n(1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n =\n12/12) versus polyethylene microplastics = 0.90 (95% CI of 0.70–97)\n(n = 18/20) (difference between proportions p = 0.26) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.51–1.00) (n = 4/4) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.61) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polyethylene results or when only one result per\nstudy was considered versus our primary analysis of including all\nstudy results from each study. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal chronic inflammation in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Two studies75,79 measured biomarkers related to the immune system, reporting significant\nchanges in immunophenotype populations (CD4 T lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes,\nCD3+CD8+ T cells, CD19+ lymphocytes and dendritic cells, and inflammatory\nmonocytes), neutrophils (granulocytes in white blood cells), and anti-inflammatory\nmacrophages (play a critical role in inflammation). Changes in cell\npopulations may not directly relate to immunosuppression, but they\ndo relate to the immune system and could produce an immunomodulatory\neffect. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9). See Supporting Information\nFile 9 and Figure S3. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\non the basis of microplastic type or inclusion of only one result\nper study as every result was in the direction of showing harm. For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably high\nfor two domains75 and one study was rated\nhigh or probably high79 for only one domain\n(see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study\ntested polystyrene microplastics79 and\none study polyethylene microplastics.75 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal immune system function in humans on\nthe basis of (a) the “high” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Four studies examined\nmarkers indicating increased levels of oxidative stress in the colon\nand intestine.68,76,79,80 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,76 and two studies were rated high or probably\nhigh for only one domain79,80 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies tested polystyrene68,76,79 and one study polyethylene.80 Two studies76,80 found significant\nchanges for\nglutathione in the colon and intestine, three studies malondialdehyde\nconcentrations in the colon and intestine,76,79,80 and two an increase in reactive oxidative\nspecies in the intestine.68,79 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n = 12/12). We concluded that impacts of microplastic exposure\non intestinal\noxidative stress are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. One study measured hormonal changes (specifically, cholecystokinin,\nor CCK, and gastrin) in the midcolon.69 Midcolonic concentrations of CCK, which is a peptide hormone responsible\nfor the digestion of fat and protein, and gastrin, a hormone that\nstimulates gastric juice secretion, were significantly decreased.\nSee Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). For the risk of bias, this study was rated\nhigh or probably high for four domains69 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study\ntested polystyrene microplastics.69 The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00) (n = 2/2). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure\non digestive\nhormones are “not classifiable” on the basis of (a)\nthe “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality of the evidence for digestive\noutcomes as “moderate”. See Supporting\nInformation File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor the detailed rationale for these ratings. Across the outcomes,\nwe identified that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto be a digestive hazard to humans, including a suspected link to\ncolon cancer, using the key characteristics of carcinogens approach.53,81 We evaluated two outcomes across two\nstudies related to the reproductive system.35,36 Both studies evaluated the growth outcome\nbirth weight, one finding a statistically significant correlation\nwith microplastic load in the placenta and reduced birth weight35 and the other no difference with microplastic\nload in amniotic fluid.36 One study found\na statistically significant correlation with microplastic load in\nthe placenta and reduced birth length and head circumference.35 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.75\n(95% CI of 0.30–0.95) (n = 3/4). For\nthe risk of bias, one study was rated high risk of bias for\nthe domain of confounding and rated probably high risk of bias for\nknowledge of group assignments (blinding),35 and one study was rated probably high risk of bias for selection\nof study groups and knowledge of group assignments36 [see Supporting Information File 5 (“Risk of bias heat map”) and Supporting Information File 6 for justification of ratings]. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor birth outcomes in humans on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting\nInformation File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”,\nfor a detailed rationale for these ratings), (b) the direction of\nthe effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse health effect\nwith an increasing level of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence\nin the association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study measured the associations\nbetween total microplastic abundance in maternal amniotic fluid and\ngestational age, finding a statistically significant decrease in age\nfor a unit (particles per gram) increase in microplastics.36 See Supporting Information\nFile 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful = 1.00\n(95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1). For\nthe risk of bias, this study was rated probably high risk of\nbias for the domains selection of study groups and knowledge of group\nassignments36 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not\nclassifiable”\nfor gestational age development in humans on the basis of (a) the\n“low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. We evaluated 10 outcomes across 11 studies\nrelated to the reproductive system. Four studies72,73,82,83 evaluated\nfemale end points (including hormone level changes in the serum and\novaries and impacts to ovarian follicles), and five studies74,84−87 evaluated male end points (including sperm damage, testicular damage,\nand serum hormone level changes). One study evaluated oocyte meiotic\nprogression/blatstocyst development.82 Four\nevaluated separate birth outcomes (weight of fetus and placenta, litter\nsize, anogenital index, and distance).82,86−88 One study evaluated age at puberty.87 Studies that assessed hormone levels in the serum and ovaries were\nalso included, as hormonal changes are a key characteristic of reproductive\ntoxicants that may also impact reproductive health directly.51,56,81 Similar measurements were\nconducted between studies; however, not all measurements were the\nsame, and estimates could not be combined in a meta-analysis or visually\ndisplayed collectively in a figure because estimates were reported\non different scales, used different association metrics, or were not\nfully reported. One study88 evaluated birth outcomes by measuring the weight of the\nfetus and placenta. They found a statistically significant decrease\nin the weight of the fetus between the most and least exposed groups,\nbut not for the weight of the placenta. See Supporting\nInformation File 4 (“Study Results”). The\nestimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful\n= 0.50 (95% CI of 0.09–0.91) (n = 1/2). For the risk of bias, this study was rated probably high for two\ndomains (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type,\nthis study tested polystyrene. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor birth outcomes of the weight of the fetus and placenta on the\nbasis of (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. Two studies82,86 evaluated\nthe birth outcome of litter size. One study found a statistically\nsignificant difference in the number of offspring between the most\nand least exposed groups.82 One study found\nno difference in litter size or post-survival rate.86 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.33 (95% CI of 0.06–0.79)\n(n = 1/3). For the risk of bias, both studies\nwere rated high or probably\nhigh for three domains82,86 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study tested polystyrene87 and polyethylene.82 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not\nclassifiable”\nfor the birth outcome of litter size on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for\nstudies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited\nconfidence in the association considering factors including the number\nand size of studies. One study87 evaluated age at puberty and found a statistically significant decrease\nin onset between the most and least exposed groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00)\n(n = 1/1). For the risk of bias, this study\nwas rated probably high for one\ndomain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polystyrene.87 We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “not classifiable”\nfor the onset of puberty on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study82 evaluated oocyte meiotic progression/blatstocyst\ndevelopment and found a statistically significant percentage decrease\nin both outcomes between the least and most exposed groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00)\n(n = 2/2). For the risk of bias, this study\nwas rated high or probably high\nfor three domains82 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polyethylene.82 We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “not classifiable”\nfor effect meiotic progression/blatstocyst development on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. One study89 measured testicular aging across seven measures and saw a consistent\nstatistically significant effect in each one. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.65–1.00) (n = 7/7). For the risk of bias, this study was rated high or\nprobably high\nfor three domains (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, this study tested polystyrene microplastics. We concluded\nthat exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor testicular aging on the basis of (a) the “very low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study87 measured anogenital index and distance in two\nsets of pups, postnatal day 35 and 70, and found no significant difference\nbetween the least and most exposed groups for either end point or\npostnatal day. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.50 (95%\nCI of 0.15–0.85) (n = 2/4). For the\nrisk of bias, this study was rated probably high for one\ndomain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polystyrene. We\nconcluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor anogenital index and distance on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for\nstudies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited\nconfidence in the association considering factors including the number\nand size of studies. Five studies evaluated the effects of\nmicroplastic exposure on sperm and sperm-related outcomes.74,84−87 For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably\nhigh for four and three domains (different apical outcomes and/or\nresults with different ROB ratings),85 one\nstudy was rated high or probably high for three domains,86 one study was rated high or probably high for\nthree and two domains (different apical outcomes and/or results with\ndifferent ROB ratings),74 one study was\nrated high or probably high for two domains and one domain (different\napical outcomes and/or results with different ROB ratings),84 and one study was rated probably high for only\none domain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, all five studies tested polystyrene.74,84−87 Studies found trends in declines in living sperm, sperm concentrations,\nand sperm motility as well as increases in sperm malformation (also\nreported as sperm deformity or sperm abnormality). Outcome assessors\nwere blinded during sperm malformations and viability assessments\nin only one study.84 All studies reported\npositive associations between increasing microplastic exposure and\ndecreases in measures of sperm quality and/or quantity. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00) (n = 9/9). See Supporting Information File 8 and Figure S4. We did not conduct a sensitivity\nanalysis as all studies were in the direction of showing harm. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact sperm quality and testicular health in humans\non the basis of (a) the “high” quality of the body of\nevidence (Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”), (b) the direction\nof the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse health effect\nwith an increasing level of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence\nin the association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. See Supporting Information File 7 (“Evidence ratings for studies”) for a detailed rationale\nfor these ratings. One study84 evaluated the effects of microplastic exposure on germinal\ncell thickness and found a significant decrease and dose–response\neffects between control and exposure groups.84 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00)\n(n = 1/1). This study was rated high or probably\nhigh for two domains. This study tested polystyrene. We\nconcluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor germinal thickness on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. Two studies evaluated\nthe effects of microplastic exposure on ovarian follicles.72,73 For the risk of bias, both studies were rated high or probably\nhigh for three domains72,73 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, both studies tested polystyrene.72,73 Both studies found a significant decrease in the number of\ngrowing\nfollicles for the most exposed group and a consistent dose–response\nrelationship. For both studies, five random visual fields were used\nto assess the number of growing follicles via microscope imaging for\neach rat model (six from each group). It is unclear whether five images\nwere sufficient to qualitatively assess the measurement, but the authors\ndo refer to previous literature for their methodology. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00) (n = 2/2). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S5. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as both\nstudies tested polystyrene and each study contributed only one study\nresult for the outcome. We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “suspected”\nto adversely impact ovarian follicle development in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence,\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Six studies measured alterations\nof reproductive hormones.72,73,82−84,87 For the risk\nof bias, two studies were rated high or probably high for four domains,82,83 two studies were rated high or probably high for two domains,72,73 and two studies were rated high or probably high for one domain84,87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, five studies\ntested polystyrene72,73,83,84,87 and one study\ntested polyethylene.82 Two studies\nfound significant changes in anti-Müllerian\nhormone (AMH) concentration: one in serum73 and the other in ovaries.72 One study\nfound significant changes in Inhibin in pups postnatal day 35 and\n70.87 Four studies measured luteinizing\nhormone (LH),82−84,87 but only one found\nsignificant decreases in the level of serum LH.84 Two studies found no significant changes in progesterone.82,83 Three of four studies found significant changes in follicle-stimulating\nhormone (FSH).83,84,87 Three studies found significant changes in testosterone concentrations.83,84,87 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.77 (95% CI of 0.57–0.90) (n = 17/22). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S6. We conducted a sensitivity analysis and\n(1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.78 (95% CI of 0.55–0.91) (n =\n14/18) versus polyethylene microplastics = 0.75 (95% CI of 0.30–95)\n(n = 3/4) (difference between proportions p = 0.90) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 0.83 (95% CI of 0.44–0.97) (n = 5/6) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.77 (95% CI of 0.57–0.90) (n = 17/22) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.75) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and polyethylene results or when only one result per study\nwas considered versus our primary analysis of including all study\nresults from each study. We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “suspected”\nto adversely impact reproductive hormones in humans on the basis of\n(a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence,\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality\nof the evidence for these outcomes\nas “moderate”. See Supporting Information File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”) for a\ndetailed rationale for these ratings. Across the\noutcomes that were fully evaluated, we identified that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected” to be a hazard to the human\nreproductive system. We evaluated one study91 that measured the relationship between chronic rhinosinusitis\nwithout nasal polyps and microplastics and found a statistically significant\ndifference in the level of microplastics in patients with chronic\nrhinosinusitis without nasal polyps compared to healthy volunteers. The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1). For the risk of bias, this study was rated high for\nconfounding\nand probably high for study group selection and exposure assessment\n(see Supporting Information File 5, “Risk\nof bias heat map”, and Supporting Information File 6 for justification of ratings). We concluded that\nexposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor chronic rhinosinusitis in humans on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence, (b) the direction of\nthe effect, and (c) the limited confidence in the association considering\nfactors including the number and size of studies. We evaluated five outcomes across seven\nstudies related to the respiratory system. Four studies92−95 evaluated total cell count (total cells, macrophages, lymphocytes,\nneutrophils, and polymorphonuclear cells). Three studies measured92,93,95 pulmonary function (pressure–volume\nloops, peak expiratory flows, tissue dampening, tissue elastance,\ncentral airway resistance, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory\nvolume, tidal volume, minute volume, inspiratory time, expiratory\ntime, peak inspiratory flow, and peak expiratory flow). Four studies93−96 evaluated lung injury (lung tissue score, pulmonary parenchymal\narea, average vessel thickness, and number of alveolar septa). Three studies evaluated biomarkers related to chronic inflammation\n(IL-6 secretions, TNF-α secretions, IL-8 secretions, IL-1β\nsecretions, TGF-β). Three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers for lung fibrosis (vimentin,\nα-SMA, surfactant protein-C, MCP-1, and Krebs von den lungen-6\n& KC) resulting from inflammation, and three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers related\nto oxidative stress (ROS, SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT). Similar measurements\nwere conducted between studies; however, not\nall measurements were the same, and estimates could not be combined\nin a meta-analysis or visually displayed collectively in a figure\nbecause estimates were reported on different scales, used different\nassociation metrics, or were not fully reported. Three studies92,93,95 evaluated pulmonary function (pressure–volume\nloops, peak expiratory flows, tissue dampening, tissue elastance,\ncentral airway resistance, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory\nvolume, tidal volume, minute volume, inspiratory time, expiratory\ntime, peak inspiratory flow, and peak expiratory flow) and found decreased\nforced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1). See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.83 (95% CI of 0.63–0.93)\n(n = 19/23). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S7. For the risk of bias, three studies\nwere rated high/probably high\nfor two domains92,9395 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, two studies\ntested polystyrene92,93,95 and one tested tire wear microplastic\nparticles.93 We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.73 (95% CI of 0.48–0.89) (n =\n11/15) versus tire wear microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.68–1.00)\n(n = 8/8) (difference between proportions p = 0.11) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n = 3/3) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.83 (95% CI of 0.63–0.93) (n = 19/23) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.43) (Supporting Information File 7). We found polystyrene\nmicroplastics had a lower estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing harm versus tire wear microplastics;\nhowever, the difference was not statistically significant. We found\nwhen only one result per study was considered, the estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful was greater\nversus our primary analysis of including all study results from each\nstudy; however, the difference was not statistically significant. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact pulmonary function in humans on the basis of (a)\nthe “moderate” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”, for a detailed rationale for these ratings),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Four studies93−96 evaluated lung injury (lung tissue\nscore, pulmonary parenchymal area, average vessel thickness, number\nof alveolar septa, and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia) and found\nconsistent effects indicating damage and fibrosis to the lung tissue.\nThese findings are consistent with lung tissue damage. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 0.88 (95% CI of 0.53–0.98)\n(n = 7/8). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S8. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 for three domains,93 and two were rated high/probably high for two\ndomains95,96 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, two studies tested polystyrene,95,96 one tested\npolypropylene,94 and one tested\ntire wear microplastic particles93 We conducted a sensitivity analysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n =\n3/3) versus polypropylene = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1) and versus tire wear microplastics = 1.00 (95%\nCI of 0.51–1.00) (n = 4/4) and (2) measured\nthe proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful when only\none result per study was considered = 0.75 (95% CI of 0.30–0.95)\n(n = 3/4) versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study = 0.88 (95% CI of 0.53–0.98)\n(n = 7/8) (difference between proportions p = 0.57) (Supporting Information File 7). We found no difference in the estimate of the proportion\nof effects\nshowing harm between polystyrene versus polyethylene microplastics\nand between polystyrene versus tire ware microplastics. We found when\nonly one result per study was considered, the estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful was lower versus our\nprimary analysis of including all study results from each study; however,\nthe difference was not statistically significant. We concluded\nthat exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto cause lung injury on the basis of (a) the “moderate”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Four studies92−95 evaluated total cell counts (total\ncells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and polymorphonuclear\ncells). For the risk of bias, one study was rated high/probably\nhigh across four domains,94 one was rated\nhigh/probably high for two domains,95 two\nwere rated high/probably high for one domain92 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, two studies tested polystyrene,92,95 one tested polypropylene,94 and one tested\ntire wear microplastic particles.93 Two\nstudies found a decrease in the number of macrophages that were statistically\nsignificant.93,95 Three studies found an increase\nin the total number of cells and lymphocytes.93−95 Two studies\nfound a statistically significant increase in the number of neutrophils.94,95 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.74 (95% CI of 0.54–0.87) (n = 17/23). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure on\ntotal cell counts are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “very low” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Five studies92,94,95,98,99 evaluated biomarkers related to chronic inflammation\n(IL-6 secretions, TNF-α secretions, IL-8 secretions, IL-1β\nsecretions and TGF-β) and resultant lung fibrosis (vimentin,\nα-SMA, surfactant protein-C, Krebs von den lungen-6, and MCP-1)\nand found increased levels of measured biomarkers in mice exposed\nto microplastics consistent with inflammation and lung fibrosis. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 0.96 (95% CI of 0.82–0.99)\n(n = 27/28). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S9. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 one study was rated high/probably\nhigh in three domains,97 and three studies\nwere rated high/probably high for two domains92,95,98 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, four studies tested polystyrene92,95,98,97 and one tested polypropylene94 microplastics. We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.96 (95% CI of 0.79–0.99) (n =\n22/23) versus polypropylene microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.57–1.00)\n(n = 5/5) (difference between proportions p = 0.64) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.57–1.00) (n = 5/5) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.96 (95% CI of 0.82–0.99) (n = 27/28) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.64) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polypropylene results or when only one result\nper study was considered versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study. We concluded that exposure\nto microplastics is “suspected”\nto induce chronic inflammation and lung fibrosis in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers related to oxidative\nstress (ROS, SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT) and found that the decrease in\nthe levels of SOD, GSH/PX, and CAT and the increase in the level of\nROS are consistent with oxidative stress in the lung. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S10. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 one study was rated high/probably\nhigh in three domains,97 and one study\nwas rated high/probably high for two domains95 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\nas every result was in the direction of showing harm. For the\nmicroplastic type, two studies tested polystyrene95,97 and one tested polypropylene94 microplastics. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto induce oxidative stress on the basis of (a) the “moderate”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality\nof the evidence for these outcomes\nas “moderate” quality. See Supporting Information File 7 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor a detailed rationale for these ratings. Across the\noutcomes that were fully evaluated, we identified that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected” to be a hazard to the human\nrespiratory system.\n\n## Characteristics of Included Studies\nThree human cross-sectional\nobservational studies examined reproductive (n =\n2) and respiratory (n = 1) outcomes, and 28 experimental\nanimal studies examined reproductive (n = 11), respiratory\n(n = 7), and digestive (n = 10)\noutcomes. Human studies were published from 2022 to 2024.\nTotal study populations ranged from 40 to 80. Human studies were conducted\nin Turkey (n = 1), Iran (n = 1),\nand China (n = 1). Microplastics were measured in\nmaternal amniotic fluid (n = 1), placenta (n = 1), and nasal lavage fluid (n = 1).\nMicroplastics were characterized by polymer type in two (66%) of the\nstudies. Polystyrene, polyethylene, polyethyleneterephthalate, polypropylene,\nchlorinated polyethylene, polyamide, and others were detected. Animal studies were published from 2018 to 2024\nand were mostly conducted in China [n = 22(79%)].\nMost of the animal studies [n = 22(79%)] were conducted\nin mice with 15–180 rodents per study. The total number of\nrodents per exposure group ranged from five to 45. The number of exposure\ngroups ranged from two to four per study. See Supporting Information File 3 (“List of included studies\nand study characteristics”). In animals, microplastics\nwere administered through ingestion in water [n =\n16 (57%)], in food [n = 5 (18%)], or via inhalation\n[n = 7(25%)]. Microplastics in inhalation studies\nwere suspended in air, water, or saline with various methods of delivery,\nincluding, for example, intranasal inhalation and intratracheal instillation.\nExposures lasted from 14 days to 32 weeks. Nearly all exposures were\nin adult aged animals, with mice in two reproductive studies being\nexposed during early life development (i.e., during gestation or during\ngestation and postnatal development). There was little variability\nin study design and the types, sizes, and shapes of the microplastics\nacross the 28 animal studies. The type of microplastic used was overwhelmingly\npolystyrene [n = 22(79%)]. The size of microplastics\nadministered was between 0.1 and 467.85 μm. Animal studies\ncovering digestive and respiratory outcomes were\nconducted in China, France, and the Republic of Korea, and reproductive\noutcome studies were conducted in China, Pakistan, and Canada. Some\npublications were produced by the same lab group, raising the possibility\nthat errors in the method or approach might be propagated across multiple\nstudies. Two lab groups produced two digestive papers each,68−71 while another published three reproductive papers.72−74 See Tables 3–6 for included\nhuman and animal studies with further details in Supporting Information Files 3 and 4. The outcomes column does not contain\nall of the outcomes in the study, only the outcomes prioritized for\ndata extraction.\n\n## Human\nHuman studies were published from 2022 to 2024.\nTotal study populations ranged from 40 to 80.

The outcomes column does not contain\nall of the outcomes in the study, only the outcomes prioritized for\ndata extraction.\n\n## Risk of Bias\nSee Supporting Information\nFile 5 (“Risk of bias heat map for summaries of risk\nof bias judgments”) for the studies included in our systematic\nreview of microplastic exposure. Risk of bias heat maps are provided\nfor each outcome (digestive, reproductive, and respiratory) for each\nevidence stream (human and animal). Risk of bias designations for\nindividual studies are assigned according to criteria provided in\nthe protocol,45 and the justification for\neach study is provided in Supporting Information\nFile 6 (“Risk of bias ratings and justification”).\n\n## Digestive Results\nThere were no human studies examining\nthis outcome. We evaluated six outcomes across 10 studies relating\nto the small or large intestines of the digestive tract, focusing\non apical end points (in this case, gross or microanatomic colonic\nand small intestinal effects) and biological outcomes grouped into\nthe following key characteristics of carcinogens: oxidative stress,\nchronic inflammation, immunosuppression, receptor-mediated effects\n(hormones), and cell proliferation (e.g., goblet cell count). Similar measurements were conducted between studies; however, not\nall measurements were the same, and estimates could not be combined\nin a meta-analysis or visually displayed collectively in a figure\nbecause estimates were reported on different scales, used different\nassociation metrics, or were not fully reported. Six studies\nevaluated apical measurements on the digestive tract, including colon\nlength, villus length, and other histopathological measurements of\nthe colon and small intestine69−71,75−77 (see Supporting Information File\n4, “Study Results”). For the risk of bias,\none study was high or probably high for five domains,69 one study was high or probably high for two and three domains\n(different apical outcomes with different ROB ratings),76 three studies were high or probably high for\ntwo domains,70,71,75 and one study was high or probably high for one domain77 (see Supporting Information\nFiles 5, “Risk of bias heat map”, and 6 for justification of ratings). For microplastic\ntype, five studies tested polystyrene69−71,76,77 and one tested polyethylene microplastics.75 One study76 observed significant alterations\nto the colon, including changes in the muscular layer width. The same\nstudy also found significant colon shortening in the exposed group.\nAnother study75 observed significant differences\nin crypt depth but not the villus length in the proximal and distal\nsmall intestines for the most exposed group (which throughout this\nsection will often be termed the “exposed group”). The\nsame study also observed a significant increase in the mucosal surface\narea in the colon epithelium but found opposite or no significant\nchange in staining with neutral and acid mucins in different parts\nof the digestive system. The third study69 found a significant decrease in multiple histopathological end points.\nThe fourth study71 found a significant\ndecrease in the extent of mucus secretion in colon for the exposed\ngroup. The fifth found a significant decrease in the thickness of\nthe mucosa layer of the small intestine.77 The final study found a significant decrease of the alcian blue-periodic\nacid Schiff (AB/PAS) solution positive area (area with mucins) in\nall microplastic exposure groups compared to control (unexposed) but\ndid not exhibit a dose response effect across the groups.70 The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful equals 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.85–1.00]\n[n = 22 (positive study results)/22 (total study\nresults)] [see Figure 3 for (1) the direction of the effect, (2) p values,\n(3) the dose response, and (4) the study sample size for included\nstudies in this synthesis]. Apical outcomes (colon and small intestine). We conducted a sensitivity analysis and (1) compared\nthe estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n =\n12/12) versus polyethylene microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.72–1.00)\n(n = 10/10) and (2) compared the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful when only one result per study was\nconsidered = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.61–1.00) (n = 6/6) versus our primary analysis of including all study results\nfrom each study = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.85–1.00) (n = 22/22). See Supporting Information File 7 (“Sensitivity analysis”). We found no difference\nin the proportions of effects between polystyrene\nmicroplastics and polyethylene microplastics, and we found no difference\nin the proportions of the effect between our analysis of only one\nresult per study being considered versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study. We concluded that exposure\nto microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact the colon and small intestine in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n[see Supporting Information File 8 (“Evidence\nratings for studies”) for a detailed rationale for these ratings],\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association, considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Two studies assessed cell proliferation and death.69,76 For the risk of bias, one study was high or probably high\nfor five domains69 and one high or probably\nhigh for three domains76 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, both studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics.\nThe first study showed a significant decrease in the number in crypts\nof Lieberkuhn (intestinal mucosal glands) and goblet cells (cells\nthat secrete mucin) in the exposed group.69 The second study also found a significant decrease in the number\nof goblet cells.76 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n = 3/3). See Supporting Information File 9 (“Graphical display of results”) and Figure S1. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as every\nresult was in the direction of showing harm. We concluded that\nexposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal cell proliferation and cell death in\nhumans on the basis of (a) the “moderate” quality of\nthe body of evidence (see Supporting Information\nFile 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”), (b)\nthe direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Five studies evaluated\nbiomarkers (e.g., inflammatory cytokines) related to chronic inflammation.68,75,76,78,79 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,78 two studies were rated high or probably high\nfor two domains,75,76 and one study was rated high\nor probably high for only one domain79 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics68,76,79 and two studies tested polyethylene\nmicroplastics.75,78 Cytokines such as tumor\nnecrosis factor-α (TNF-α),\nIL-2, IL-6, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IP-10, G-CSF, iLb, Rantes, and IL-1α\nwere measured in multiple studies. TNF-α levels significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and the intestine.68 In two studies, TNF-α levels were not\nsignificantly different regardless of the exposed group in colon and\nsmall intestine.75,79 The level of IL-6 also significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and all75,79 or part68 of the small intestine. The\nlevel of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) significantly decreased\nin the colon76 but not in intestinal serum.78 There was no significant change in Ilb in the\nintestine in one study.79 IL-1α levels\nsignificantly increased in the intestine in two studies.68,78 For one study, there are two proteins related to inflammation (iNOS\nand COX-2) with levels that were significantly increased in the exposure\ngroup compared to the control.68 Eight\nother cytokines were measured in specific studies, and most of them\nhad significant changes (increase or decrease, depending on the specific\ncytokine) between control and exposure groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32). See Supporting Information File 9\nand Figure S2. We conducted a sensitivity analysis and\n(1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n =\n12/12) versus polyethylene microplastics = 0.90 (95% CI of 0.70–97)\n(n = 18/20) (difference between proportions p = 0.26) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.51–1.00) (n = 4/4) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.61) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polyethylene results or when only one result per\nstudy was considered versus our primary analysis of including all\nstudy results from each study. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal chronic inflammation in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Two studies75,79 measured biomarkers related to the immune system, reporting significant\nchanges in immunophenotype populations (CD4 T lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes,\nCD3+CD8+ T cells, CD19+ lymphocytes and dendritic cells, and inflammatory\nmonocytes), neutrophils (granulocytes in white blood cells), and anti-inflammatory\nmacrophages (play a critical role in inflammation). Changes in cell\npopulations may not directly relate to immunosuppression, but they\ndo relate to the immune system and could produce an immunomodulatory\neffect. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9). See Supporting Information\nFile 9 and Figure S3. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\non the basis of microplastic type or inclusion of only one result\nper study as every result was in the direction of showing harm. For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably high\nfor two domains75 and one study was rated\nhigh or probably high79 for only one domain\n(see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study\ntested polystyrene microplastics79 and\none study polyethylene microplastics.75 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal immune system function in humans on\nthe basis of (a) the “high” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Four studies examined\nmarkers indicating increased levels of oxidative stress in the colon\nand intestine.68,76,79,80 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,76 and two studies were rated high or probably\nhigh for only one domain79,80 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies tested polystyrene68,76,79 and one study polyethylene.80 Two studies76,80 found significant\nchanges for\nglutathione in the colon and intestine, three studies malondialdehyde\nconcentrations in the colon and intestine,76,79,80 and two an increase in reactive oxidative\nspecies in the intestine.68,79 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n = 12/12). We concluded that impacts of microplastic exposure\non intestinal\noxidative stress are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. One study measured hormonal changes (specifically, cholecystokinin,\nor CCK, and gastrin) in the midcolon.69 Midcolonic concentrations of CCK, which is a peptide hormone responsible\nfor the digestion of fat and protein, and gastrin, a hormone that\nstimulates gastric juice secretion, were significantly decreased.\nSee Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). For the risk of bias, this study was rated\nhigh or probably high for four domains69 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study\ntested polystyrene microplastics.69 The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00) (n = 2/2). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure\non digestive\nhormones are “not classifiable” on the basis of (a)\nthe “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality of the evidence for digestive\noutcomes as “moderate”. See Supporting\nInformation File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor the detailed rationale for these ratings. Across the outcomes,\nwe identified that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto be a digestive hazard to humans, including a suspected link to\ncolon cancer, using the key characteristics of carcinogens approach.53,81\n\n## Apical Outcomes (colon and small intestine)\nSix studies\nevaluated apical measurements on the digestive tract, including colon\nlength, villus length, and other histopathological measurements of\nthe colon and small intestine69−71,75−77 (see Supporting Information File\n4, “Study Results”). For the risk of bias,\none study was high or probably high for five domains,69 one study was high or probably high for two and three domains\n(different apical outcomes with different ROB ratings),76 three studies were high or probably high for\ntwo domains,70,71,75 and one study was high or probably high for one domain77 (see Supporting Information\nFiles 5, “Risk of bias heat map”, and 6 for justification of ratings). For microplastic\ntype, five studies tested polystyrene69−71,76,77 and one tested polyethylene microplastics.75 One study76 observed significant alterations\nto the colon, including changes in the muscular layer width. The same\nstudy also found significant colon shortening in the exposed group.\nAnother study75 observed significant differences\nin crypt depth but not the villus length in the proximal and distal\nsmall intestines for the most exposed group (which throughout this\nsection will often be termed the “exposed group”). The\nsame study also observed a significant increase in the mucosal surface\narea in the colon epithelium but found opposite or no significant\nchange in staining with neutral and acid mucins in different parts\nof the digestive system. The third study69 found a significant decrease in multiple histopathological end points.\nThe fourth study71 found a significant\ndecrease in the extent of mucus secretion in colon for the exposed\ngroup. The fifth found a significant decrease in the thickness of\nthe mucosa layer of the small intestine.77 The final study found a significant decrease of the alcian blue-periodic\nacid Schiff (AB/PAS) solution positive area (area with mucins) in\nall microplastic exposure groups compared to control (unexposed) but\ndid not exhibit a dose response effect across the groups.70 The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful equals 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.85–1.00]\n[n = 22 (positive study results)/22 (total study\nresults)] [see Figure 3 for (1) the direction of the effect, (2) p values,\n(3) the dose response, and (4) the study sample size for included\nstudies in this synthesis]. Apical outcomes (colon and small intestine). We conducted a sensitivity analysis and (1) compared\nthe estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n =\n12/12) versus polyethylene microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.72–1.00)\n(n = 10/10) and (2) compared the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful when only one result per study was\nconsidered = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.61–1.00) (n = 6/6) versus our primary analysis of including all study results\nfrom each study = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.85–1.00) (n = 22/22). See Supporting Information File 7 (“Sensitivity analysis”). We found no difference\nin the proportions of effects between polystyrene\nmicroplastics and polyethylene microplastics, and we found no difference\nin the proportions of the effect between our analysis of only one\nresult per study being considered versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study. We concluded that exposure\nto microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact the colon and small intestine in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n[see Supporting Information File 8 (“Evidence\nratings for studies”) for a detailed rationale for these ratings],\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association, considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies.\n\n## Biological Changes (key characteristics)\nTwo studies assessed cell proliferation and death.69,76 For the risk of bias, one study was high or probably high\nfor five domains69 and one high or probably\nhigh for three domains76 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, both studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics.\nThe first study showed a significant decrease in the number in crypts\nof Lieberkuhn (intestinal mucosal glands) and goblet cells (cells\nthat secrete mucin) in the exposed group.69 The second study also found a significant decrease in the number\nof goblet cells.76 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n = 3/3). See Supporting Information File 9 (“Graphical display of results”) and Figure S1. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as every\nresult was in the direction of showing harm. We concluded that\nexposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal cell proliferation and cell death in\nhumans on the basis of (a) the “moderate” quality of\nthe body of evidence (see Supporting Information\nFile 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”), (b)\nthe direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Five studies evaluated\nbiomarkers (e.g., inflammatory cytokines) related to chronic inflammation.68,75,76,78,79 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,78 two studies were rated high or probably high\nfor two domains,75,76 and one study was rated high\nor probably high for only one domain79 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics68,76,79 and two studies tested polyethylene\nmicroplastics.75,78 Cytokines such as tumor\nnecrosis factor-α (TNF-α),\nIL-2, IL-6, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IP-10, G-CSF, iLb, Rantes, and IL-1α\nwere measured in multiple studies. TNF-α levels significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and the intestine.68 In two studies, TNF-α levels were not\nsignificantly different regardless of the exposed group in colon and\nsmall intestine.75,79 The level of IL-6 also significantly\nincreased in the colon76 and all75,79 or part68 of the small intestine. The\nlevel of IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) significantly decreased\nin the colon76 but not in intestinal serum.78 There was no significant change in Ilb in the\nintestine in one study.79 IL-1α levels\nsignificantly increased in the intestine in two studies.68,78 For one study, there are two proteins related to inflammation (iNOS\nand COX-2) with levels that were significantly increased in the exposure\ngroup compared to the control.68 Eight\nother cytokines were measured in specific studies, and most of them\nhad significant changes (increase or decrease, depending on the specific\ncytokine) between control and exposure groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32). See Supporting Information File 9\nand Figure S2. We conducted a sensitivity analysis and\n(1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n =\n12/12) versus polyethylene microplastics = 0.90 (95% CI of 0.70–97)\n(n = 18/20) (difference between proportions p = 0.26) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.51–1.00) (n = 4/4) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.94 (95% CI of 0.80–0.98) (n = 30/32) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.61) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polyethylene results or when only one result per\nstudy was considered versus our primary analysis of including all\nstudy results from each study. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal chronic inflammation in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Two studies75,79 measured biomarkers related to the immune system, reporting significant\nchanges in immunophenotype populations (CD4 T lymphocytes, CD8 T lymphocytes,\nCD3+CD8+ T cells, CD19+ lymphocytes and dendritic cells, and inflammatory\nmonocytes), neutrophils (granulocytes in white blood cells), and anti-inflammatory\nmacrophages (play a critical role in inflammation). Changes in cell\npopulations may not directly relate to immunosuppression, but they\ndo relate to the immune system and could produce an immunomodulatory\neffect. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9). See Supporting Information\nFile 9 and Figure S3. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\non the basis of microplastic type or inclusion of only one result\nper study as every result was in the direction of showing harm. For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably high\nfor two domains75 and one study was rated\nhigh or probably high79 for only one domain\n(see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study\ntested polystyrene microplastics79 and\none study polyethylene microplastics.75 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact intestinal immune system function in humans on\nthe basis of (a) the “high” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Four studies examined\nmarkers indicating increased levels of oxidative stress in the colon\nand intestine.68,76,79,80 For the risk of bias, one study was\nrated high or probably high for four domains,68 one study was rated high or probably high for three domains,76 and two studies were rated high or probably\nhigh for only one domain79,80 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, three studies tested polystyrene68,76,79 and one study polyethylene.80 Two studies76,80 found significant\nchanges for\nglutathione in the colon and intestine, three studies malondialdehyde\nconcentrations in the colon and intestine,76,79,80 and two an increase in reactive oxidative\nspecies in the intestine.68,79 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.76–1.00) (n = 12/12). We concluded that impacts of microplastic exposure\non intestinal\noxidative stress are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. One study measured hormonal changes (specifically, cholecystokinin,\nor CCK, and gastrin) in the midcolon.69 Midcolonic concentrations of CCK, which is a peptide hormone responsible\nfor the digestion of fat and protein, and gastrin, a hormone that\nstimulates gastric juice secretion, were significantly decreased.\nSee Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). For the risk of bias, this study was rated\nhigh or probably high for four domains69 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study\ntested polystyrene microplastics.69 The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00) (n = 2/2). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure\non digestive\nhormones are “not classifiable” on the basis of (a)\nthe “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality of the evidence for digestive\noutcomes as “moderate”. See Supporting\nInformation File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor the detailed rationale for these ratings. Across the outcomes,\nwe identified that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto be a digestive hazard to humans, including a suspected link to\ncolon cancer, using the key characteristics of carcinogens approach.53,81\n\n## Alterations of Cell Proliferation, Cell Death, or Nutrient Supply\nTwo studies assessed cell proliferation and death.69,76 For the risk of bias, one study was high or probably high\nfor five domains69 and one high or probably\nhigh for three domains76 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, both studies\ntested polystyrene microplastics.\nThe first study showed a significant decrease in the number in crypts\nof Lieberkuhn (intestinal mucosal glands) and goblet cells (cells\nthat secrete mucin) in the exposed group.69 The second study also found a significant decrease in the number\nof goblet cells.76 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n = 3/3). See Supporting Information File 9 (“Graphical display of results”) and Figure S1. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as every\nresult was in the direction of showing harm.

We considered the overall quality of the evidence for digestive\noutcomes as “moderate”. See Supporting\nInformation File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor the detailed rationale for these ratings.\n\n## Conclusion about Digestive Studies\nAcross the outcomes,\nwe identified that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto be a digestive hazard to humans, including a suspected link to\ncolon cancer, using the key characteristics of carcinogens approach.53,81\n\n## Reproductive Results\nWe evaluated two outcomes across two\nstudies related to the reproductive system.35,36 Both studies evaluated the growth outcome\nbirth weight, one finding a statistically significant correlation\nwith microplastic load in the placenta and reduced birth weight35 and the other no difference with microplastic\nload in amniotic fluid.36 One study found\na statistically significant correlation with microplastic load in\nthe placenta and reduced birth length and head circumference.35 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.75\n(95% CI of 0.30–0.95) (n = 3/4). For\nthe risk of bias, one study was rated high risk of bias for\nthe domain of confounding and rated probably high risk of bias for\nknowledge of group assignments (blinding),35 and one study was rated probably high risk of bias for selection\nof study groups and knowledge of group assignments36 [see Supporting Information File 5 (“Risk of bias heat map”) and Supporting Information File 6 for justification of ratings]. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor birth outcomes in humans on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting\nInformation File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”,\nfor a detailed rationale for these ratings), (b) the direction of\nthe effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse health effect\nwith an increasing level of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence\nin the association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study measured the associations\nbetween total microplastic abundance in maternal amniotic fluid and\ngestational age, finding a statistically significant decrease in age\nfor a unit (particles per gram) increase in microplastics.36 See Supporting Information\nFile 4 (“Study Results”).

Four studies72,73,82,83 evaluated\nfemale end points (including hormone level changes in the serum and\novaries and impacts to ovarian follicles), and five studies74,84−87 evaluated male end points (including sperm damage, testicular damage,\nand serum hormone level changes). One study evaluated oocyte meiotic\nprogression/blatstocyst development.82 Four\nevaluated separate birth outcomes (weight of fetus and placenta, litter\nsize, anogenital index, and distance).82,86−88 One study evaluated age at puberty.87 Studies that assessed hormone levels in the serum and ovaries were\nalso included, as hormonal changes are a key characteristic of reproductive\ntoxicants that may also impact reproductive health directly.51,56,81 Similar measurements were\nconducted between studies; however, not all measurements were the\nsame, and estimates could not be combined in a meta-analysis or visually\ndisplayed collectively in a figure because estimates were reported\non different scales, used different association metrics, or were not\nfully reported. One study88 evaluated birth outcomes by measuring the weight of the\nfetus and placenta. They found a statistically significant decrease\nin the weight of the fetus between the most and least exposed groups,\nbut not for the weight of the placenta. See Supporting\nInformation File 4 (“Study Results”). The\nestimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful\n= 0.50 (95% CI of 0.09–0.91) (n = 1/2). For the risk of bias, this study was rated probably high for two\ndomains (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type,\nthis study tested polystyrene. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor birth outcomes of the weight of the fetus and placenta on the\nbasis of (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. Two studies82,86 evaluated\nthe birth outcome of litter size. One study found a statistically\nsignificant difference in the number of offspring between the most\nand least exposed groups.82 One study found\nno difference in litter size or post-survival rate.86 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.33 (95% CI of 0.06–0.79)\n(n = 1/3). For the risk of bias, both studies\nwere rated high or probably\nhigh for three domains82,86 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study tested polystyrene87 and polyethylene.82 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not\nclassifiable”\nfor the birth outcome of litter size on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for\nstudies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited\nconfidence in the association considering factors including the number\nand size of studies. One study87 evaluated age at puberty and found a statistically significant decrease\nin onset between the most and least exposed groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00)\n(n = 1/1). For the risk of bias, this study\nwas rated probably high for one\ndomain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polystyrene.87 We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “not classifiable”\nfor the onset of puberty on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study82 evaluated oocyte meiotic progression/blatstocyst\ndevelopment and found a statistically significant percentage decrease\nin both outcomes between the least and most exposed groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00)\n(n = 2/2). For the risk of bias, this study\nwas rated high or probably high\nfor three domains82 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polyethylene.82 We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “not classifiable”\nfor effect meiotic progression/blatstocyst development on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. One study89 measured testicular aging across seven measures and saw a consistent\nstatistically significant effect in each one. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.65–1.00) (n = 7/7). For the risk of bias, this study was rated high or\nprobably high\nfor three domains (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, this study tested polystyrene microplastics. We concluded\nthat exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor testicular aging on the basis of (a) the “very low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study87 measured anogenital index and distance in two\nsets of pups, postnatal day 35 and 70, and found no significant difference\nbetween the least and most exposed groups for either end point or\npostnatal day. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.50 (95%\nCI of 0.15–0.85) (n = 2/4). For the\nrisk of bias, this study was rated probably high for one\ndomain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polystyrene. We\nconcluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor anogenital index and distance on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for\nstudies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited\nconfidence in the association considering factors including the number\nand size of studies. Five studies evaluated the effects of\nmicroplastic exposure on sperm and sperm-related outcomes.74,84−87 For the risk of bias, one study was rated high or probably\nhigh for four and three domains (different apical outcomes and/or\nresults with different ROB ratings),85 one\nstudy was rated high or probably high for three domains,86 one study was rated high or probably high for\nthree and two domains (different apical outcomes and/or results with\ndifferent ROB ratings),74 one study was\nrated high or probably high for two domains and one domain (different\napical outcomes and/or results with different ROB ratings),84 and one study was rated probably high for only\none domain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, all five studies tested polystyrene.74,84−87 Studies found trends in declines in living sperm, sperm concentrations,\nand sperm motility as well as increases in sperm malformation (also\nreported as sperm deformity or sperm abnormality). Outcome assessors\nwere blinded during sperm malformations and viability assessments\nin only one study.84 All studies reported\npositive associations between increasing microplastic exposure and\ndecreases in measures of sperm quality and/or quantity. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00) (n = 9/9). See Supporting Information File 8 and Figure S4. We did not conduct a sensitivity\nanalysis as all studies were in the direction of showing harm. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact sperm quality and testicular health in humans\non the basis of (a) the “high” quality of the body of\nevidence (Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”), (b) the direction\nof the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse health effect\nwith an increasing level of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence\nin the association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. See Supporting Information File 7 (“Evidence ratings for studies”) for a detailed rationale\nfor these ratings. One study84 evaluated the effects of microplastic exposure on germinal\ncell thickness and found a significant decrease and dose–response\neffects between control and exposure groups.84 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00)\n(n = 1/1). This study was rated high or probably\nhigh for two domains. This study tested polystyrene. We\nconcluded that exposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor germinal thickness on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. Two studies evaluated\nthe effects of microplastic exposure on ovarian follicles.72,73 For the risk of bias, both studies were rated high or probably\nhigh for three domains72,73 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, both studies tested polystyrene.72,73 Both studies found a significant decrease in the number of\ngrowing\nfollicles for the most exposed group and a consistent dose–response\nrelationship. For both studies, five random visual fields were used\nto assess the number of growing follicles via microscope imaging for\neach rat model (six from each group). It is unclear whether five images\nwere sufficient to qualitatively assess the measurement, but the authors\ndo refer to previous literature for their methodology. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00) (n = 2/2). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S5. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis as both\nstudies tested polystyrene and each study contributed only one study\nresult for the outcome. We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “suspected”\nto adversely impact ovarian follicle development in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence,\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Six studies measured alterations\nof reproductive hormones.72,73,82−84,87 For the risk\nof bias, two studies were rated high or probably high for four domains,82,83 two studies were rated high or probably high for two domains,72,73 and two studies were rated high or probably high for one domain84,87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, five studies\ntested polystyrene72,73,83,84,87 and one study\ntested polyethylene.82 Two studies\nfound significant changes in anti-Müllerian\nhormone (AMH) concentration: one in serum73 and the other in ovaries.72 One study\nfound significant changes in Inhibin in pups postnatal day 35 and\n70.87 Four studies measured luteinizing\nhormone (LH),82−84,87 but only one found\nsignificant decreases in the level of serum LH.84 Two studies found no significant changes in progesterone.82,83 Three of four studies found significant changes in follicle-stimulating\nhormone (FSH).83,84,87 Three studies found significant changes in testosterone concentrations.83,84,87 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.77 (95% CI of 0.57–0.90) (n = 17/22). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S6. We conducted a sensitivity analysis and\n(1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.78 (95% CI of 0.55–0.91) (n =\n14/18) versus polyethylene microplastics = 0.75 (95% CI of 0.30–95)\n(n = 3/4) (difference between proportions p = 0.90) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 0.83 (95% CI of 0.44–0.97) (n = 5/6) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.77 (95% CI of 0.57–0.90) (n = 17/22) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.75) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and polyethylene results or when only one result per study\nwas considered versus our primary analysis of including all study\nresults from each study. We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “suspected”\nto adversely impact reproductive hormones in humans on the basis of\n(a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence,\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality\nof the evidence for these outcomes\nas “moderate”. See Supporting Information File 8 (“Evidence ratings for studies”) for a\ndetailed rationale for these ratings. Across the\noutcomes that were fully evaluated, we identified that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected” to be a hazard to the human\nreproductive system.\n\n## Apical Outcomes\nOne study88 evaluated birth outcomes by measuring the weight of the\nfetus and placenta. They found a statistically significant decrease\nin the weight of the fetus between the most and least exposed groups,\nbut not for the weight of the placenta. See Supporting\nInformation File 4 (“Study Results”). The\nestimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful\n= 0.50 (95% CI of 0.09–0.91) (n = 1/2). For the risk of bias, this study was rated probably high for two\ndomains (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type,\nthis study tested polystyrene. We concluded that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor birth outcomes of the weight of the fetus and placenta on the\nbasis of (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. Two studies82,86 evaluated\nthe birth outcome of litter size. One study found a statistically\nsignificant difference in the number of offspring between the most\nand least exposed groups.82 One study found\nno difference in litter size or post-survival rate.86 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.33 (95% CI of 0.06–0.79)\n(n = 1/3). For the risk of bias, both studies\nwere rated high or probably\nhigh for three domains82,86 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, one study tested polystyrene87 and polyethylene.82 We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “not\nclassifiable”\nfor the birth outcome of litter size on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for\nstudies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited\nconfidence in the association considering factors including the number\nand size of studies. One study87 evaluated age at puberty and found a statistically significant decrease\nin onset between the most and least exposed groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00)\n(n = 1/1). For the risk of bias, this study\nwas rated probably high for one\ndomain87 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polystyrene.87 We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “not classifiable”\nfor the onset of puberty on the basis of (a) the “low”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect, and (c) the limited confidence in\nthe association considering factors including the number and size\nof studies. One study82 evaluated oocyte meiotic progression/blatstocyst\ndevelopment and found a statistically significant percentage decrease\nin both outcomes between the least and most exposed groups. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.34–1.00)\n(n = 2/2). For the risk of bias, this study\nwas rated high or probably high\nfor three domains82 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, this study tested polyethylene.82 We concluded that exposure to microplastics\nis “not classifiable”\nfor effect meiotic progression/blatstocyst development on the basis\nof (a) the “low” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect, and\n(c) the limited confidence in the association considering factors\nincluding the number and size of studies. One study89 measured testicular aging across seven measures and saw a consistent\nstatistically significant effect in each one. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.65–1.00) (n = 7/7). For the risk of bias, this study was rated high or\nprobably high\nfor three domains (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, this study tested polystyrene microplastics.

The estimate of the proportion of effects showing microplastics\nare harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1). For the risk of bias, this study was rated high for\nconfounding\nand probably high for study group selection and exposure assessment\n(see Supporting Information File 5, “Risk\nof bias heat map”, and Supporting Information File 6 for justification of ratings). We concluded that\nexposure to microplastics is “not classifiable”\nfor chronic rhinosinusitis in humans on the basis of (a) the “very\nlow” quality of the body of evidence, (b) the direction of\nthe effect, and (c) the limited confidence in the association considering\nfactors including the number and size of studies. We evaluated five outcomes across seven\nstudies related to the respiratory system. Four studies92−95 evaluated total cell count (total cells, macrophages, lymphocytes,\nneutrophils, and polymorphonuclear cells). Three studies measured92,93,95 pulmonary function (pressure–volume\nloops, peak expiratory flows, tissue dampening, tissue elastance,\ncentral airway resistance, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory\nvolume, tidal volume, minute volume, inspiratory time, expiratory\ntime, peak inspiratory flow, and peak expiratory flow). Four studies93−96 evaluated lung injury (lung tissue score, pulmonary parenchymal\narea, average vessel thickness, and number of alveolar septa). Three studies evaluated biomarkers related to chronic inflammation\n(IL-6 secretions, TNF-α secretions, IL-8 secretions, IL-1β\nsecretions, TGF-β). Three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers for lung fibrosis (vimentin,\nα-SMA, surfactant protein-C, MCP-1, and Krebs von den lungen-6\n& KC) resulting from inflammation, and three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers related\nto oxidative stress (ROS, SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT). Similar measurements\nwere conducted between studies; however, not\nall measurements were the same, and estimates could not be combined\nin a meta-analysis or visually displayed collectively in a figure\nbecause estimates were reported on different scales, used different\nassociation metrics, or were not fully reported. Three studies92,93,95 evaluated pulmonary function (pressure–volume\nloops, peak expiratory flows, tissue dampening, tissue elastance,\ncentral airway resistance, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory\nvolume, tidal volume, minute volume, inspiratory time, expiratory\ntime, peak inspiratory flow, and peak expiratory flow) and found decreased\nforced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1). See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study Results”). The estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful = 0.83 (95% CI of 0.63–0.93)\n(n = 19/23). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S7. For the risk of bias, three studies\nwere rated high/probably high\nfor two domains92,9395 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, two studies\ntested polystyrene92,93,95 and one tested tire wear microplastic\nparticles.93 We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.73 (95% CI of 0.48–0.89) (n =\n11/15) versus tire wear microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.68–1.00)\n(n = 8/8) (difference between proportions p = 0.11) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n = 3/3) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.83 (95% CI of 0.63–0.93) (n = 19/23) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.43) (Supporting Information File 7). We found polystyrene\nmicroplastics had a lower estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing harm versus tire wear microplastics;\nhowever, the difference was not statistically significant. We found\nwhen only one result per study was considered, the estimate of the\nproportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful was greater\nversus our primary analysis of including all study results from each\nstudy; however, the difference was not statistically significant. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact pulmonary function in humans on the basis of (a)\nthe “moderate” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”, for a detailed rationale for these ratings),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Four studies93−96 evaluated lung injury (lung tissue\nscore, pulmonary parenchymal area, average vessel thickness, number\nof alveolar septa, and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia) and found\nconsistent effects indicating damage and fibrosis to the lung tissue.\nThese findings are consistent with lung tissue damage. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 0.88 (95% CI of 0.53–0.98)\n(n = 7/8). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S8. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 for three domains,93 and two were rated high/probably high for two\ndomains95,96 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, two studies tested polystyrene,95,96 one tested\npolypropylene,94 and one tested\ntire wear microplastic particles93 We conducted a sensitivity analysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n =\n3/3) versus polypropylene = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1) and versus tire wear microplastics = 1.00 (95%\nCI of 0.51–1.00) (n = 4/4) and (2) measured\nthe proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful when only\none result per study was considered = 0.75 (95% CI of 0.30–0.95)\n(n = 3/4) versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study = 0.88 (95% CI of 0.53–0.98)\n(n = 7/8) (difference between proportions p = 0.57) (Supporting Information File 7). We found no difference in the estimate of the proportion\nof effects\nshowing harm between polystyrene versus polyethylene microplastics\nand between polystyrene versus tire ware microplastics. We found when\nonly one result per study was considered, the estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful was lower versus our\nprimary analysis of including all study results from each study; however,\nthe difference was not statistically significant. We concluded\nthat exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto cause lung injury on the basis of (a) the “moderate”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. Four studies92−95 evaluated total cell counts (total\ncells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and polymorphonuclear\ncells). For the risk of bias, one study was rated high/probably\nhigh across four domains,94 one was rated\nhigh/probably high for two domains,95 two\nwere rated high/probably high for one domain92 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, two studies tested polystyrene,92,95 one tested polypropylene,94 and one tested\ntire wear microplastic particles.93 Two\nstudies found a decrease in the number of macrophages that were statistically\nsignificant.93,95 Three studies found an increase\nin the total number of cells and lymphocytes.93−95 Two studies\nfound a statistically significant increase in the number of neutrophils.94,95 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.74 (95% CI of 0.54–0.87) (n = 17/23). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure on\ntotal cell counts are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “very low” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Five studies92,94,95,98,99 evaluated biomarkers related to chronic inflammation\n(IL-6 secretions, TNF-α secretions, IL-8 secretions, IL-1β\nsecretions and TGF-β) and resultant lung fibrosis (vimentin,\nα-SMA, surfactant protein-C, Krebs von den lungen-6, and MCP-1)\nand found increased levels of measured biomarkers in mice exposed\nto microplastics consistent with inflammation and lung fibrosis. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 0.96 (95% CI of 0.82–0.99)\n(n = 27/28). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S9. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 one study was rated high/probably\nhigh in three domains,97 and three studies\nwere rated high/probably high for two domains92,95,98 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, four studies tested polystyrene92,95,98,97 and one tested polypropylene94 microplastics. We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.96 (95% CI of 0.79–0.99) (n =\n22/23) versus polypropylene microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.57–1.00)\n(n = 5/5) (difference between proportions p = 0.64) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.57–1.00) (n = 5/5) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.96 (95% CI of 0.82–0.99) (n = 27/28) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.64) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polypropylene results or when only one result\nper study was considered versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study. We concluded that exposure\nto microplastics is “suspected”\nto induce chronic inflammation and lung fibrosis in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers related to oxidative\nstress (ROS, SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT) and found that the decrease in\nthe levels of SOD, GSH/PX, and CAT and the increase in the level of\nROS are consistent with oxidative stress in the lung. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9).

For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 one study was rated high/probably\nhigh in three domains,97 and one study\nwas rated high/probably high for two domains95 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\nas every result was in the direction of showing harm. For the\nmicroplastic type, two studies tested polystyrene95,97 and one tested polypropylene94 microplastics. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto induce oxidative stress on the basis of (a) the “moderate”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality\nof the evidence for these outcomes\nas “moderate” quality.

We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto adversely impact pulmonary function in humans on the basis of (a)\nthe “moderate” quality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”, for a detailed rationale for these ratings),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies.\n\n## Lung Injury\nFour studies93−96 evaluated lung injury (lung tissue\nscore, pulmonary parenchymal area, average vessel thickness, number\nof alveolar septa, and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia) and found\nconsistent effects indicating damage and fibrosis to the lung tissue.\nThese findings are consistent with lung tissue damage. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 0.88 (95% CI of 0.53–0.98)\n(n = 7/8). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S8. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 for three domains,93 and two were rated high/probably high for two\ndomains95,96 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, two studies tested polystyrene,95,96 one tested\npolypropylene,94 and one tested\ntire wear microplastic particles93 We conducted a sensitivity analysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.44–1.00) (n =\n3/3) versus polypropylene = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.21–1.00) (n = 1/1) and versus tire wear microplastics = 1.00 (95%\nCI of 0.51–1.00) (n = 4/4) and (2) measured\nthe proportion of effects showing microplastics are harmful when only\none result per study was considered = 0.75 (95% CI of 0.30–0.95)\n(n = 3/4) versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study = 0.88 (95% CI of 0.53–0.98)\n(n = 7/8) (difference between proportions p = 0.57) (Supporting Information File 7). We found no difference in the estimate of the proportion\nof effects\nshowing harm between polystyrene versus polyethylene microplastics\nand between polystyrene versus tire ware microplastics. We found when\nonly one result per study was considered, the estimate of the proportion\nof effects showing microplastics are harmful was lower versus our\nprimary analysis of including all study results from each study; however,\nthe difference was not statistically significant. We concluded\nthat exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto cause lung injury on the basis of (a) the “moderate”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies.\n\n## Total Cell Counts\nFour studies92−95 evaluated total cell counts (total\ncells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and polymorphonuclear\ncells). For the risk of bias, one study was rated high/probably\nhigh across four domains,94 one was rated\nhigh/probably high for two domains,95 two\nwere rated high/probably high for one domain92 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic type, two studies tested polystyrene,92,95 one tested polypropylene,94 and one tested\ntire wear microplastic particles.93 Two\nstudies found a decrease in the number of macrophages that were statistically\nsignificant.93,95 Three studies found an increase\nin the total number of cells and lymphocytes.93−95 Two studies\nfound a statistically significant increase in the number of neutrophils.94,95 See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics\nare harmful = 0.74 (95% CI of 0.54–0.87) (n = 17/23). We concluded that impacts of microplastics exposure on\ntotal cell counts are “not classifiable” on the basis\nof (a) the “very low” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies.\n\n## Biological Changes (key characteristics)\nFive studies92,94,95,98,99 evaluated biomarkers related to chronic inflammation\n(IL-6 secretions, TNF-α secretions, IL-8 secretions, IL-1β\nsecretions and TGF-β) and resultant lung fibrosis (vimentin,\nα-SMA, surfactant protein-C, Krebs von den lungen-6, and MCP-1)\nand found increased levels of measured biomarkers in mice exposed\nto microplastics consistent with inflammation and lung fibrosis. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 0.96 (95% CI of 0.82–0.99)\n(n = 27/28). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S9. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 one study was rated high/probably\nhigh in three domains,97 and three studies\nwere rated high/probably high for two domains92,95,98 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). For the microplastic\ntype, four studies tested polystyrene92,95,98,97 and one tested polypropylene94 microplastics. We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis and (1) compared the estimate\nof the proportion of effects showing polystyrene microplastics are\nharmful = 0.96 (95% CI of 0.79–0.99) (n =\n22/23) versus polypropylene microplastics = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.57–1.00)\n(n = 5/5) (difference between proportions p = 0.64) and (2) measured the proportion of effects showing\nmicroplastics are harmful when only one result per study was considered\n= 1.00 (95% CI of 0.57–1.00) (n = 5/5) versus\nour primary analysis of including all study results from each study\n= 0.96 (95% CI of 0.82–0.99) (n = 27/28) (difference\nbetween proportions p = 0.64) (Supporting Information File 7). We found that you could\nnot reasonably distinguish between the\npolystyrene and the polypropylene results or when only one result\nper study was considered versus our primary analysis of including\nall study results from each study. We concluded that exposure\nto microplastics is “suspected”\nto induce chronic inflammation and lung fibrosis in humans on the\nbasis of (a) the “moderate” quality of the body of evidence\n(see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence\nratings for studies”), (b) the direction of the effect (i.e.,\nevidence of an increasing adverse health effect with an increasing\nlevel of microplastic exposure), and (c) the confidence in the association\nconsidering factors including the number and size of studies. Three studies94,95,97 evaluated biomarkers related to oxidative\nstress (ROS, SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT) and found that the decrease in\nthe levels of SOD, GSH/PX, and CAT and the increase in the level of\nROS are consistent with oxidative stress in the lung. See Supporting Information File 4 (“Study\nResults”). The estimate of the proportion of effects\nshowing microplastics are harmful = 1.00 (95% CI of 0.70–1.00)\n(n = 9/9). See Supporting Information File 9 and Figure S10. For the risk of bias, one study\nwas rated high/probably high across\nfour domains,94 one study was rated high/probably\nhigh in three domains,97 and one study\nwas rated high/probably high for two domains95 (see Supporting Information Files 5 and 6). We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis\nas every result was in the direction of showing harm. For the\nmicroplastic type, two studies tested polystyrene95,97 and one tested polypropylene94 microplastics. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is “suspected”\nto induce oxidative stress on the basis of (a) the “moderate”\nquality of the body of evidence (see Supporting Information File 8, “Evidence ratings for studies”),\n(b) the direction of the effect (i.e., evidence of an increasing adverse\nhealth effect with an increasing level of microplastic exposure),\nand (c) the confidence in the association considering factors including\nthe number and size of studies. We considered the overall quality\nof the evidence for these outcomes\nas “moderate” quality. See Supporting Information File 7 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor a detailed rationale for these ratings. Across the\noutcomes that were fully evaluated, we identified that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected” to be a hazard to the human\nrespiratory system.\n\n## Chronic Inflammation\nFive studies92,94,95,98,99 evaluated biomarkers related to chronic inflammation\n(IL-6 secretions, TNF-α secretions, IL-8 secretions, IL-1β\nsecretions and TGF-β) and resultant lung fibrosis (vimentin,\nα-SMA, surfactant protein-C, Krebs von den lungen-6, and MCP-1)\nand found increased levels of measured biomarkers in mice exposed\nto microplastics consistent with inflammation and lung fibrosis.

We considered the overall quality\nof the evidence for these outcomes\nas “moderate” quality. See Supporting Information File 7 (“Evidence ratings for studies”)\nfor a detailed rationale for these ratings.\n\n## Conclusion about the Respiratory Studies\nAcross the\noutcomes that were fully evaluated, we identified that exposure to\nmicroplastics is “suspected” to be a hazard to the human\nrespiratory system.\n\n## Discussion\nWe have identified suspected human health\nrisks from microplastic\nexposure in three body systems (digestive, reproductive, and respiratory).\nFor reproductive outcomes (sperm quality) and digestive outcomes (immunosuppression)\nwe rated the overall body of evidence as “high” quality\nand concluded microplastic exposure is “suspected” to\nadversely impact them based on consistent evidence of adverse health\neffects and confidence in the association. We downgraded the evidence\nfrom “presumed” based on the sample size and number\nof studies. For reproductive outcomes (female follicles and reproductive\nhormones), digestive outcomes (gross or microanatomic colon/small\nintestine effects, alters cell proliferation and cell death, and chronic\ninflammation), and respiratory outcomes (pulmonary function, lung\ninjury, chronic inflammation, and oxidative stress) we rated the overall\nbody of evidence as “moderate” quality and concluded\nmicroplastic exposure is “suspected” to adversely impact\nthem based on consistent evidence of adverse health effects and confidence\nin the association. We concluded that exposure to microplastics is\n“unclassifiable” for birth outcomes and gestational\nage in humans based on the “low” and “very low”\nquality of the evidence. Given the ubiquity of microplastics\nand the consistent, growing\nrecognition of their existence in the human body, it is likely that\nmicroplastics will impact other body systems, which is a potential\narea for future research.100 This is a\nparticularly timely given that plastic production is projected to\ntriple by 2060.2 These findings have\nimportant implications for policy and research.\nFirst, given the indication of harm that we have identified, the need\nfor additional research on the health effects of microplastics should\nnot preclude action. We strongly recommend that regulatory agencies\nand decision makers can act on limited evidence given that evidence\nhas been shown to grow and get stronger101 and initiate actions to prevent or mitigate human exposure to microplastics.\nSecond, there is opportunity under the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency’s Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to consider microplastics\nas a class or category of chemicals102 in\nits risk evaluations, which is a key component of identifying health\nrisks for risk management actions. The U.S. Congress gave the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to jointly evaluate\nany “category of chemical substances”,103 defined as “a group of chemical substances the members\nof which are similar in molecular structure, in physical, chemical,\nor biological properties, in use, or in mode of entrance into the\nhuman body or into the environment, or the members of which are in\nsome other way suitable for classification.”104 Microplastics would meet this definition. Additionally,\nEPA could conduct a cumulative risk assessment based on their draft\napproach.105 The strengths of this\nwork include the use of established rapid\nsystematic review (rapid review) methods to accelerate the process\nof performing a full systematic review.38,39 Our rapid\nreview was guided by the Navigation Guide systematic review method,40 which has been implemented to evaluate the health\neffects of multiple chemical exposures41−43,106 and used by the World Health Organization and International Labor\nOrganization Joint Estimates of the Work-related Burden of Disease\nand Injury.44 These methods represent a\ntransparent, rigorous, and unbiased approach to gathering the available\nevidence, evaluating it, and developing actionable statements for\ndecision makers. We applied the key characteristics approach,51,53,56 an approach that is in alignment\nwith the\nState of California’s current efforts to advance methods using\nbiological and mechanistic data to understand human health harms from\nexposure to chemicals.107 For the digestive\nand respiratory outcomes, we utilized the key characteristics of carcinogens.\nFor reproductive health outcomes, we utilized the key characteristics\nof reproductive toxicity.51,56 We used the concept\nof key characteristics to identify mechanisms indicative of cancer\nor reproductive toxicity.51,53,56,81 Using this approach, the greater\nthe number of key characteristics identified, the more likely the\nexposure (microplastics) was linked to these adverse health outcomes.\nWe prioritized the evidence most useful for understanding the impacts\nof microplastic exposure on human health and reported significant\nfindings on the basis of statistical relevance. We conducted a sensitivity\nanalysis to test the robustness of our results when including only\none type of microplastic and only one study result per outcome in\nthe synthesis. We extrapolated microplastic exposure concentrations\nin rodent\nstudies to the predicted exposure concentrations in humans. We converted\nall microplastic concentrations (which were reported in a variety\nof ways, including micrograms per liter, micrograms, milligrams per\nkilogram, micrograms per gram, and milligrams per day) to particles\nper liter for water or particles per gram for food. Assuming an approximate\ndaily consumption rate of 5 mL of water and 5 g of food for each rodent,\na daily microplastic consumption rate was estimated unless specified\notherwise.108 To convert the units from\nmass to particles, we assumed a spherical shape and density of each\nplastic polymer under standard conditions (1.05 g/cm3 for\npolystyrene and 0.96 g/cm3 for polyethylene).109 For microplastic sizes between 5 and\n150 μm, the range of\ndaily microplastic intake for exposed rodent experiments is approximately\n7–70 000 microplastic particles, which is in range with\nthe estimated daily microplastic intake for humans (∼422 particles\nper day).110 For smaller microplastic sizes\nsuch as 0.05–0.5 μm, the range of daily exposure concentrations\nwas approximately 7 × 106 to 8.02 × 1011, which could be higher than estimated human exposure concentrations\nbut can still be informative for human health effects. There\nwere both methodological limitations and evidence base limitations\nof this review. Although the methods we employed were extremely rigorous,\nwe recognize the possibility for increased human error, particularly\nin our screening and risk of bias assessment methods in which one\nperson was screened/evaluated and another verified, which would be\nconducted in duplicate in a full systematic review. We also did not\nevaluate all outcomes reported in the included studies, nor did we\nconsider all body systems that may be impacted by microplastic exposure.\nWe further recognize that we were addressing only rodent studies and\nthat the inclusion of other species (such as zebrafish) would make\nour findings more robust. Additionally, the use of p values to identify if there was a significant harmful difference\nbetween the control and most exposed group is likely to underestimate\nthe number of outcomes where microplastic exposure leads to changes\nbetween these groups.62 However, we avoided\nplacing increased weight on statistical significance, which does not\naddress biological significance or the magnitude of the effect observed. Despite the growing body of evidence linking microplastics to adverse\nhealth outcomes, limitations in the evidence base remain. The studies\nin our rapid review are limited to primary microplastics of only three\npolymer types (polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene) and one\nsource of secondary microplastics (tire wear particles). The shape\nand size of microplastics evaluated in the included studies were also\nvery homogeneous (generally spherically shaped). The variety of microplastics\nin terms of polymer types, sizes, and shapes is much greater and may\ndifferentially impact health but has not been studied in chronic rodent\nsystems.111 We also could not account for\nadditives in the plastics or the effects of microplastics degraded\nfrom sources like fabrics given the lack of studies on these topics.\nWe could also not consider aggregate or cumulative exposures to microplastics\nand other environmental contaminants. We also did not consider the\nbiological contaminants that may attach to microplastics,112 which may impact how other environmental chemicals\nor other biological contaminants enter the human body. Our study was\nalso limited by the study population; only one study each evaluated\nsensitive life stages (e.g., child development), exacerbation by other\nstressors (e.g., poverty and food scarcity), or disease or genetic\nstatus (e.g., only healthy homogeneous rodents evaluated). Thus, we\ncould not evaluate cumulative impacts of microplastic exposure. There is a potential for publication biases. It is possible that\nstudies showing null effects of microplastic exposure were either\nnot accepted or submitted for publication or that other important\nend points in the included studies were either not measured or not\nreported. We additionally found limited human studies, which could\nreflect a lack of appropriate resource allocation to address the challenges\nof conducting epidemiological studies, or that this is a nascent area\nof research and that the follow-up time required to show the relationship\nbetween microplastics and human health effects has not been sufficient\nfor these studies to be published. As this was a rapid review, we\ndid not contact the authors for missing data. Given these limitations,\nit is likely our conclusions underestimate\nthe true health impacts of microplastic exposure. Importantly, these\nlimitations highlight that there are clear opportunities for future\nresearch, including (1) epidemiological studies and standardizing\nanalytical methods investigating the health impacts of microplastic\nexposure, (2) other health outcomes impacted by microplastic exposure,\nand (3) evaluating the impact of microplastic exposure for susceptible\nhuman populations due to their developmental stage or other socioenvironmental\nstressors. Finally, research should focus on identifying, and then\nevaluating, strategies for mitigating or preventing exposures to microplastics.\n\n## Conclusion\nMicroplastics are “suspected”\nto harm human reproduction\nand digestive and respiratory health, with a suggested link to colon\ncancer. Future research on microplastics should investigate additional\nhealth outcomes impacted by microplastic exposure and identify strategies\nto reduce exposure. Governments at all levels of jurisdiction (federal,\nstate, and local) should take immediate action to mitigate exposure\nfrom microplastics.",
