  "abstract": "Occupational\nexposures to flame retardants (FRs), a class of suspected\nendocrine-disrupting compounds, are of health concern for firefighters.\nWe sought to characterize exposure to FR compounds and evaluate their\nassociation with thyroid hormone levels, a biomarker of early effect,\nin female firefighters and office workers in San Francisco. In a cross-sectional\nstudy, we measured replacement organophosphate and organohalogen FRs\nin spot urine samples from firefighters (N = 86)\nand office workers (N = 84), as well as total thyroxine\n(T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone in plasma for 84 firefighters\nand 81 office workers. Median bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate\n(BDCPP) levels were 5 times higher in firefighters than office workers.\nAmong firefighters, a doubling of BDCPP was associated with a 2.88%\ndecrease (95% confidence interval −5.28, −0.42) in T4. We did not observe significant associations between FRs\nand T4 among office workers. In the full group, intermediate\nbody mass index and a college education were associated with higher\nFR levels. The inverse association observed between FRs and T4 coupled with the lack of studies on women workers and evidence\nof adverse health effects from FR exposure—including endocrine\ndisruption and breast cancer risk—warrant further research\non occupational exposures and identification of opportunities for\nexposure reduction.",

      "text": "Occupational\nexposures in firefighting have been well-documented\namong male firefighters yet understudied among women. Common exposures\ninclude polyaromatic hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, benzene, dioxins,\ndiesel, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and flame retardants\n(FRs) including organohalogen FRs, such as polybrominated diphenyl\nethers (PBDEs), and organophosphate FRs (OPFRs).1−11 While exposure sources among men and women in firefighting are expected\nto be similar, there may be differences in metabolism or susceptibility\nfor certain chemicals that could alter the health risks of exposure.\nA recent paper on PFAS exposure among women firefighters of the Women\nWorkers Biomonitoring Collaborative (WWBC) study found that women\nfirefighters had elevated levels of some PFAS chemicals compared to\nwomen office workers but lower levels than previous studies on male\nfirefighters.11 FRs are of particular\ninterest for firefighters because they have\nbeen found in firefighting gear12 and in\nfire station dust.9,10 Additionally, firefighter biomonitoring\nand studies of fire station dust samples have found elevated levels\nof brominated and organohalogen FRs compared to homes and offices\nincluding the organophosphate tris(1,3-dichloro-isopropyl)-phosphate\n(TDCPP).7,9,10 Exposure\nto FRs is common in the general population despite the\nphase out of mandatory FR use in furniture in 2013. California’s\nfurniture flammability standard required furniture filling such as\npolyurethane foam to withstand an open flame test without igniting,\nwhich led to widespread use of FRs in furniture-filling materials\nsold across the country.13−15 Because FRs are often added to\nproducts post-production and are not chemically bound to fabric and\nfoams, they can leach out of materials and contaminate air and dust.13,16 Concerns about toxicity, bioaccumulation, and long half-life of\nPBDEs led to an increase in the use of replacement FRs in the early\n2000s, including OPFRs, in furniture, fabrics, and electronics.17 In addition to polyurethane foam, OPFRs are\ncommonly used in fabric, electronics, and engine lubricants and as\nplasticizers.17−19 Due to OPFR use in fabrics and the detection of PBDEs\nin firefighter gear,12 OPFRs are likely\nused in firefighter clothing and protective gear. The half-lives of\nOPFRs and tetrabromobisphenol A are not well-known, although they\nare generally considered to be shorter than those of PBDEs—potentially\non the order of hours or days.20,21 While direct strong\nevidence is still lacking in human studies, exposure to OPFRs has\nbeen associated with endocrine disruption relevant to breast cancer22,23 as well as breast tumor development in animal studies and limited\nhuman studies.22,24,25 This paper focuses on thyroid hormone disruption as a biomarker\nof early effect of potential relevance for breast cancer and other\nadverse health outcomes. Prior studies have found that women firefighters\nhave a higher incidence of and mortality from breast cancer than the\ngeneral (nonfirefighter) population.26−28 Additionally, thyroid\ndysfunction is associated with increased cancer risk, including breast\ncancer, in epidemiology studies.29−31 Methodological challenges\nfrom the low numbers of women in the fire service and in most fire\ndepartments, as well as the long latency period between exposure and\nonset of disease, make it difficult to assess cancer risk of firefighting\namong women. However, understanding women firefighters’ exposure\nto chemicals linked to cancer and biomarkers of effect, such as thyroid\nhormone disruption, can inform timely prevention efforts. In addition\nto concerns about cancer, organophosphate and brominated FRs have\nalso been associated with altered thyroid hormone levels both in vitro and in vivo (Table S1).32−36 Circulating thyroid-stimulating\nhormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone, including thyroxine (T4), may be altered by exposure to environmental chemicals including\nOPFRs,23,25,34,37 and thyroid hormones may be relevant to diverse downstream\nadverse health impacts such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.23,38,39 Thyroid hormones have multiple\nforms and include total T4, free T4, and triiodothyronine\n(T3) in both the free and bound forms. Total T4 is the sum of bound and free T4 and is important for\nmaintaining homeostasis and for transporting thyroid hormones to target\ntissues. Alterations to total T4 may also be an indicator\nof biological perturbations.37 Studies\nof zebrafish and chicken embryos show that OPFRs can disrupt thyroid\nhormone homeostasis and decrease thyroid hormone levels.35,40 Human studies suggest that exposure to OPFRs can influence thyroid\nhormone levels, measured by total and free T4, although\nresearch remains limited and the direction of the association is mixed.33,41,42 While biomonitoring studies\nshow that firefighters have higher\nbody burdens of FR chemicals than the general United States population,7,12,43 very little research has investigated\nthe extent and health implications of exposure among women firefighters\ndue to the limited number of women in most fire departments. Assessing\nthyroid hormone disruption associated with FR exposures enables identification\nof early biological perturbations of potential relevance to thyroid\ndysfunction or disease44 and long-term\nadverse health outcomes such as cancer.39 The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) has one of the largest\nurban forces of women firefighters in the U.S.—approximately\n15% of firefighters in the SFFD are women. The WWBC is a community-based\nparticipatory research study with women firefighters from the SFFD.\nOur cross-sectional study sought to characterize exposures to OPFR\nmetabolites and replacement organohalogen FRs (henceforth referred\nto together as FRs) among women firefighters and office workers, identify\npredictors of exposure, and assess the association between FR exposures\nand total T4 and TSH."

      "text": "Study design and participant recruitment protocols have been described\nelsewhere.4,11 Briefly, participant recruitment, interviews,\nand sample collections took place between 2014 and 2015. Participants\nwere employees of the City and County of San Francisco or the SFFD.\nFirefighter collaborators and researchers actively recruited study\nparticipants through the Fire Department, as well as firefighter advocacy\norganizations including the San Francisco Firefighters Cancer Prevention\nFoundation, United Fire Service Women, and the International Association\nof Firefighters Union Local 798. Office workers, who were not first\nresponder employees of the City and County of San Francisco, were\nrecruited by listserv emails, tabling at employee events, and presentations\nby research staff and firefighter collaborators. Potential participants\nwere eligible to enroll if they were 18 years or older and nonsmokers.\nFirefighters were required to have worked in the SFFD for a minimum\nof 5 years and be on “active duty” (i.e., currently assigned to a fire station at the time of recruitment).\nThere was no requirement for duration of employment for the office\nworkers. Participants were consented into the study following protocols\napproved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California,\nBerkeley (# 2013-07-5512). All participants\ncompleted an in-person\nexposure assessment interview. Research staff collected demographic\nand basic health information including body mass index (BMI) and the\nuse of hormone replacement medications (relevant interview questions\ncan be found in the Supporting Information). We also asked about possible sources of FR exposure including\ndiet (types and quantities of different foods and food packaging and\npreparation) and occupational activities (time sitting at a computer\nand office furnishings for office workers, fire suppression activities,\nfirehouse activities, and use of personal protective equipment for\nfirefighters). A subset of participants (N = 66)\ngave researchers permission to access their departmental firefighting\nhistory records, from which we abstracted the number of fires fought\nin the 7 days and month prior to the sample collection date to investigate\nif a recent firefighting activity was associated with FR levels. We\nchose to look at this time frame because the half-lives for OFPRs\nvary and are not well-described.21 A trained phlebotomist collected blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid-treated lavender top tubes. Urine specimens were collected by\nparticipants in 60 mL polypropylene biospecimen cups. Biospecimens\nwere put on ice and transferred to the laboratory at the University\nof California, San Francisco, where research staff processed samples\nwithin 3 h of their collection. Blood collection tubes were spun at\n3000 rpm for 10 min and plasma was aliquoted into 1.1 mL cryovial\ntubes. Urine samples were aliquoted into 3.5 mL cryovial tubes. All\nsamples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. We measured FRs in spot urine samples from\nstudy participants. We selected compounds that would likely be detected\nin urine and are potentially in consumer products such as furniture\nand electronics17 and possibly in firefighter\ngear. We measured the following organophosphate metabolites: bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate\n(BDCPP), bis(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (BCEP), dibutyl phosphate (DBuP),\ndibenzyl phosphate, di-p-cresyl phosphate (DpCP),\nand di-o-cresyl phosphate and 2 brominated compounds:\ntetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and the metabolite 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoic\nacid. Quantification of the eight analytes was performed using\nliquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) on\nan Agilent LC 1260 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,\nCA)—AB Sciex 5500 system (Sciex, Redwood City, CA). To account\nfor urine dilution, we quantified levels of creatinine in participants’\nurine samples (details of the LC–MS/MS method can be found\nin the Supporting Information). To assess potential\nbiological perturbations associated with FR exposures, we measured\nTSH and total T4 in plasma because environmental chemicals\nhave been shown to interact with thyroid hormone transport proteins\nand facilitate metabolism and excretion of the thyroid hormone from\nthe body.45 TSH and total T4 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (antibodies-online,\ncat. no. ABIN2773773) following the manufacturer’s protocol.46 Room-temperature calibrators, controls, and\nsamples (25 μL for T4 and 50 μL for TSH) were\nloaded onto streptavidin-coated wells followed by the addition of\nthe biotinylated antibody for T4 or TSH. Standard curves\nwere constructed in duplicate with calibrators supplied in the kit.\nThe reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed\nthree times. Substrate solution was added and stopped after 15 min.\nAbsorbance at 450 nm was read immediately using a microplate reader.\nThe T4 and TSH concentrations of each sample, run in duplicate,\nwere obtained from the standard curve. According to the manufacturer’s\ninstructions, samples below the limit of detection (LOD) were re-run\nwith a 30 min development time. The goal of this analysis was\ntwofold: first, to characterize exposure to FRs and identify potential\npredictors of exposure among firefighters and office workers, and\nsecond, to assess the relationship between exposure to FRs and T4 and TSH. Because of the evidence for skewed distributions\nfor FRs, T4, and TSH, we used nonparametric approaches\nto test differences between groups (permutation, Wilcoxon) and natural\nlog-transformed creatinine values which improved normality for their\nuse in linear models.47 We used two different\nlinear regression models based on whether FR levels were being evaluated\nas the outcome or exposure and to account for FR levels below the\nLOD. In bivariate analyses looking at the relationship between covariates\n(e.g., food consumption or position in the fire department)\nand FR levels as the outcome, we used the maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE) model from the NADA package in R, which accounts for levels\nbelow the LOD without the need for substitution, when the chemical\nmeasurement is the outcome.48 To assess\nthe relationship between FRs (exposure) and thyroid hormone (outcome),\nwe used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models and operationalized\nlevels below the LOD in the following ways: we included all LC–MS/MS\nreported values (even if those values were below the LOD) and substituted  for any remaining nondetect\nvalues. First, we treated FRs as the outcome to evaluate predictors\nof\nmeasured levels and assess differences between firefighters and office\nworkers. We calculated summary statistics for FRs including the geometric\nmean (GM), geometric standard deviation (GSD), and distribution percentiles\nfor each group. In the full group, we assessed the impact of variables\ncollected from the exposure assessment interview on FR levels as the\noutcome using MLE regression. We limited analyses to FRs with a detection\nfrequency (DF) of 70% or higher in at least one group (firefighters\nor office workers) and applied separate MLE regression models on each\nFR chemical (continuous outcome) controlling for occupation and creatinine.\nWe analyzed the relationship between FR levels and the following variables:\nage, race/ethnicity, BMI, and educational attainment controlling for\noccupation and creatinine. We also assessed the relationship between\nFR exposures and eating certain foods and packaged foods based on\nprior literature suggesting an association with FR exposures.49 We then limited the analysis to firefighters\nto explore specific\noccupational activities that might be associated with FR levels such\nas the participant’s assigned position in the fire department\n(i.e., firefighter, officer, or driver), the frequency\nof using a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) during fire suppression,\nsalvage, and overhaul, and the frequency of showering or washing up\nafter a fire event, if the participant was on duty during the 24 h\nprior to sample collection or had been off duty for more than 24 h.\nWe also assessed the number of fires a participant fought in the week\nand month prior to the sample collection to see if fighting a recent\nfire event was associated with FR levels. We used MLE regression and\nexponentiated the β coefficients and 95% confidence interval\n(CI) to find the proportional change in GM for each unit increase\nor category change versus the referent. Next, we assessed the\nassociation between FRs (exposure) and TSH\nand total T4 (outcome) using OLS regression and substitution\nfor FR values below the LOD. We ran separate models for each FR chemical\nand for the outcomes, TSH and total T4. We considered variables\nto adjust for in our models if they demonstrated a statistically significant\nassociation (p-value < 0.05) with the exposure\n(at least one FR) and the outcome (TSH or T4) in our data\nor if the previous literature identified an association (Figure S1). Although age was not associated with\nFRs in our data, it has been associated with thyroid hormone levels\nin other studies50 and therefore we included\nit as a covariate in regression models. We did not control for BMI\nin regression models because studies indicate that thyroid hormone\ndisruption may be associated with increased BMI,51−53 implying that\nit may be a collider for which adjustment could induce a spurious\nassociation. Since neither race/ethnicity nor education were associated\nwith TSH or T4 in our data (data not shown), we did not\ninclude them in final models. We excluded the participants without\nthyroid hormone measurements or who reported taking thyroid hormone\nreplacement medications. Final models were adjusted for age\nand log(creatinine). Due to\nlarge differences in DFs between firefighters and office workers,\nwe stratified the analysis by occupation. We used continuous FR values\nwhen the DF ≥ 70% and we categorized FR values when DF <\n70%. FRs were categorized into the following groups: <LOD and ≥LOD\n(for FRs with a DF of 25 to 50%) and <LOD, LOD to 50th percentile,\nand >50th percentile (for FRs with DF between 50 and 70%). Compounds\nwith DF below 25% were excluded from the multivariate analysis. Results from the OLS regression models with continuous exposure\nand outcome variables were converted to the percent change in the\noutcome for a twofold increase in FR exposure with the formula: (2β – 1) × 100. From OLS regression models\nwith categorical FR exposure and continuous outcomes, we calculated\nthe percent change in the outcome for each category compared to the\nreferent (<LOD) with the formula: (eβ –\n1) × 100. Analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1\nand R-studio version\n1.2.1335.54,55"

      "text": "To our knowledge, this\nis the first study to measure exposures\nto replacement FRs and their association with thyroid function among\nwomen firefighters compared to office workers. Our results align with\nprior reports that firefighters have higher levels of FRs compared\nto nonfirefighters and contribute further evidence that FRs may affect\nthyroid function in humans. FRs were detected\nin all firefighters and most office workers tested. Women firefighters\nhad higher DFs and higher average levels of FRs compared to women\noffice workers. BDCPP, BCEP, and DBuP were detected more frequently\nand at higher concentrations among firefighters compared to office\nworkers. BDCPP is a metabolite of TDCPP, an FR that is commonly detected\nin household dust and in furniture foam,57 which may help explain why office workers also had a high DF of\nthis compound. The office workers in our study had similar median\nlevels of BDCPP but higher median levels of BCEP and DBuP compared\nto adult women (age 18+) from the 2013–2014 NHANES, which included\nboth workers and nonworkers and is a nationally representative sample\nof the US population.58 Few demographic\nvariables were associated with FRs. Age, for example, was not associated\nwith FRs in our study possibly because of the limited age range of\nour participants (95% of participants were between the ages of 40\nand 55 for firefighters and 32 and 64 for office workers). The positive\nrelationship we observed between OPFR exposures and BMI is consistent\nwith other studies.51 While black participants\nhad higher levels of BDCPP compared to white participants when controlling\nfor age and occupation, this relationship may in fact reflect other\nunknown exposures and be a function of the limited numbers of black\nparticipants in both the firefighter and office worker groups. California’s flammability standard and the changes implemented\nin 2013 may have affected the exposures in our study population. Concerns\nabout the bioaccumulative properties of brominated FRs and the updated\nregulation TB177-2013 led to a shift away from PBDE FRs in furniture.\nIndeed, studies have observed a decrease in PBDEs in people and the\nenvironment, while levels of OPFRs and other replacement FRs are increasing\nin dust and human biomonitoring studies.16,58−60 Additionally, furniture and electronics in homes\nand offices can be a reservoir for both legacy and replacement FRs;\nmany of these products are not frequently replaced and the chemicals\napplied to them are relatively stable, enabling these compounds to\npersist in homes and offices for decades.59 The elevated levels of organophosphate and brominated FRs in furniture,\nhomes, and offices may also be an important exposure source among\nfirefighters as well as the office workers in our study. Similarly,\nFR-containing furniture may add to the toxic burden of fighting fires\nand translate to higher exposures among firefighters when they respond\nto fires. Studies have shown that fighting fires can contaminate firefighter\ngear, trucks, engines, and equipment, bringing chemical exposures\nindoors.10,61−63 Fire station dust\nand fire-fighting gear are also potentially important\nsources of FRs among firefighters. The increased levels of OPFRs found\nin the women firefighters compared to office workers are consistent\nwith other studies measuring elevated levels of OPFRs in fire station\ndust in the U.S. and abroad. Shen et al. (2018) found\nhigher levels of TDCPP, tri-n-butyl phosphate, and\ntris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate, in dust collected in 2015 from fire\nstations across the U.S., compared to levels measured in homes and\nother occupational settings.10 Similarly,\na study of Australian fire station dust found higher median OPFR levels\nin fire stations than from dust samples collected in homes and offices.63 Firefighter gear is also likely to be a source\nof exposure to FRs. A 2016 study of firefighter gear found that some\nnew hoods and gloves had detectable levels of brominated FRs, but\nto our knowledge, studies have not analyzed firefighter gear for OPFRs.\nNevertheless, firefighter gear may contain FR compounds that can contribute\nto exposures from dust accumulated on the gear from fires and calls.12,64,65 A recent study of firefighting\ngear found that fighting fires may contaminate the hoods firefighters\nwear under their protective equipment with OPFRs.62,64,65 Additionally, laundering may have a limited\nimpact on reducing exposures and, in some cases, may cross-contaminate\ngear.62 We were unable to identify\nspecific sources of FRs or why firefighters\nhad higher levels of exposure than office workers. While durable consumer\ngoods such as couches and mattresses may contribute to levels in the\ngeneral population and fire station dust may be an important source\nin firefighters, this does not fully explain where the FR exposures\nare coming from and why the levels are higher in firefighters. Future\nstudies are needed to elucidate potential sources of exposure to legacy\nand replacement FRs which would facilitate the development and promotion\nof effective exposure prevention strategies. Our study contributes\nto the limited literature on thyroid hormone disruption associated\nwith OPFR exposure among women workers. In addition to demonstrating\nendocrine disruption, changes in thyroid hormone levels can also be\na useful biomarker of biological perturbations relevant to downstream\nhealth effects including breast cancer.30,31 Our results\nshowing associations between FRs with decreased T4 were\nprimarily observed among firefighters, particularly for BDCPP, which\nhad the highest DF of the FRs we measured. The broader range and much\nhigher levels of exposure among the firefighters in our study may\nhave allowed us to observe an association between FR exposure on T4 that we could not among office workers who had lower exposure\nlevels. Our findings support evidence of an association between T4 levels and TDCPP, one that has also been identified in studies\nconducted in vitro, in vivo, and\nin limited human studies.33,35,40 In vitro studies provide evidence for the\nmechanistic plausibility of thyroid hormone disruption from OPFR exposure;\nhowever, the mechanism of effect is not yet understood. Hill et al. (2018) tested the effect of organophosphate triesters\non the binding of T4 and transthyretin (TTR)—one\nof the many transport proteins for T4. They found that\nTDCPP and other organophosphate tri- and di-esters increased the binding\naffinity of T4 with TTR. They hypothesized that organophosphate\ncompounds may bind to the surface of TTR, creating a conformational\nchange allowing more T4 binding and increasing the delivery\nof T4 to target cells resulting in lower circulating levels\nof T4 and disrupting T4 homeostasis.32 Our study provides evidence that exposure to\nTDCPP, and to a lesser extent DBuP, is associated with lower thyroid\nhormone levels. Although we observed small changes in total T4 levels, small disruptions to thyroid hormones can have important\nadverse downstream health effects45 even\nwithin normal ranges or subclinical levels.66 Thyroid dysfunction affects up to 5% of the population and is more\nlikely to affect women than men.50 Identifying\nenvironmental chemical exposures that may be associated with biological\nchanges, such as thyroid disruption could be relevant to adverse health\noutcomes such as cardiovascular disease,38 thyroid disease,44 brain development\nof offspring during gestation, and long-term adverse health outcomes\nsuch as cancer.39 This\nwas a cross-sectional study of the\nassociation between FR exposure and measures of thyroid function,\nwhich precludes making inferences regarding causality. Because we\ndid not quantify free T4, T3, or thyroid peroxidase\nantibody, we were not able to assess clinical outcomes in our participants.\nWhile the ratio of free T4 to TSH is useful for clinical\ndiagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, changes in total T4 can provide important insights on early biological perturbations\nthat may be associated with environmental exposures. Thyroid\ndisease and medications—including thyroid hormone replacement\nmedications—may alter thyroid hormone levels. We asked participants\n“Do you take any hormones other than birth control, such as\nPremarin? If so what?” Although some participants disclosed\ntaking thyroid medications or having thyroid problems, the questionnaire\nmay not have accurately captured all the participants with thyroid\ndysfunction or those who take thyroid hormone replacements nor did\nwe ask about other medications that may affect thyroid hormone levels.\nTherefore, we may not have excluded everyone with artificial or abnormal\nthyroid hormone levels due to illness or medication use rather than\nchemical exposure. This could over- or under-estimate thyroid hormone\nlevels depending on the thyroid problem, making it difficult to predict\nin what direction this could affect our results. Another potential\nlimitation is that we used spot urine samples\nwhen measuring FR levels, potentially increasing the variability of\nthe urine concentration and of chemicals measured in our samples.\nStudies describing the stability of OPFRs over time vary;67,68 however, the variability would be nondifferential between firefighters\nand office workers and not likely to affect the differences we observed\nin their chemical levels nor the FR’s relationship with potential\ncovariates. In addition, samples were collected in the morning for\nmost participants, and we measured and adjusted for creatinine to\naccount for urine dilution, reducing some of this variability.47 Finally, there may be residual confounding\nfrom co-exposures that\nwe were not able to measure. Our sample size was modest and may have\nlimited statistical power to detect associations between FR levels\nand exposure sources, as well as associations between FR exposure\nand thyroid hormone disruption, especially at the lower exposure levels\nwe observed in office workers. This is the first study to measure\nFR exposure in a study of women\nfirefighters and office workers. Most participants had detectable\nlevels of at least one OPFR, and both DFs and levels were much higher\namong women firefighters than in women office workers, especially\nfor BDCPP, DBuP, and BCEP. Median levels of the carcinogen metabolite\nBDCPP were 5 times higher in firefighters than for office workers.\nAdditionally, exposure to BDCPP, and to a smaller extent DBuP, was\nassociated with decreased levels of total T4, particularly\namong firefighters. The observed thyroid hormone disruption may indicate\npotential biological perturbations resulting from occupational exposure\nto these compounds. Further research is needed to understand exposure\nsources in occupational settings and fully characterize potential\nhealth impacts of these replacement FRs."

They hypothesized that organophosphate\ncompounds may bind to the surface of TTR, creating a conformational\nchange allowing more T4 binding and increasing the delivery\nof T4 to target cells resulting in lower circulating levels\nof T4 and disrupting T4 homeostasis.32 Our study provides evidence that exposure to\nTDCPP, and to a lesser extent DBuP, is associated with lower thyroid\nhormone levels. Although we observed small changes in total T4 levels, small disruptions to thyroid hormones can have important\nadverse downstream health effects45 even\nwithin normal ranges or subclinical levels.66 Thyroid dysfunction affects up to 5% of the population and is more\nlikely to affect women than men.50 Identifying\nenvironmental chemical exposures that may be associated with biological\nchanges, such as thyroid disruption could be relevant to adverse health\noutcomes such as cardiovascular disease,38 thyroid disease,44 brain development\nof offspring during gestation, and long-term adverse health outcomes\nsuch as cancer.39"

      "text": "This\nwas a cross-sectional study of the\nassociation between FR exposure and measures of thyroid function,\nwhich precludes making inferences regarding causality. Because we\ndid not quantify free T4, T3, or thyroid peroxidase\nantibody, we were not able to assess clinical outcomes in our participants.\nWhile the ratio of free T4 to TSH is useful for clinical\ndiagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, changes in total T4 can provide important insights on early biological perturbations\nthat may be associated with environmental exposures. Thyroid\ndisease and medications—including thyroid hormone replacement\nmedications—may alter thyroid hormone levels. We asked participants\n“Do you take any hormones other than birth control, such as\nPremarin? If so what?” Although some participants disclosed\ntaking thyroid medications or having thyroid problems, the questionnaire\nmay not have accurately captured all the participants with thyroid\ndysfunction or those who take thyroid hormone replacements nor did\nwe ask about other medications that may affect thyroid hormone levels.\nTherefore, we may not have excluded everyone with artificial or abnormal\nthyroid hormone levels due to illness or medication use rather than\nchemical exposure. This could over- or under-estimate thyroid hormone\nlevels depending on the thyroid problem, making it difficult to predict\nin what direction this could affect our results. Another potential\nlimitation is that we used spot urine samples\nwhen measuring FR levels, potentially increasing the variability of\nthe urine concentration and of chemicals measured in our samples.\nStudies describing the stability of OPFRs over time vary;67,68 however, the variability would be nondifferential between firefighters\nand office workers and not likely to affect the differences we observed\nin their chemical levels nor the FR’s relationship with potential\ncovariates. In addition, samples were collected in the morning for\nmost participants, and we measured and adjusted for creatinine to\naccount for urine dilution, reducing some of this variability.47 Finally, there may be residual confounding\nfrom co-exposures that\nwe were not able to measure. Our sample size was modest and may have\nlimited statistical power to detect associations between FR levels\nand exposure sources, as well as associations between FR exposure\nand thyroid hormone disruption, especially at the lower exposure levels\nwe observed in office workers. This is the first study to measure\nFR exposure in a study of women\nfirefighters and office workers. Most participants had detectable\nlevels of at least one OPFR, and both DFs and levels were much higher\namong women firefighters than in women office workers, especially\nfor BDCPP, DBuP, and BCEP. Median levels of the carcinogen metabolite\nBDCPP were 5 times higher in firefighters than for office workers.\nAdditionally, exposure to BDCPP, and to a smaller extent DBuP, was\nassociated with decreased levels of total T4, particularly\namong firefighters. The observed thyroid hormone disruption may indicate\npotential biological perturbations resulting from occupational exposure\nto these compounds. Further research is needed to understand exposure\nsources in occupational settings and fully characterize potential\nhealth impacts of these replacement FRs."

  "full_text": "## Introduction\nOccupational\nexposures in firefighting have been well-documented\namong male firefighters yet understudied among women. Common exposures\ninclude polyaromatic hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, benzene, dioxins,\ndiesel, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and flame retardants\n(FRs) including organohalogen FRs, such as polybrominated diphenyl\nethers (PBDEs), and organophosphate FRs (OPFRs).1−11 While exposure sources among men and women in firefighting are expected\nto be similar, there may be differences in metabolism or susceptibility\nfor certain chemicals that could alter the health risks of exposure.\nA recent paper on PFAS exposure among women firefighters of the Women\nWorkers Biomonitoring Collaborative (WWBC) study found that women\nfirefighters had elevated levels of some PFAS chemicals compared to\nwomen office workers but lower levels than previous studies on male\nfirefighters.11 FRs are of particular\ninterest for firefighters because they have\nbeen found in firefighting gear12 and in\nfire station dust.9,10 Additionally, firefighter biomonitoring\nand studies of fire station dust samples have found elevated levels\nof brominated and organohalogen FRs compared to homes and offices\nincluding the organophosphate tris(1,3-dichloro-isopropyl)-phosphate\n(TDCPP).7,9,10 Exposure\nto FRs is common in the general population despite the\nphase out of mandatory FR use in furniture in 2013. California’s\nfurniture flammability standard required furniture filling such as\npolyurethane foam to withstand an open flame test without igniting,\nwhich led to widespread use of FRs in furniture-filling materials\nsold across the country.13−15 Because FRs are often added to\nproducts post-production and are not chemically bound to fabric and\nfoams, they can leach out of materials and contaminate air and dust.13,16 Concerns about toxicity, bioaccumulation, and long half-life of\nPBDEs led to an increase in the use of replacement FRs in the early\n2000s, including OPFRs, in furniture, fabrics, and electronics.17 In addition to polyurethane foam, OPFRs are\ncommonly used in fabric, electronics, and engine lubricants and as\nplasticizers.17−19 Due to OPFR use in fabrics and the detection of PBDEs\nin firefighter gear,12 OPFRs are likely\nused in firefighter clothing and protective gear. The half-lives of\nOPFRs and tetrabromobisphenol A are not well-known, although they\nare generally considered to be shorter than those of PBDEs—potentially\non the order of hours or days.20,21 While direct strong\nevidence is still lacking in human studies, exposure to OPFRs has\nbeen associated with endocrine disruption relevant to breast cancer22,23 as well as breast tumor development in animal studies and limited\nhuman studies.22,24,25 This paper focuses on thyroid hormone disruption as a biomarker\nof early effect of potential relevance for breast cancer and other\nadverse health outcomes. Prior studies have found that women firefighters\nhave a higher incidence of and mortality from breast cancer than the\ngeneral (nonfirefighter) population.26−28 Additionally, thyroid\ndysfunction is associated with increased cancer risk, including breast\ncancer, in epidemiology studies.29−31 Methodological challenges\nfrom the low numbers of women in the fire service and in most fire\ndepartments, as well as the long latency period between exposure and\nonset of disease, make it difficult to assess cancer risk of firefighting\namong women. However, understanding women firefighters’ exposure\nto chemicals linked to cancer and biomarkers of effect, such as thyroid\nhormone disruption, can inform timely prevention efforts. In addition\nto concerns about cancer, organophosphate and brominated FRs have\nalso been associated with altered thyroid hormone levels both in vitro and in vivo (Table S1).32−36 Circulating thyroid-stimulating\nhormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone, including thyroxine (T4), may be altered by exposure to environmental chemicals including\nOPFRs,23,25,34,37 and thyroid hormones may be relevant to diverse downstream\nadverse health impacts such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.23,38,39 Thyroid hormones have multiple\nforms and include total T4, free T4, and triiodothyronine\n(T3) in both the free and bound forms. Total T4 is the sum of bound and free T4 and is important for\nmaintaining homeostasis and for transporting thyroid hormones to target\ntissues. Alterations to total T4 may also be an indicator\nof biological perturbations.37 Studies\nof zebrafish and chicken embryos show that OPFRs can disrupt thyroid\nhormone homeostasis and decrease thyroid hormone levels.35,40 Human studies suggest that exposure to OPFRs can influence thyroid\nhormone levels, measured by total and free T4, although\nresearch remains limited and the direction of the association is mixed.33,41,42 While biomonitoring studies\nshow that firefighters have higher\nbody burdens of FR chemicals than the general United States population,7,12,43 very little research has investigated\nthe extent and health implications of exposure among women firefighters\ndue to the limited number of women in most fire departments. Assessing\nthyroid hormone disruption associated with FR exposures enables identification\nof early biological perturbations of potential relevance to thyroid\ndysfunction or disease44 and long-term\nadverse health outcomes such as cancer.39 The San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD) has one of the largest\nurban forces of women firefighters in the U.S.—approximately\n15% of firefighters in the SFFD are women. The WWBC is a community-based\nparticipatory research study with women firefighters from the SFFD.\nOur cross-sectional study sought to characterize exposures to OPFR\nmetabolites and replacement organohalogen FRs (henceforth referred\nto together as FRs) among women firefighters and office workers, identify\npredictors of exposure, and assess the association between FR exposures\nand total T4 and TSH.\n\n## Thyroid\nHormone Disruption\nCirculating thyroid-stimulating\nhormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone, including thyroxine (T4), may be altered by exposure to environmental chemicals including\nOPFRs,23,25,34,37 and thyroid hormones may be relevant to diverse downstream\nadverse health impacts such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.23,38,39 Thyroid hormones have multiple\nforms and include total T4, free T4, and triiodothyronine\n(T3) in both the free and bound forms.

Participants\nwere employees of the City and County of San Francisco or the SFFD.\nFirefighter collaborators and researchers actively recruited study\nparticipants through the Fire Department, as well as firefighter advocacy\norganizations including the San Francisco Firefighters Cancer Prevention\nFoundation, United Fire Service Women, and the International Association\nof Firefighters Union Local 798. Office workers, who were not first\nresponder employees of the City and County of San Francisco, were\nrecruited by listserv emails, tabling at employee events, and presentations\nby research staff and firefighter collaborators. Potential participants\nwere eligible to enroll if they were 18 years or older and nonsmokers.\nFirefighters were required to have worked in the SFFD for a minimum\nof 5 years and be on “active duty” (i.e., currently assigned to a fire station at the time of recruitment).\nThere was no requirement for duration of employment for the office\nworkers. Participants were consented into the study following protocols\napproved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California,\nBerkeley (# 2013-07-5512). All participants\ncompleted an in-person\nexposure assessment interview. Research staff collected demographic\nand basic health information including body mass index (BMI) and the\nuse of hormone replacement medications (relevant interview questions\ncan be found in the Supporting Information). We also asked about possible sources of FR exposure including\ndiet (types and quantities of different foods and food packaging and\npreparation) and occupational activities (time sitting at a computer\nand office furnishings for office workers, fire suppression activities,\nfirehouse activities, and use of personal protective equipment for\nfirefighters). A subset of participants (N = 66)\ngave researchers permission to access their departmental firefighting\nhistory records, from which we abstracted the number of fires fought\nin the 7 days and month prior to the sample collection date to investigate\nif a recent firefighting activity was associated with FR levels. We\nchose to look at this time frame because the half-lives for OFPRs\nvary and are not well-described.21 A trained phlebotomist collected blood in ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid-treated lavender top tubes. Urine specimens were collected by\nparticipants in 60 mL polypropylene biospecimen cups. Biospecimens\nwere put on ice and transferred to the laboratory at the University\nof California, San Francisco, where research staff processed samples\nwithin 3 h of their collection. Blood collection tubes were spun at\n3000 rpm for 10 min and plasma was aliquoted into 1.1 mL cryovial\ntubes. Urine samples were aliquoted into 3.5 mL cryovial tubes. All\nsamples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. We measured FRs in spot urine samples from\nstudy participants. We selected compounds that would likely be detected\nin urine and are potentially in consumer products such as furniture\nand electronics17 and possibly in firefighter\ngear. We measured the following organophosphate metabolites: bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate\n(BDCPP), bis(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (BCEP), dibutyl phosphate (DBuP),\ndibenzyl phosphate, di-p-cresyl phosphate (DpCP),\nand di-o-cresyl phosphate and 2 brominated compounds:\ntetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and the metabolite 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoic\nacid. Quantification of the eight analytes was performed using\nliquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) on\nan Agilent LC 1260 instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,\nCA)—AB Sciex 5500 system (Sciex, Redwood City, CA). To account\nfor urine dilution, we quantified levels of creatinine in participants’\nurine samples (details of the LC–MS/MS method can be found\nin the Supporting Information). To assess potential\nbiological perturbations associated with FR exposures, we measured\nTSH and total T4 in plasma because environmental chemicals\nhave been shown to interact with thyroid hormone transport proteins\nand facilitate metabolism and excretion of the thyroid hormone from\nthe body.45 TSH and total T4 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (antibodies-online,\ncat. no. ABIN2773773) following the manufacturer’s protocol.46 Room-temperature calibrators, controls, and\nsamples (25 μL for T4 and 50 μL for TSH) were\nloaded onto streptavidin-coated wells followed by the addition of\nthe biotinylated antibody for T4 or TSH. Standard curves\nwere constructed in duplicate with calibrators supplied in the kit.\nThe reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then washed\nthree times. Substrate solution was added and stopped after 15 min.\nAbsorbance at 450 nm was read immediately using a microplate reader.\nThe T4 and TSH concentrations of each sample, run in duplicate,\nwere obtained from the standard curve. According to the manufacturer’s\ninstructions, samples below the limit of detection (LOD) were re-run\nwith a 30 min development time. The goal of this analysis was\ntwofold: first, to characterize exposure to FRs and identify potential\npredictors of exposure among firefighters and office workers, and\nsecond, to assess the relationship between exposure to FRs and T4 and TSH. Because of the evidence for skewed distributions\nfor FRs, T4, and TSH, we used nonparametric approaches\nto test differences between groups (permutation, Wilcoxon) and natural\nlog-transformed creatinine values which improved normality for their\nuse in linear models.47 We used two different\nlinear regression models based on whether FR levels were being evaluated\nas the outcome or exposure and to account for FR levels below the\nLOD. In bivariate analyses looking at the relationship between covariates\n(e.g., food consumption or position in the fire department)\nand FR levels as the outcome, we used the maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE) model from the NADA package in R, which accounts for levels\nbelow the LOD without the need for substitution, when the chemical\nmeasurement is the outcome.48 To assess\nthe relationship between FRs (exposure) and thyroid hormone (outcome),\nwe used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models and operationalized\nlevels below the LOD in the following ways: we included all LC–MS/MS\nreported values (even if those values were below the LOD) and substituted  for any remaining nondetect\nvalues. First, we treated FRs as the outcome to evaluate predictors\nof\nmeasured levels and assess differences between firefighters and office\nworkers. We calculated summary statistics for FRs including the geometric\nmean (GM), geometric standard deviation (GSD), and distribution percentiles\nfor each group. In the full group, we assessed the impact of variables\ncollected from the exposure assessment interview on FR levels as the\noutcome using MLE regression. We limited analyses to FRs with a detection\nfrequency (DF) of 70% or higher in at least one group (firefighters\nor office workers) and applied separate MLE regression models on each\nFR chemical (continuous outcome) controlling for occupation and creatinine.\nWe analyzed the relationship between FR levels and the following variables:\nage, race/ethnicity, BMI, and educational attainment controlling for\noccupation and creatinine. We also assessed the relationship between\nFR exposures and eating certain foods and packaged foods based on\nprior literature suggesting an association with FR exposures.49 We then limited the analysis to firefighters\nto explore specific\noccupational activities that might be associated with FR levels such\nas the participant’s assigned position in the fire department\n(i.e., firefighter, officer, or driver), the frequency\nof using a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) during fire suppression,\nsalvage, and overhaul, and the frequency of showering or washing up\nafter a fire event, if the participant was on duty during the 24 h\nprior to sample collection or had been off duty for more than 24 h.\nWe also assessed the number of fires a participant fought in the week\nand month prior to the sample collection to see if fighting a recent\nfire event was associated with FR levels. We used MLE regression and\nexponentiated the β coefficients and 95% confidence interval\n(CI) to find the proportional change in GM for each unit increase\nor category change versus the referent. Next, we assessed the\nassociation between FRs (exposure) and TSH\nand total T4 (outcome) using OLS regression and substitution\nfor FR values below the LOD. We ran separate models for each FR chemical\nand for the outcomes, TSH and total T4. We considered variables\nto adjust for in our models if they demonstrated a statistically significant\nassociation (p-value < 0.05) with the exposure\n(at least one FR) and the outcome (TSH or T4) in our data\nor if the previous literature identified an association (Figure S1). Although age was not associated with\nFRs in our data, it has been associated with thyroid hormone levels\nin other studies50 and therefore we included\nit as a covariate in regression models. We did not control for BMI\nin regression models because studies indicate that thyroid hormone\ndisruption may be associated with increased BMI,51−53 implying that\nit may be a collider for which adjustment could induce a spurious\nassociation. Since neither race/ethnicity nor education were associated\nwith TSH or T4 in our data (data not shown), we did not\ninclude them in final models. We excluded the participants without\nthyroid hormone measurements or who reported taking thyroid hormone\nreplacement medications. Final models were adjusted for age\nand log(creatinine). Due to\nlarge differences in DFs between firefighters and office workers,\nwe stratified the analysis by occupation. We used continuous FR values\nwhen the DF ≥ 70% and we categorized FR values when DF <\n70%. FRs were categorized into the following groups: <LOD and ≥LOD\n(for FRs with a DF of 25 to 50%) and <LOD, LOD to 50th percentile,\nand >50th percentile (for FRs with DF between 50 and 70%). Compounds\nwith DF below 25% were excluded from the multivariate analysis. Results from the OLS regression models with continuous exposure\nand outcome variables were converted to the percent change in the\noutcome for a twofold increase in FR exposure with the formula: (2β – 1) × 100. From OLS regression models\nwith categorical FR exposure and continuous outcomes, we calculated\nthe percent change in the outcome for each category compared to the\nreferent (<LOD) with the formula: (eβ –\n1) × 100. Analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1\nand R-studio version\n1.2.1335.54,55\n\n## Data Collection\nAll participants\ncompleted an in-person\nexposure assessment interview.

We used continuous FR values\nwhen the DF ≥ 70% and we categorized FR values when DF <\n70%. FRs were categorized into the following groups: <LOD and ≥LOD\n(for FRs with a DF of 25 to 50%) and <LOD, LOD to 50th percentile,\nand >50th percentile (for FRs with DF between 50 and 70%). Compounds\nwith DF below 25% were excluded from the multivariate analysis. Results from the OLS regression models with continuous exposure\nand outcome variables were converted to the percent change in the\noutcome for a twofold increase in FR exposure with the formula: (2β – 1) × 100. From OLS regression models\nwith categorical FR exposure and continuous outcomes, we calculated\nthe percent change in the outcome for each category compared to the\nreferent (<LOD) with the formula: (eβ –\n1) × 100. Analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1\nand R-studio version\n1.2.1335.54,55\n\n## Results\nFirefighters had\nboth higher DFs and higher average levels of FR metabolites compared\nto office workers for all FRs, with the largest median differences\nobserved for DBuP, BDCPP, and BCEP (Table 1). Figure 1 shows the distribution [median, interquartile range\n(IQR), and 95th percentile] of each FR detected. BDCPP levels in firefighters\nwere 5 times higher than in office workers. When compared to National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) adult women, firefighters\nhad higher levels of DBuP, BDCPP, and BCEP, while office workers had\nsimilar BDCPP levels but lower levels of DBuP and BCEP compared to\nNHANES women (Figure S2).

Additional information on sources and toxicology\nhighlights is included in Table S1. We applied MLE regression models\nto assess the relationship between\ndescriptive variables and FR levels, controlling for occupation and\nlog(creatinine) (Table 2). We limited the analysis to BDCPP, BCEP, and DBuP since the DF\nwas greater than 70% in at least one group. We found that having a\nBMI of 25.0 to 29.0 as compared to 18.5 to 24.9 was associated with\nincreased levels of BDCPP, BCEP, and DBuP. Likewise, completing a\nbachelor’s degree or higher was associated with elevated FRs\ncompared to those who completed some college or less. Race and ethnicity\nwere not associated with most OPFRs except for BDCPP, where black\nparticipants had a GM 2.52 times (95% CI: 1.10, 5.75) higher than\nwhite participants. We did not find an association between food consumption\nand eating packaged foods with FRs in either firefighters or office\nworkers (Table S2).

Seven participants declined to answer\nheight/weight questions. We then limited the analysis to firefighters to assess occupational\nspecific activities in relation to FR levels (Table 3). We observed that FR levels were higher\nin firefighters who were on duty at the time of the sample collection\n[BDCPP exp(β) (95% CI) = 1.98 (0.92, 4.26) and BCEP (2.76 (0.91,\n8.38))] and we found modest associations by firefighters’ assigned\nrole; officers and firefighters showed slightly elevated levels of\nBDCPP and BCEP compared to drivers. SCBA use in general was associated\nwith lower levels of FRs except for use during exterior fire suppression\nwhich was associated with higher mean BCEP compared to those firefighters\nwho answered that they sometimes used SCBA. Firefighters assigned\nto the San Francisco International Airport fire stations had elevated\nlevels of BDCPP, BCEP, and DBuP compared to firefighters assigned\nto other SFFD stations. Fighting a fire within the 24 h and 7 days\nprior to the sample collection was also modestly associated with BDCPP\nand BCEP levels. The number of hours spent in vehicles per week for\nboth home and work and the number of years worked with the SFFD were\nnot associated with FR levels. Model results show\nthe adjustedb proportional change in GM of\nurine FRs metabolites\nby unit increase or category change from the referent of each variable. Maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE)\nmodels limited to firefighters and adjusted for log(creatinine). N = 66 firefighters\nwho consented to giving researchers access to their SFFD fire history\nrecords. Responses collected\nas “never,\nrarely, sometimes, often, always” and combined due to the low\nfrequency in response categories. DF = detection frequency. T4 and TSH were slightly negatively correlated with\neach other (Spearman\ncorrelation coefficient: −0.13 and p-value\n= 0.1). We found that most participants were within the reference\nrange (i.e., the range of levels that are considered\nnormal)50,56 for both TSH and T4 (Table 4). Six percent (N = 11) of participants had TSH levels outside (below or\nabove) of the reference range and 16 participants (9%) had T4 levels outside the reference range (12 were below the reference\nlevel), with firefighters making up the majority of those either below\nor above the reference range. Abbreviations: GM = geometric mean,\nGSD = geometric standard deviation, and IU = international unit. Chiovato et al. 2019; Hollowell et al. 2002. The final number analyzed for thyroid\nhormone disruption was N = 165 (84 firefighters and\n81 office workers who had T4 and TSH measurements and who\nreported that they were not\ntaking thyroid hormone medications). Average TSH levels were not significantly\ndifferent between firefighters and office workers (permutation test p-value = 0.6); however, average T4 levels were\nborderline different by occupation (permutation test p-value = 0.06). We applied OLS regression models to assess\nthe association between\nFR levels and T4 and TSH controlling for log(creatinine)\nand age. FR levels were not associated with TSH in our models (Table S3); however, we observed a relationship\nbetween several FR metabolites and T4 levels. BDCPP, which\nwe defined as continuous (DF > 70%) in OLS regression models, was\nnegatively associated with T4 (Table 5). In the full group, a twofold increase\nin BDCPP levels was associated with a decrease of 1.95% (95% CI: 3.57,\n0.29) in T4, and in models limited to firefighters, a twofold\nincrease in BDCCP was associated with a T4 decrease of\n2.88% (95% CI: 5.28, 0.42), controlling for age and log(creatinine).\nThe percent change among office workers was smaller (0.23%, 95% CI:\n−2.49, 3.03) and not significant. Models adjusted for age and log(creatinine). Values below LOD replaced with LOD/sqrt(2). Due to large differences in DF for\nDBuP, BCEP, TBBPA, and DpCP\nbetween firefighters and office workers, we ran separate OLS regression\nmodels by occupation for each FR as a predictor and T4 as\na continuous outcome. For office workers, we categorized DBuP, BCEP,\nTBBPA, and DpCP into <LOD and ≥LOD. Among firefighters,\nwe categorized TBBPA and DpCP as <LOD and ≥LOD and categorized\nDBuP and BCEP as <LOD, LOD to 50%, and >50%. Because the DF\nfor\nDBuP and BCEP was >70% for firefighters, we also ran OLS regression\nmodels with the continuous DBuP and BCEP. Although there was evidence\nof lower T4 levels among firefighters for DBuP, the associations\nbetween DBuP or BCEP and T4 were not statistically significant\nfor either firefighters or office workers (Table S4).\n\n## FR Levels and\nPredictors of Exposure\nFirefighters had\nboth higher DFs and higher average levels of FR metabolites compared\nto office workers for all FRs, with the largest median differences\nobserved for DBuP, BDCPP, and BCEP (Table 1).

Our results align with\nprior reports that firefighters have higher levels of FRs compared\nto nonfirefighters and contribute further evidence that FRs may affect\nthyroid function in humans. FRs were detected\nin all firefighters and most office workers tested. Women firefighters\nhad higher DFs and higher average levels of FRs compared to women\noffice workers. BDCPP, BCEP, and DBuP were detected more frequently\nand at higher concentrations among firefighters compared to office\nworkers. BDCPP is a metabolite of TDCPP, an FR that is commonly detected\nin household dust and in furniture foam,57 which may help explain why office workers also had a high DF of\nthis compound. The office workers in our study had similar median\nlevels of BDCPP but higher median levels of BCEP and DBuP compared\nto adult women (age 18+) from the 2013–2014 NHANES, which included\nboth workers and nonworkers and is a nationally representative sample\nof the US population.58 Few demographic\nvariables were associated with FRs. Age, for example, was not associated\nwith FRs in our study possibly because of the limited age range of\nour participants (95% of participants were between the ages of 40\nand 55 for firefighters and 32 and 64 for office workers). The positive\nrelationship we observed between OPFR exposures and BMI is consistent\nwith other studies.51 While black participants\nhad higher levels of BDCPP compared to white participants when controlling\nfor age and occupation, this relationship may in fact reflect other\nunknown exposures and be a function of the limited numbers of black\nparticipants in both the firefighter and office worker groups. California’s flammability standard and the changes implemented\nin 2013 may have affected the exposures in our study population. Concerns\nabout the bioaccumulative properties of brominated FRs and the updated\nregulation TB177-2013 led to a shift away from PBDE FRs in furniture.\nIndeed, studies have observed a decrease in PBDEs in people and the\nenvironment, while levels of OPFRs and other replacement FRs are increasing\nin dust and human biomonitoring studies.16,58−60 Additionally, furniture and electronics in homes\nand offices can be a reservoir for both legacy and replacement FRs;\nmany of these products are not frequently replaced and the chemicals\napplied to them are relatively stable, enabling these compounds to\npersist in homes and offices for decades.59 The elevated levels of organophosphate and brominated FRs in furniture,\nhomes, and offices may also be an important exposure source among\nfirefighters as well as the office workers in our study. Similarly,\nFR-containing furniture may add to the toxic burden of fighting fires\nand translate to higher exposures among firefighters when they respond\nto fires. Studies have shown that fighting fires can contaminate firefighter\ngear, trucks, engines, and equipment, bringing chemical exposures\nindoors.10,61−63 Fire station dust\nand fire-fighting gear are also potentially important\nsources of FRs among firefighters. The increased levels of OPFRs found\nin the women firefighters compared to office workers are consistent\nwith other studies measuring elevated levels of OPFRs in fire station\ndust in the U.S. and abroad. Shen et al. (2018) found\nhigher levels of TDCPP, tri-n-butyl phosphate, and\ntris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate, in dust collected in 2015 from fire\nstations across the U.S., compared to levels measured in homes and\nother occupational settings.10 Similarly,\na study of Australian fire station dust found higher median OPFR levels\nin fire stations than from dust samples collected in homes and offices.63 Firefighter gear is also likely to be a source\nof exposure to FRs. A 2016 study of firefighter gear found that some\nnew hoods and gloves had detectable levels of brominated FRs, but\nto our knowledge, studies have not analyzed firefighter gear for OPFRs.\nNevertheless, firefighter gear may contain FR compounds that can contribute\nto exposures from dust accumulated on the gear from fires and calls.12,64,65 A recent study of firefighting\ngear found that fighting fires may contaminate the hoods firefighters\nwear under their protective equipment with OPFRs.62,64,65 Additionally, laundering may have a limited\nimpact on reducing exposures and, in some cases, may cross-contaminate\ngear.62 We were unable to identify\nspecific sources of FRs or why firefighters\nhad higher levels of exposure than office workers. While durable consumer\ngoods such as couches and mattresses may contribute to levels in the\ngeneral population and fire station dust may be an important source\nin firefighters, this does not fully explain where the FR exposures\nare coming from and why the levels are higher in firefighters. Future\nstudies are needed to elucidate potential sources of exposure to legacy\nand replacement FRs which would facilitate the development and promotion\nof effective exposure prevention strategies. Our study contributes\nto the limited literature on thyroid hormone disruption associated\nwith OPFR exposure among women workers. In addition to demonstrating\nendocrine disruption, changes in thyroid hormone levels can also be\na useful biomarker of biological perturbations relevant to downstream\nhealth effects including breast cancer.30,31 Our results\nshowing associations between FRs with decreased T4 were\nprimarily observed among firefighters, particularly for BDCPP, which\nhad the highest DF of the FRs we measured. The broader range and much\nhigher levels of exposure among the firefighters in our study may\nhave allowed us to observe an association between FR exposure on T4 that we could not among office workers who had lower exposure\nlevels. Our findings support evidence of an association between T4 levels and TDCPP, one that has also been identified in studies\nconducted in vitro, in vivo, and\nin limited human studies.33,35,40 In vitro studies provide evidence for the\nmechanistic plausibility of thyroid hormone disruption from OPFR exposure;\nhowever, the mechanism of effect is not yet understood. Hill et al. (2018) tested the effect of organophosphate triesters\non the binding of T4 and transthyretin (TTR)—one\nof the many transport proteins for T4. They found that\nTDCPP and other organophosphate tri- and di-esters increased the binding\naffinity of T4 with TTR. They hypothesized that organophosphate\ncompounds may bind to the surface of TTR, creating a conformational\nchange allowing more T4 binding and increasing the delivery\nof T4 to target cells resulting in lower circulating levels\nof T4 and disrupting T4 homeostasis.32 Our study provides evidence that exposure to\nTDCPP, and to a lesser extent DBuP, is associated with lower thyroid\nhormone levels. Although we observed small changes in total T4 levels, small disruptions to thyroid hormones can have important\nadverse downstream health effects45 even\nwithin normal ranges or subclinical levels.66 Thyroid dysfunction affects up to 5% of the population and is more\nlikely to affect women than men.50 Identifying\nenvironmental chemical exposures that may be associated with biological\nchanges, such as thyroid disruption could be relevant to adverse health\noutcomes such as cardiovascular disease,38 thyroid disease,44 brain development\nof offspring during gestation, and long-term adverse health outcomes\nsuch as cancer.39 This\nwas a cross-sectional study of the\nassociation between FR exposure and measures of thyroid function,\nwhich precludes making inferences regarding causality. Because we\ndid not quantify free T4, T3, or thyroid peroxidase\nantibody, we were not able to assess clinical outcomes in our participants.\nWhile the ratio of free T4 to TSH is useful for clinical\ndiagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, changes in total T4 can provide important insights on early biological perturbations\nthat may be associated with environmental exposures. Thyroid\ndisease and medications—including thyroid hormone replacement\nmedications—may alter thyroid hormone levels. We asked participants\n“Do you take any hormones other than birth control, such as\nPremarin? If so what?” Although some participants disclosed\ntaking thyroid medications or having thyroid problems, the questionnaire\nmay not have accurately captured all the participants with thyroid\ndysfunction or those who take thyroid hormone replacements nor did\nwe ask about other medications that may affect thyroid hormone levels.\nTherefore, we may not have excluded everyone with artificial or abnormal\nthyroid hormone levels due to illness or medication use rather than\nchemical exposure. This could over- or under-estimate thyroid hormone\nlevels depending on the thyroid problem, making it difficult to predict\nin what direction this could affect our results. Another potential\nlimitation is that we used spot urine samples\nwhen measuring FR levels, potentially increasing the variability of\nthe urine concentration and of chemicals measured in our samples.\nStudies describing the stability of OPFRs over time vary;67,68 however, the variability would be nondifferential between firefighters\nand office workers and not likely to affect the differences we observed\nin their chemical levels nor the FR’s relationship with potential\ncovariates. In addition, samples were collected in the morning for\nmost participants, and we measured and adjusted for creatinine to\naccount for urine dilution, reducing some of this variability.47 Finally, there may be residual confounding\nfrom co-exposures that\nwe were not able to measure. Our sample size was modest and may have\nlimited statistical power to detect associations between FR levels\nand exposure sources, as well as associations between FR exposure\nand thyroid hormone disruption, especially at the lower exposure levels\nwe observed in office workers. This is the first study to measure\nFR exposure in a study of women\nfirefighters and office workers. Most participants had detectable\nlevels of at least one OPFR, and both DFs and levels were much higher\namong women firefighters than in women office workers, especially\nfor BDCPP, DBuP, and BCEP. Median levels of the carcinogen metabolite\nBDCPP were 5 times higher in firefighters than for office workers.\nAdditionally, exposure to BDCPP, and to a smaller extent DBuP, was\nassociated with decreased levels of total T4, particularly\namong firefighters. The observed thyroid hormone disruption may indicate\npotential biological perturbations resulting from occupational exposure\nto these compounds. Further research is needed to understand exposure\nsources in occupational settings and fully characterize potential\nhealth impacts of these replacement FRs.\n\n## FR Levels and Predictors of Exposure\nFRs were detected\nin all firefighters and most office workers tested. Women firefighters\nhad higher DFs and higher average levels of FRs compared to women\noffice workers. BDCPP, BCEP, and DBuP were detected more frequently\nand at higher concentrations among firefighters compared to office\nworkers. BDCPP is a metabolite of TDCPP, an FR that is commonly detected\nin household dust and in furniture foam,57 which may help explain why office workers also had a high DF of\nthis compound. The office workers in our study had similar median\nlevels of BDCPP but higher median levels of BCEP and DBuP compared\nto adult women (age 18+) from the 2013–2014 NHANES, which included\nboth workers and nonworkers and is a nationally representative sample\nof the US population.58 Few demographic\nvariables were associated with FRs. Age, for example, was not associated\nwith FRs in our study possibly because of the limited age range of\nour participants (95% of participants were between the ages of 40\nand 55 for firefighters and 32 and 64 for office workers). The positive\nrelationship we observed between OPFR exposures and BMI is consistent\nwith other studies.51 While black participants\nhad higher levels of BDCPP compared to white participants when controlling\nfor age and occupation, this relationship may in fact reflect other\nunknown exposures and be a function of the limited numbers of black\nparticipants in both the firefighter and office worker groups. California’s flammability standard and the changes implemented\nin 2013 may have affected the exposures in our study population. Concerns\nabout the bioaccumulative properties of brominated FRs and the updated\nregulation TB177-2013 led to a shift away from PBDE FRs in furniture.\nIndeed, studies have observed a decrease in PBDEs in people and the\nenvironment, while levels of OPFRs and other replacement FRs are increasing\nin dust and human biomonitoring studies.16,58−60 Additionally, furniture and electronics in homes\nand offices can be a reservoir for both legacy and replacement FRs;\nmany of these products are not frequently replaced and the chemicals\napplied to them are relatively stable, enabling these compounds to\npersist in homes and offices for decades.59 The elevated levels of organophosphate and brominated FRs in furniture,\nhomes, and offices may also be an important exposure source among\nfirefighters as well as the office workers in our study. Similarly,\nFR-containing furniture may add to the toxic burden of fighting fires\nand translate to higher exposures among firefighters when they respond\nto fires. Studies have shown that fighting fires can contaminate firefighter\ngear, trucks, engines, and equipment, bringing chemical exposures\nindoors.10,61−63 Fire station dust\nand fire-fighting gear are also potentially important\nsources of FRs among firefighters. The increased levels of OPFRs found\nin the women firefighters compared to office workers are consistent\nwith other studies measuring elevated levels of OPFRs in fire station\ndust in the U.S. and abroad.

The broader range and much\nhigher levels of exposure among the firefighters in our study may\nhave allowed us to observe an association between FR exposure on T4 that we could not among office workers who had lower exposure\nlevels. Our findings support evidence of an association between T4 levels and TDCPP, one that has also been identified in studies\nconducted in vitro, in vivo, and\nin limited human studies.33,35,40 In vitro studies provide evidence for the\nmechanistic plausibility of thyroid hormone disruption from OPFR exposure;\nhowever, the mechanism of effect is not yet understood. Hill et al. (2018) tested the effect of organophosphate triesters\non the binding of T4 and transthyretin (TTR)—one\nof the many transport proteins for T4. They found that\nTDCPP and other organophosphate tri- and di-esters increased the binding\naffinity of T4 with TTR. They hypothesized that organophosphate\ncompounds may bind to the surface of TTR, creating a conformational\nchange allowing more T4 binding and increasing the delivery\nof T4 to target cells resulting in lower circulating levels\nof T4 and disrupting T4 homeostasis.32 Our study provides evidence that exposure to\nTDCPP, and to a lesser extent DBuP, is associated with lower thyroid\nhormone levels. Although we observed small changes in total T4 levels, small disruptions to thyroid hormones can have important\nadverse downstream health effects45 even\nwithin normal ranges or subclinical levels.66 Thyroid dysfunction affects up to 5% of the population and is more\nlikely to affect women than men.50 Identifying\nenvironmental chemical exposures that may be associated with biological\nchanges, such as thyroid disruption could be relevant to adverse health\noutcomes such as cardiovascular disease,38 thyroid disease,44 brain development\nof offspring during gestation, and long-term adverse health outcomes\nsuch as cancer.39\n\n## Limitations\nThis\nwas a cross-sectional study of the\nassociation between FR exposure and measures of thyroid function,\nwhich precludes making inferences regarding causality. Because we\ndid not quantify free T4, T3, or thyroid peroxidase\nantibody, we were not able to assess clinical outcomes in our participants.\nWhile the ratio of free T4 to TSH is useful for clinical\ndiagnosis of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, changes in total T4 can provide important insights on early biological perturbations\nthat may be associated with environmental exposures. Thyroid\ndisease and medications—including thyroid hormone replacement\nmedications—may alter thyroid hormone levels. We asked participants\n“Do you take any hormones other than birth control, such as\nPremarin? If so what?” Although some participants disclosed\ntaking thyroid medications or having thyroid problems, the questionnaire\nmay not have accurately captured all the participants with thyroid\ndysfunction or those who take thyroid hormone replacements nor did\nwe ask about other medications that may affect thyroid hormone levels.\nTherefore, we may not have excluded everyone with artificial or abnormal\nthyroid hormone levels due to illness or medication use rather than\nchemical exposure. This could over- or under-estimate thyroid hormone\nlevels depending on the thyroid problem, making it difficult to predict\nin what direction this could affect our results. Another potential\nlimitation is that we used spot urine samples\nwhen measuring FR levels, potentially increasing the variability of\nthe urine concentration and of chemicals measured in our samples.\nStudies describing the stability of OPFRs over time vary;67,68 however, the variability would be nondifferential between firefighters\nand office workers and not likely to affect the differences we observed\nin their chemical levels nor the FR’s relationship with potential\ncovariates. In addition, samples were collected in the morning for\nmost participants, and we measured and adjusted for creatinine to\naccount for urine dilution, reducing some of this variability.47 Finally, there may be residual confounding\nfrom co-exposures that\nwe were not able to measure. Our sample size was modest and may have\nlimited statistical power to detect associations between FR levels\nand exposure sources, as well as associations between FR exposure\nand thyroid hormone disruption, especially at the lower exposure levels\nwe observed in office workers. This is the first study to measure\nFR exposure in a study of women\nfirefighters and office workers. Most participants had detectable\nlevels of at least one OPFR, and both DFs and levels were much higher\namong women firefighters than in women office workers, especially\nfor BDCPP, DBuP, and BCEP. Median levels of the carcinogen metabolite\nBDCPP were 5 times higher in firefighters than for office workers.\nAdditionally, exposure to BDCPP, and to a smaller extent DBuP, was\nassociated with decreased levels of total T4, particularly\namong firefighters. The observed thyroid hormone disruption may indicate\npotential biological perturbations resulting from occupational exposure\nto these compounds. Further research is needed to understand exposure\nsources in occupational settings and fully characterize potential\nhealth impacts of these replacement FRs.",
