  "abstract": "Abstract The increasing use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2  NPs) across various fields has led to a growing concern regarding their environmental contamination and inevitable human exposure. Consequently, significant research efforts have been directed toward understanding the effects of TiO 2  NPs on both humans and the environment. Notably, TiO 2  NPs exposure has been associated with multiple impairments of the nervous system. This review aims to provide an overview of the documented neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs in different species and in vitro models. Following exposure, TiO 2  NPs can reach the brain, although the specific mechanism and quantity of particles that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remain unclear. Exposure to TiO 2  NPs has been shown to induce oxidative stress, promote neuroinflammation, disrupt brain biochemistry, and ultimately impair neuronal function and structure. Subsequent neuronal damage may contribute to various behavioral disorders and play a significant role in the onset and progression of neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs can be influenced by various factors, including exposure characteristics and the physicochemical properties of the TiO 2  NPs. However, a systematic comparison of the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs with different characteristics under various exposure conditions is still lacking. Additionally, our understanding of the underlying neurotoxic mechanisms exerted by TiO 2  NPs remains incomplete and fragmented. Given these knowledge gaps, it is imperative to further investigate the neurotoxic hazards and risks associated with exposure to TiO 2  NPs.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Nanomaterials (NMs) are materials defined as having at least one dimension ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm). Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2  NPs) rank among the top five NMs used in consumer products, such as food additives, toys, cosmetics, electronic products, and pharmaceuticals ( Figure 1 ). 1 , 2  Consequently, the presence of TiO 2  NPs in air, water, soil, and other environmental media has gradually increased due to their widespread use. 3  This growing application and contamination have made human and animal exposure to TiO 2  NPs unavoidable. Apart from skin exposure, inhalation, and oral exposure, other routes of exposure to TiO 2  NPs include intraperitoneal injection, subcutaneous injection, and intramuscular injection. 4  Importantly, regardless of the route of exposure, TiO 2  NPs can ultimately enter the systemic circulation and translocate to various tissues and organs ( Figure 2 ). 4  As the accumulation of TiO 2  NPs in the body increases, the associated health hazards become more severe. 5 \n Figure 1 Application of TiO 2  NPs. \n Figure 2 TiO 2  NPs can enter the human body through different ways and accumulate in the body, posing a threat to human health.\n\nApplication of TiO 2  NPs.\n\nTiO 2  NPs can enter the human body through different ways and accumulate in the body, posing a threat to human health.\n\nBefore the rise of nanotechnology, TiO 2  was widely used in the form of fine particles (FPs), which were considered as poor soluble and low toxicity particles. 6  However, some studies have contradicted this view, such as lung tumors in rats exposed to high levels of TiO 2  FPs for two years. 7  Furthermore, TiO 2  has been classified as a Group 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic to humans) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. 8  Although the specific carcinogenicity of TiO 2  FPs is still debated, there is no doubt that TiO 2  FPs pose a health risk. 9  Compared to TiO 2  FPs, TiO 2  NPs present stronger catalytic activity and bioactivity due to their nanoscale dimensions. 9  Consequently, the toxicity of TiO 2  NPs cannot be solely inferred from the known toxicology of TiO 2  FPs, nor can it be determined using conventional methods. 10  In recent years, extensive exploration of the effects of TiO 2  NPs exposure on human health also reflects the high concern about the safety of TiO 2  NPs. In addition to considering all relevant exposure scenarios and biological intermediate steps, understanding the final toxic outcome is critical for human health risk assessment. 11  Results from another child cohort study in China indicated that Ti can cross the placental barrier (PB) to harm fetuses that are extremely sensitive to environmental threats. 12  Several epidemiological studies have confirmed that Ti exposure increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, including neural tube defects, preterm birth, fetal distress, and low birth weight. 13–15  Moreover, TiO 2  NP exposure can have detrimental effects on the health of the population beyond the fetus. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggests that higher levels of urinary or blood Ti are associated with an increased risk of various adverse health effects, including diabetes and cardiopulmonary disorders ( Figure 2 ). 16–19  In recent years, laboratory studies on the toxicity of TiO 2  NPs have surpassed epidemiological studies. Common animal models such as mice, rats, zebrafish, and  Drosophila  have been used to study TiO 2  NPs. In vivo, studies have shown that TiO 2  NPs exposure may be linked to lung inflammation, pneumoconiosis, cardiovascular disease, reproductive toxicity, retinal impairments, etc. 20–24  In vitro, studies have also supported these toxic effects of TiO 2  NPs. 25–28  Given that nanoparticles can enter the brain, concerns regarding their neurotoxic effects, including those of TiO 2  NPs, have gained significant attention. 29\n\nThe entry of TiO 2  NPs into the brain mainly occurs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), via absorption-mediated transversion or intranasal pathways. 30 , 31  However, the mechanisms by which nano-titanium dioxide penetrates and targets different brain regions remain unknown. The degree of TiO 2  NPs accumulation in each brain region closely correlates with the extent of neurotoxic effects. Common neurotoxic effects include behavior deficits, nervous system dysfunction, and structural changes induced by oxidative stress, autophagy, inflammation, or the activation of specific signaling pathways. 32  Although emerging studies support the role of TiO 2  NPs exposure as an environmental risk factor for human health, conscientious and systematic investigations are scarce into the extent of TiO 2  NPs translocation to different brain regions and the resulting damage to the neuronal system in relation to particle dose and particle size. The lack of information on the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs also complicates risk assessment following exposure. Therefore, this paper will mainly focus on current studies concerning the neurotoxicology of TiO 2  NPs, while also reviewing the molecular mechanisms underlying their neurotoxic effects to mitigate potential damage resulting from exposure."

      "title": "Evidence from Epidemiological and Human Exposure Studies",
      "text": "In earlier years, population exposure to TiO 2  NPs was primarily investigated among occupational populations. Welding fumes, industrial waste combustion, and mineral mining can all result in environmental contamination by TiO 2  NPs, thereby increasing the exposure risk for workers. 33  Exposure to fumes from metal-inert gas soldering has been found to increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD). 34  Although these fumes mainly consist of zinc, copper, and iron, Andujar et al discovered an excessive accumulation of Ti in the lung tissue sections of welders in 2014. 35  Industrial waste, pesticides, and automobile exhaust are common sources of environmental pollutants associated with neurotoxic effects. 36  Among various environmental pollutants, NPs can easily penetrate the BBB and induce neurotoxicity by activating innate immune responses in astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. 36  TiO 2  NPs are a major component among environmental pollutants, with up to 760 tons of TiO 2  NPs being released into the soil through sewage and sludge each year. 37 , 38  Currently, there is no direct evidence of neurotoxic effects caused by TiO 2  NPs exposure in mineral miners, but a previous study suggested a significantly increased inflammatory response in mineral miners exposed to TiO 2  NPs. 39  It is well known that the occurrence of inflammatory reactions in other organs is closely related to nervous system damage. 40  With the increasing application of TiO 2  NPs, concerns have also arisen regarding the neurotoxic effects of non-occupational populations exposed to TiO 2  NPs. A recent cohort study demonstrated that high levels of urinary Ti during pregnancy were significantly associated with impaired language development, suggesting that TiO 2  NPs might act as developmental neurotoxicants. 41  Furthermore, elevated levels of Ti in maternal hair were also significantly associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects. 42  However, epidemiological studies on the neurotoxic effects caused by TiO 2  NPs are still limited. Currently, laboratory studies are the main basis for evaluating the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs."

      "text": "To review the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the “Pubmed” database, covering articles from 1991 to September 29, 2023. The search utilized combinations of the following keywords: Titanium dioxide nanoparticles exposure; E171 exposure; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles neuron; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles brain; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles behavior; and Titanium dioxide nanoparticles neurotoxicology. Our search strategy involved an initial screening of all titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text review of the pertinent review articles. One hundred forty-seven papers were selected, including one hundred twenty-one research papers. Citations within twenty-six reviews were also screened for additional studies not identified in the electronic search; however, no additional research papers were found through these references. In the end, a total of one hundred and twenty-one research papers were selected, all of which included neurotoxicity endpoints in their experimental designs.\n\nFor experimental research, we identified in vitro or in vivo studies involving the administration of TiO 2  NPs. The researched organism groups mainly consisted of rodents, zebrafish, and cells. Fifty-five studies were conducted on rodents, twenty on zebrafish, and two on  Caenorhabditis elegans  ( C. elegans ), while one each on  Pheretima hawayana, Tegillarca granosa , and  Drosophila melanogaster . Additionally, forty-one studies used in vitro cells, including various animals and human-derived neuronal cells ( Figure 3 ).\n Figure 3 Study selection flow diagram.

      "title": "Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Rodents",
      "text": "The results of the literature search demonstrate that rodents were the most commonly used species in neurotoxicity studies of TiO 2  NPs, forming the basis of 55 articles. Among these, 23 articles focused on rat models, with the Wistar rat being the most commonly employed. The exposed TiO 2  NPs generally had a particle size of less than 20 nm, and the exposure doses ranged below 200 mg/kg ( Table 1 ). Intratracheal instillation, intragastric administration, intravenous injection, and intraperitoneal injection are common methods of rat exposure to TiO 2  NPs. Pregnancy and lactation have been identified as critical periods of neurodevelopment and have been selected as exposure windows to toxicants in many neurotoxicological studies, including the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs. 43–45  Exposure to TiO 2  NPs (10 nm, 100 mg/kg) during pregnancy or lactation has been found to impair memory and learning in Wistar offspring rats by reducing hippocampal cell proliferation. 44 , 46  Prenatal exposure to TiO 2  NPs (5 nm, 1 μg/μL) via subcutaneous injection has been shown to enhance depressive-like behavior in adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. 47  Additionally, Engler-Chiurazzi et al conducted locomotion, learning, and anxiety tests on male adult SD rats and observed significant cognitive impairments in offspring resulting from inhalation exposure to TiO 2  NPs (170.9 ± 6.4 nm, 10.4 ± 0.4 mg/m 3 ) during pregnancy. 48  In earlier studies, the roles of age and sex in early-life exposure at different developmental stages were often overlooked. However, a recent study demonstrated that female pups were more susceptible to adverse outcomes after early exposure to oral TiO 2  NPs (postnatal day, PND 2–5 or PND 7–10) compared to male pups, while male pups exhibited more severe motor deficits following exposure to nano-titanium dioxide during late lactation (PND 17–20). 45  The behavioral impairments resulting from TiO 2  NPs exposure during pregnancy and lactation involve multiple mechanisms, including oxidative damage, changes in neurotransmitter concentrations, and metabolic disturbances. 45 , 47  Furthermore, exposure to TiO 2  NPs during pregnancy has been associated with neuronal apoptosis, decreased neurogenesis, altered expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and impaired synaptic plasticity. 49–51 \n Table 1 Overview of Literature Investigating Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Rats Model System Particle Size Exposure Method Exposure Time Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

Among them, 21 studies used ICR mice, 7 studies used C57BL/6, 2 studies used Albino mice, while BALB/c mice and Swiss Webster mice were used in 1 study each ( Table 2 ). The exposure methods used in most of the neurotoxicological studies of TiO 2  NPs using mice as animal models mimic the actual pathways of human exposure to TiO 2  NPs. TiO 2  NPs can enter the human body via intentional or unintentional inhalation; therefore, intranasal administration was chosen as the exposure method in 10 studies. Intranasal drug administration is a promising method to bypass BBB, resulting in higher bioavailability and greater brain exposure compared to oral administration at the same dose. 71  Several studies have shown that intranasal administration of TiO 2  NPs in mice resulted in various neurological damages, including hippocampal cell apoptosis, tissue necrosis, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, imbalance of glutamate metabolism, and altered gene expression. 72–79  These structural and functional impairments in the nervous system are closely related to behavioral deficits. Ze et al found that exposure to TiO 2  NPs (208–330 nm, 2.5 mg/kg body weight, BW) for 90 consecutive days via intranasal administration damaged the hippocampus structure, decreased long-term potentiation, altered gene expression, and caused spatial recognition deficits. 80  Intragastric administration, a method commonly used to assess the effects of oral exposure in the hazard assessment of environmental toxicants, was employed in 13 neurotoxicological studies of TiO 2  NPs using mice as animal models. 81  Pregnancy exposure to TiO 2  NPs (21 nm, 150 mg/kg) via intragastric administration caused the delayed appearance of neurobehavioral impairments in both dams and offspring, which may be related to disruption of the gut-brain axis. 82 , 83  Furthermore, exposure to low levels of TiO 2  NPs (6.5 nm, < 5 mg/kg) via intragastric administration during pregnancy and lactation retarded axonal and dendritic outgrowth, impaired cognitive ability, and increased hippocampal neurons apoptosis. 84–86  In addition to common impairments in the nervous system associated with TiO 2  NPs exposure, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and altered gene expression, Wang et al found that exposure to TiO 2  NPs (10 nm) increased the risk of PD. 87 \n Table 2 Overview of the Literature Investigating Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Mice Model System Particle Size Exposure Method Exposure Time Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

To date, only five studies investigated the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs exposure in other animal models, namely  C. elegans, Tegillarca granosa, Pheretima hawayana , and  Drosophila  melanogaster ( Table 4 ).\n Table 4 Overview of the Literature Investigating Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Other Animal Models Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

Its small size, short life cycle, and high reproductive rate make  C. elegans  an advantageous model in neuroscience. 132  Long-term exposure to TiO 2  NPs (10 nm) resulted in severe defects in the development of AVL and DVB neurons that control defecation in nematodes. 127  Neurons exposed to both anatase and rutile TiO 2  NPs exhibited shorter axon growth, which may be the reason for defective locomotion behavior in nematodes. 128\n\nDrosophila melanogaster  is an excellent animal model for evaluating the neurotoxicity of various NPs due to its low-cost, physiological similarities to humans, and well-known behavioral and developmental characteristics. 133 , 134  The results of a recent study indicated that chronic exposure to TiO 2  NPs (approximately 20 nm, 20 mg/kg) induced deficits in motor behavior by disrupting the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila. 129\n\nTegillarca granosa  and  Pheretima hawayana  are rarely studied in neurotoxicological research involving NPs.  Tegillarca granosa  inhabits intertidal mudflat, where the concentration of NPs is predicted to be higher than in other parts of the ocean. 135  Selecting  Tegillarca granosa  as an animal model provides better insights into the neurotoxicity of NPs in marine bivalve mollusks. 130  Exposure to TiO 2  NPs (200 nm) increased neurotransmitters concentrations, suppressed the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and decreased the expression of neurotransmitter-related genes, which may disrupt various physiological processes in  Tegillarca granosa . 130  While TiO 2  NPs are increasingly being released into the soil, their effects on soil biota remain largely unknown. 136  The traditional sentinel species for soil toxicity testing is the earthworm, and  Pheretima hawayana  is a species of Egyptian earthworm. Exposure to TiO 2  NPs altered biochemical indices related to the function of the nervous system, such as inhibiting AChE, increasing antioxidant enzymes, and accumulating malondialdehyde (MDA). 131"

      "text": "In vitro models are widely used to assess neurotoxic effects on cellular functions. 137  Several studies have evaluated the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs using in vitro models. Primary hippocampal and cortical neurons are widely used in vitro models for neurotoxicology testing as they are easily polarized and form unique axons and dendrites. In addition, these models are used to study neuronal polarization, axon/dendrite morphology, synaptic formation, and central nervous system (CNS) functions. 138  Exposure to TiO 2  NPs impairs neuronal function, inhibits neuroblast proliferation, reduces cell viability, and increases cell apoptosis by promoting oxidative stress in both primary hippocampal and cortical neurons. 139–144  Furthermore, TiO 2  NPs inhibit neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons by interfering with glutamate metabolism and impairing N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor function. 145  According to some previous studies, the suppression of axonal development, dendritic development, and synapse development by TiO 2  NPs was associated with decreased expression of axon growth-related factors and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin and BDNF-TrkB pathways. 146–148  See  Table 5  for details.\n Table 5 Overview of the Literature on Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs on Primary Neuron and Nerve Cell Lines Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

PC12 cell line shows morphological and functional differentiation similar to sympathetic neurons. PC12 cell line is a suitable model for studying the chemical disruption of neuronal differentiation, synthesis, storage, and release of neurotransmitters, function and regulation of ion channels, and the interaction of compounds with membrane-bound receptors. 160  A previous study revealed that treatment of PC12 cells with TiO 2  NPs (< 36 nm, < 200 μg/mL) decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis via oxidative stress, inhibited the neurite outgrowth, disturbed cell cycle, and disrupted the ubiquitin-proteasome system. 149–151  The human-derived SH-SY5Y cell line is preferred over the PC12 cell line as it avoids interspecific differences in chemical action. 161  The SH-SY5Y cell line is an excellent model for studying toxicity on proliferating or differentiated cells because it can be maintained as neuroblasts or induced to differentiate into more neuron-like morphologies. 161  TiO 2  NPs were shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy, inhibition of cell proliferation, disturbance of the microtubule dynamics, and membrane damage in SH-SY5Y cells. 153–158  Several in vivo studies investigated the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on mouse hippocampus. However, one in vitro study explored the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. The study revealed that TiO 2  NPs increased apoptosis of HT22 cells via oxidative stress- and calcium imbalance-mediated ER stress. 159\n\nAcute or prolonged exposure to TiO 2  NPs is associated with toxic effects on neuronal and glial cells. 162  Glial cells are critical cells of the nervous system, which serve as tissue-resident macrophages. Microglia are crucial regulators that influence nervous system development, maintenance of the neural environment, and response to injury and repair. 163  The immortalized mouse microglia cell line BV2 is often used as an alternative for primary microglia in cell experiments. Some previous studies showed that exposure of BV2 cells to TiO 2  NPs was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress. 28 , 164  Astrocytes play a key role in innate and adaptive immune responses in CNS injury. 165  Due to advancements in cell culture technology, primary astrocytes have become a common primary cell model. Previous studies revealed that TiO 2  NPs induced mitochondria damage, oxidative stress, autophagy, neuroinflammation, and cell apoptosis in primary rat cortical astrocytes. 166–168  Other studies employed human glial cell lines as in vitro models for neurotoxicity studies to eliminate species differences. Some previous studies revealed that TiO 2  NPs inhibited cell proliferation, induced morphological changes, decreased immuno-location of F-actin fibers, and increased cell apoptosis in U374 cells. 169 , 170  Furthermore, several studies have investigated the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs in a co-culture of glial cells and other cells. For example, Yang et al showed that TiO 2  NPs stimulate the inflammatory reaction in brain microglia and damage neuron using a co-culture model of primary microglia and PC12 cell line. 171  Similarly, TiO 2  NPs was shown to stimulate the inflammatory reaction in brain microglia and damage neurons in co-culture models of BV2 and N27 mesencephalic neurons, and BV2 and N2a neuroblastoma cells. 172 , 173  See  Table 6  for details.\n Table 6 Overview of the Literature on Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Primary Glial Cells and Glial Cell Lines Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on other brain regions. The BBB is effective in protecting the brain from chemical damage. Therefore, there is a need to understand the effects of TiO 2  NP S  on the BBB. A previous study exploring the effects of TiO 2  NPs on an in vitro model of BBB established by co-culturing primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and primary human astrocytes, revealed that TiO 2  NPs increased the permeability of the BBB. 31  Another study showed that acute or long-term exposure of an in vitro model of the BBB established by co-culturing primary rat endothelial cells and glial cells to TiO 2  NPs was associated with BBB dysfunction related to increased inflammatory response and altered expression of the ABC transporter. 174  Moreover, treatment of T98G human glioblastoma cells with TiO 2  NPs was associated with changes in the transcriptome, suggesting that exposure to TiO 2  NPs could compromise BBB integrity and cause neuroinflammation. 175  Furthermore, TiO 2  NPs can be internalized by dorsal root ganglion cells (DRG) and cause damage via apoptosis. 176 , 177  Yu et al showed an association between the toxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on olfactory bulb neuron cells and its pathogenicity to neurodegenerative diseases. 178  Furthermore, exposure to TiO 2  NPs was associated with varying degrees of cytotoxicity to the human cerebral endothelial cell line (HCECs), human neural stem cell line (hNSCs), and neuroectodermal stem cell line (1C11) models. 179–181  See  Table 7  for details.\n Table 7 Overview of the Literature on Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Other Cells Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

      "title": "Factors Influencing the Neurotoxic Potential of TiO 2  NPs",
      "text": "The neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs are influenced by various factors. The exposure characteristics, such as exposure dose, method, duration, and species, can influence the toxic effects of TiO 2  NPs in vivo. A review of the literature showed that the exposure dose in vivo and in vitro experiments was larger than the actual exposure dose of the population. According to a previous study, the levels of TiO 2  NPs in air and water ranged from 0.7 to 16 μg/L. 182  It is estimated that children have an intake of TiO 2  NPs of about 2–3 mg/kg/day, while adults have a TiO 2  NPs intake of about 1 mg/kg/day. 2  Human exposure to TiO 2  NPs is mainly through dietary intake and air inhalation. Although the exposure methods selected in animal studies attempted to mimic human exposure closely, there are some gaps. For example, the system for intranasal administration is simple compared to inhalation administration. Furthermore, intranasal administration is significantly affected by the inhalational dose. 183  The intranasal administration volumes in rodents at a given time should be limited to approximately 5 μL per nostril since volumes greater than this are likely to become wasted. 184 , 185  Furthermore, ingested TiO 2  NPs first interacts with the oral mucosa. However, intragastric administration does not interact with the oral mucosa and is thus associated with significant differences in absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism with implications for assumptions and models of toxicity kinetics. 81  In addition, the exposure period and duration also influence the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs. 45 , 94  However, the exposure duration in experiments tends to be shorter than that in humans. Species differences are often unavoidable. Therefore, there is a need to conduct epidemiological studies exploring the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on humans.\n\nFurthermore, the physical and chemical properties of TiO 2  NPs can affect their neurotoxicity. Particle size is key. In general, small particles are more likely to be absorbed and thus exert toxic effects. 186  According to some previous studies, the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs depend on particle size. 60 , 168  The hydrodynamic diameter or secondary particle sizes of TiO 2  NPs are important with respect to neurotoxicity. While smaller NPs may seem more neurotoxic, they are also more likely to clump together and form aggregates. 186  Theoretically, the particle aggregation would increase the effective particle size thus reducing the neurotoxic potential. Several studies have used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the effects of hydrodynamics or secondary particle size of TiO 2  NPs on neurotoxicity. However, no studies have explored the effect of aggregate particle size on the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs. The zeta potential of TiO 2  NPs has also been investigated in most neurotoxicological studies. Since most cell membranes are negatively charged, the zeta potential affects the tendency of NPs to penetrate the membrane, with cationic particles generally exhibiting higher toxicity associated with cell wall damage. 187  Furthermore, the surface charge of the nanoparticles can determine the degree of aggregation. 122 , 162 , 164  However, further studies are needed to investigate whether the zeta potential affects the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs. In addition, the toxicity of TiO 2  NPs is dependent on crystalline phases. The anatase form of TiO 2  NPs is more neurotoxic than that of rutile TiO 2  NPs and P25 TiO 2  NPs since anatase has a higher ability to induce oxidative stress. 152 , 166 , 188\n\nTaken together, various factors can affect the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs, including physical and chemical properties of TiO 2  NPs, and exposure dose, exposure duration, exposed species. However, the specific effects of these factors on the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs still need to be systematically compared."

      "title": "Reflections on Neurotoxicity Induced by TiO 2  NPs",
      "text": "Most studies to date have focused on rodents, and most experimental exposures used are not very realistic for human exposure. In addition, there is currently limited information on the levels of TiO 2  NPs in the environment, consumer goods, and food products. For humans, more accurate monitoring is needed to determine daily exposure levels, particle characteristics and exposure route, all of which affect the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs. Evaluating and availing data on TiO 2  NPs levels in different environmental media helps to reliably estimate human exposure and thus assess the risk of TiO 2  NPs. Furthermore, the degree of uptake through the digestive system, respiratory system, potential BBB crossing, and potential translocation to or even accumulation in nervous system should be further investigated. This information will indicate which route of exposure mitigation is most valuable for human health protection. However, apart from the recommended exposure limits (REL) established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), no other regulatory agencies have set occupational or environmental exposure limits for TiO 2  NPs. 9  There are limitations in the monitoring methods of TiO 2  NPs. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate methods for reducing TiO 2  NPs in environmental media and food to prevent their potentially harmful health effects. 189\n\nThe specific mechanisms behind the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs have only been explored through animal and cell experiments. TiO 2  NPs increase the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain, thus inducing oxidative stress. Ze et al reported that TiO 2  NPs induced oxidative stress thus causing brain damage through overactivation of the p38-Nrf-2 signaling pathway. 78  Oxidative stress can induce neuroinflammation, thus further aggravating cell damage. 63 , 73 , 92  Cell damage, including structural and functional damage, is associated with increased onset and development of neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and PD. 87 , 100  Cell damage is also linked to behavioral deficits. 46 , 57  Abnormal motor ability could be caused by a decrease in the axon length of motor neurons. 120  In addition, changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity could lead to decreased spatial recognition. 80  The development of axons, dendrites and synapses is regulated by various signaling pathways. TiO 2  NPs impair the growth of axons and dendrites through excessive activation of the ERK1/2/MAPK signaling pathway. 84  In addition, impairment of dendritic growth by TiO 2  NPs is also related to inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. 147  Moreover, suppression of the neuronal synaptic outgrowth by TiO 2  NPs is linked to the inhibition of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. 148  Furthermore, the accumulation of TiO 2  NPs in the brain could cause alterations in brain biochemistry and changes in neurotransmitter levels, contributing to behavioral changes. 45 , 57 , 117  Although all of these studies confirm that TiO 2  NPs cause neurotoxic effects through different mechanisms, most of the evidence on the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs is fragmentary and is obtained from different species. Furthermore, few of these mechanism studies have explored whether the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs are mediated through synergistic interactions of multiple brain regions, organs, and systems. Whether TiO 2  NPs with different characteristics cause different degrees of toxic effects through different mechanisms remains be further explored. Extensive systematic studies are needed to fully elucidate the neurotoxic mechanisms of TiO 2  NPs, which will be helpful for the prevention and treatment of neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs."

  "full_text": "Abstract The increasing use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2  NPs) across various fields has led to a growing concern regarding their environmental contamination and inevitable human exposure. Consequently, significant research efforts have been directed toward understanding the effects of TiO 2  NPs on both humans and the environment. Notably, TiO 2  NPs exposure has been associated with multiple impairments of the nervous system. This review aims to provide an overview of the documented neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs in different species and in vitro models. Following exposure, TiO 2  NPs can reach the brain, although the specific mechanism and quantity of particles that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remain unclear. Exposure to TiO 2  NPs has been shown to induce oxidative stress, promote neuroinflammation, disrupt brain biochemistry, and ultimately impair neuronal function and structure. Subsequent neuronal damage may contribute to various behavioral disorders and play a significant role in the onset and progression of neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs can be influenced by various factors, including exposure characteristics and the physicochemical properties of the TiO 2  NPs. However, a systematic comparison of the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs with different characteristics under various exposure conditions is still lacking. Additionally, our understanding of the underlying neurotoxic mechanisms exerted by TiO 2  NPs remains incomplete and fragmented. Given these knowledge gaps, it is imperative to further investigate the neurotoxic hazards and risks associated with exposure to TiO 2  NPs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nNanomaterials (NMs) are materials defined as having at least one dimension ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm). Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2  NPs) rank among the top five NMs used in consumer products, such as food additives, toys, cosmetics, electronic products, and pharmaceuticals ( Figure 1 ). 1 , 2  Consequently, the presence of TiO 2  NPs in air, water, soil, and other environmental media has gradually increased due to their widespread use. 3  This growing application and contamination have made human and animal exposure to TiO 2  NPs unavoidable. Apart from skin exposure, inhalation, and oral exposure, other routes of exposure to TiO 2  NPs include intraperitoneal injection, subcutaneous injection, and intramuscular injection. 4  Importantly, regardless of the route of exposure, TiO 2  NPs can ultimately enter the systemic circulation and translocate to various tissues and organs ( Figure 2 ). 4  As the accumulation of TiO 2  NPs in the body increases, the associated health hazards become more severe. 5 \n Figure 1 Application of TiO 2  NPs. \n Figure 2 TiO 2  NPs can enter the human body through different ways and accumulate in the body, posing a threat to human health.\n\nApplication of TiO 2  NPs.\n\nTiO 2  NPs can enter the human body through different ways and accumulate in the body, posing a threat to human health.\n\nBefore the rise of nanotechnology, TiO 2  was widely used in the form of fine particles (FPs), which were considered as poor soluble and low toxicity particles. 6  However, some studies have contradicted this view, such as lung tumors in rats exposed to high levels of TiO 2  FPs for two years. 7  Furthermore, TiO 2  has been classified as a Group 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic to humans) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. 8  Although the specific carcinogenicity of TiO 2  FPs is still debated, there is no doubt that TiO 2  FPs pose a health risk. 9  Compared to TiO 2  FPs, TiO 2  NPs present stronger catalytic activity and bioactivity due to their nanoscale dimensions. 9  Consequently, the toxicity of TiO 2  NPs cannot be solely inferred from the known toxicology of TiO 2  FPs, nor can it be determined using conventional methods. 10  In recent years, extensive exploration of the effects of TiO 2  NPs exposure on human health also reflects the high concern about the safety of TiO 2  NPs. In addition to considering all relevant exposure scenarios and biological intermediate steps, understanding the final toxic outcome is critical for human health risk assessment. 11  Results from another child cohort study in China indicated that Ti can cross the placental barrier (PB) to harm fetuses that are extremely sensitive to environmental threats. 12  Several epidemiological studies have confirmed that Ti exposure increases the risk of adverse birth outcomes, including neural tube defects, preterm birth, fetal distress, and low birth weight. 13–15  Moreover, TiO 2  NP exposure can have detrimental effects on the health of the population beyond the fetus. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggests that higher levels of urinary or blood Ti are associated with an increased risk of various adverse health effects, including diabetes and cardiopulmonary disorders ( Figure 2 ). 16–19  In recent years, laboratory studies on the toxicity of TiO 2  NPs have surpassed epidemiological studies. Common animal models such as mice, rats, zebrafish, and  Drosophila  have been used to study TiO 2  NPs. In vivo, studies have shown that TiO 2  NPs exposure may be linked to lung inflammation, pneumoconiosis, cardiovascular disease, reproductive toxicity, retinal impairments, etc. 20–24  In vitro, studies have also supported these toxic effects of TiO 2  NPs. 25–28  Given that nanoparticles can enter the brain, concerns regarding their neurotoxic effects, including those of TiO 2  NPs, have gained significant attention. 29\n\nThe entry of TiO 2  NPs into the brain mainly occurs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), via absorption-mediated transversion or intranasal pathways. 30 , 31  However, the mechanisms by which nano-titanium dioxide penetrates and targets different brain regions remain unknown. The degree of TiO 2  NPs accumulation in each brain region closely correlates with the extent of neurotoxic effects. Common neurotoxic effects include behavior deficits, nervous system dysfunction, and structural changes induced by oxidative stress, autophagy, inflammation, or the activation of specific signaling pathways. 32  Although emerging studies support the role of TiO 2  NPs exposure as an environmental risk factor for human health, conscientious and systematic investigations are scarce into the extent of TiO 2  NPs translocation to different brain regions and the resulting damage to the neuronal system in relation to particle dose and particle size. The lack of information on the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs also complicates risk assessment following exposure. Therefore, this paper will mainly focus on current studies concerning the neurotoxicology of TiO 2  NPs, while also reviewing the molecular mechanisms underlying their neurotoxic effects to mitigate potential damage resulting from exposure.\n\n## Evidence from Epidemiological and Human Exposure Studies\n\nIn earlier years, population exposure to TiO 2  NPs was primarily investigated among occupational populations. Welding fumes, industrial waste combustion, and mineral mining can all result in environmental contamination by TiO 2  NPs, thereby increasing the exposure risk for workers. 33  Exposure to fumes from metal-inert gas soldering has been found to increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD). 34  Although these fumes mainly consist of zinc, copper, and iron, Andujar et al discovered an excessive accumulation of Ti in the lung tissue sections of welders in 2014. 35  Industrial waste, pesticides, and automobile exhaust are common sources of environmental pollutants associated with neurotoxic effects. 36  Among various environmental pollutants, NPs can easily penetrate the BBB and induce neurotoxicity by activating innate immune responses in astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. 36  TiO 2  NPs are a major component among environmental pollutants, with up to 760 tons of TiO 2  NPs being released into the soil through sewage and sludge each year. 37 , 38  Currently, there is no direct evidence of neurotoxic effects caused by TiO 2  NPs exposure in mineral miners, but a previous study suggested a significantly increased inflammatory response in mineral miners exposed to TiO 2  NPs. 39  It is well known that the occurrence of inflammatory reactions in other organs is closely related to nervous system damage. 40  With the increasing application of TiO 2  NPs, concerns have also arisen regarding the neurotoxic effects of non-occupational populations exposed to TiO 2  NPs. A recent cohort study demonstrated that high levels of urinary Ti during pregnancy were significantly associated with impaired language development, suggesting that TiO 2  NPs might act as developmental neurotoxicants. 41  Furthermore, elevated levels of Ti in maternal hair were also significantly associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects. 42  However, epidemiological studies on the neurotoxic effects caused by TiO 2  NPs are still limited. Currently, laboratory studies are the main basis for evaluating the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs.\n\n## Literature Search\n\nTo review the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using the “Pubmed” database, covering articles from 1991 to September 29, 2023. The search utilized combinations of the following keywords: Titanium dioxide nanoparticles exposure; E171 exposure; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles neuron; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles brain; Titanium dioxide nanoparticles behavior; and Titanium dioxide nanoparticles neurotoxicology. Our search strategy involved an initial screening of all titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text review of the pertinent review articles. One hundred forty-seven papers were selected, including one hundred twenty-one research papers. Citations within twenty-six reviews were also screened for additional studies not identified in the electronic search; however, no additional research papers were found through these references. In the end, a total of one hundred and twenty-one research papers were selected, all of which included neurotoxicity endpoints in their experimental designs.\n\nFor experimental research, we identified in vitro or in vivo studies involving the administration of TiO 2  NPs. The researched organism groups mainly consisted of rodents, zebrafish, and cells. Fifty-five studies were conducted on rodents, twenty on zebrafish, and two on  Caenorhabditis elegans  ( C. elegans ), while one each on  Pheretima hawayana, Tegillarca granosa , and  Drosophila melanogaster . Additionally, forty-one studies used in vitro cells, including various animals and human-derived neuronal cells ( Figure 3 ).\n Figure 3 Study selection flow diagram.

Among these, 23 articles focused on rat models, with the Wistar rat being the most commonly employed. The exposed TiO 2  NPs generally had a particle size of less than 20 nm, and the exposure doses ranged below 200 mg/kg ( Table 1 ). Intratracheal instillation, intragastric administration, intravenous injection, and intraperitoneal injection are common methods of rat exposure to TiO 2  NPs. Pregnancy and lactation have been identified as critical periods of neurodevelopment and have been selected as exposure windows to toxicants in many neurotoxicological studies, including the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs. 43–45  Exposure to TiO 2  NPs (10 nm, 100 mg/kg) during pregnancy or lactation has been found to impair memory and learning in Wistar offspring rats by reducing hippocampal cell proliferation. 44 , 46  Prenatal exposure to TiO 2  NPs (5 nm, 1 μg/μL) via subcutaneous injection has been shown to enhance depressive-like behavior in adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. 47  Additionally, Engler-Chiurazzi et al conducted locomotion, learning, and anxiety tests on male adult SD rats and observed significant cognitive impairments in offspring resulting from inhalation exposure to TiO 2  NPs (170.9 ± 6.4 nm, 10.4 ± 0.4 mg/m 3 ) during pregnancy. 48  In earlier studies, the roles of age and sex in early-life exposure at different developmental stages were often overlooked. However, a recent study demonstrated that female pups were more susceptible to adverse outcomes after early exposure to oral TiO 2  NPs (postnatal day, PND 2–5 or PND 7–10) compared to male pups, while male pups exhibited more severe motor deficits following exposure to nano-titanium dioxide during late lactation (PND 17–20). 45  The behavioral impairments resulting from TiO 2  NPs exposure during pregnancy and lactation involve multiple mechanisms, including oxidative damage, changes in neurotransmitter concentrations, and metabolic disturbances. 45 , 47  Furthermore, exposure to TiO 2  NPs during pregnancy has been associated with neuronal apoptosis, decreased neurogenesis, altered expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and impaired synaptic plasticity. 49–51 \n Table 1 Overview of Literature Investigating Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Rats Model System Particle Size Exposure Method Exposure Time Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

Among them, 21 studies used ICR mice, 7 studies used C57BL/6, 2 studies used Albino mice, while BALB/c mice and Swiss Webster mice were used in 1 study each ( Table 2 ). The exposure methods used in most of the neurotoxicological studies of TiO 2  NPs using mice as animal models mimic the actual pathways of human exposure to TiO 2  NPs. TiO 2  NPs can enter the human body via intentional or unintentional inhalation; therefore, intranasal administration was chosen as the exposure method in 10 studies. Intranasal drug administration is a promising method to bypass BBB, resulting in higher bioavailability and greater brain exposure compared to oral administration at the same dose. 71  Several studies have shown that intranasal administration of TiO 2  NPs in mice resulted in various neurological damages, including hippocampal cell apoptosis, tissue necrosis, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, imbalance of glutamate metabolism, and altered gene expression. 72–79  These structural and functional impairments in the nervous system are closely related to behavioral deficits. Ze et al found that exposure to TiO 2  NPs (208–330 nm, 2.5 mg/kg body weight, BW) for 90 consecutive days via intranasal administration damaged the hippocampus structure, decreased long-term potentiation, altered gene expression, and caused spatial recognition deficits. 80  Intragastric administration, a method commonly used to assess the effects of oral exposure in the hazard assessment of environmental toxicants, was employed in 13 neurotoxicological studies of TiO 2  NPs using mice as animal models. 81  Pregnancy exposure to TiO 2  NPs (21 nm, 150 mg/kg) via intragastric administration caused the delayed appearance of neurobehavioral impairments in both dams and offspring, which may be related to disruption of the gut-brain axis. 82 , 83  Furthermore, exposure to low levels of TiO 2  NPs (6.5 nm, < 5 mg/kg) via intragastric administration during pregnancy and lactation retarded axonal and dendritic outgrowth, impaired cognitive ability, and increased hippocampal neurons apoptosis. 84–86  In addition to common impairments in the nervous system associated with TiO 2  NPs exposure, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and altered gene expression, Wang et al found that exposure to TiO 2  NPs (10 nm) increased the risk of PD. 87 \n Table 2 Overview of the Literature Investigating Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Mice Model System Particle Size Exposure Method Exposure Time Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

Among the 11 studies, 8 studies selected the embryonic stage of zebrafish for TiO 2  NPs exposure, 2 studies selected adult zebrafish, and one study selected zebrafish larvae. The most commonly used dose of TiO 2  NPs in studies involving co-exposure to other compounds was 100 μg/L. So far, TiO 2  NPs have been shown to enhance Pb, 106 , 107  decabromodiphenyl oxide (BDE-209), 108  cypermethrin, 109  triphenyl phosphate, 110  bisphenol A, 111 , 112  difenoconazole, 113  tetracycline, 114  and microcystin-LR 115  -induced neurotoxicity. TiO 2  NPs mainly enhance the neurotoxicity of these compounds by increasing their bioconcentration and bioavailability in zebrafish. Interestingly, co-exposure with TiO 2  NPs did not alter pentachlorophenol-induced neurotoxicity. 116 \n Table 3 Overview of Literature Investigating Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Zebrafish Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

The embryonic stage of zebrafish is the most commonly used exposure stage for TiO 2  NPs exposure models, which may be attributed to the incomplete development of the BBB during this period. 126  TiO 2  NPs exposure during the embryonic stage of zebrafish significantly alters motor behavior, social behavior, and spatial recognition memory. 117–120  In addition to behavioral impairments, TiO 2  NPs exposure causes oxidative stress, promotes neuronal proliferation, decreases motor neuron axon length, alters gene expression, and increases cell apoptosis. 120–123  Two study chose the adult stage of zebrafish for TiO 2  NPs exposure, and their results suggested that TiO 2  NPs exposure caused cognitive deficit, promoted neuroinflammation, and altered biochemical constituents of the brain. 124 , 125\n\n## Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Other Animal Models\n\nIn vivo, studies investigating the potential neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs exposure on animals other than rodents and zebrafish are relatively scarce. To date, only five studies investigated the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs exposure in other animal models, namely  C. elegans, Tegillarca granosa, Pheretima hawayana , and  Drosophila  melanogaster ( Table 4 ).\n Table 4 Overview of the Literature Investigating Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Other Animal Models Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

Its small size, short life cycle, and high reproductive rate make  C. elegans  an advantageous model in neuroscience. 132  Long-term exposure to TiO 2  NPs (10 nm) resulted in severe defects in the development of AVL and DVB neurons that control defecation in nematodes. 127  Neurons exposed to both anatase and rutile TiO 2  NPs exhibited shorter axon growth, which may be the reason for defective locomotion behavior in nematodes. 128\n\nDrosophila melanogaster  is an excellent animal model for evaluating the neurotoxicity of various NPs due to its low-cost, physiological similarities to humans, and well-known behavioral and developmental characteristics. 133 , 134  The results of a recent study indicated that chronic exposure to TiO 2  NPs (approximately 20 nm, 20 mg/kg) induced deficits in motor behavior by disrupting the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila. 129\n\nTegillarca granosa  and  Pheretima hawayana  are rarely studied in neurotoxicological research involving NPs.  Tegillarca granosa  inhabits intertidal mudflat, where the concentration of NPs is predicted to be higher than in other parts of the ocean. 135  Selecting  Tegillarca granosa  as an animal model provides better insights into the neurotoxicity of NPs in marine bivalve mollusks. 130  Exposure to TiO 2  NPs (200 nm) increased neurotransmitters concentrations, suppressed the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and decreased the expression of neurotransmitter-related genes, which may disrupt various physiological processes in  Tegillarca granosa . 130  While TiO 2  NPs are increasingly being released into the soil, their effects on soil biota remain largely unknown. 136  The traditional sentinel species for soil toxicity testing is the earthworm, and  Pheretima hawayana  is a species of Egyptian earthworm. Exposure to TiO 2  NPs altered biochemical indices related to the function of the nervous system, such as inhibiting AChE, increasing antioxidant enzymes, and accumulating malondialdehyde (MDA). 131\n\n## Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in vitro Models\n\nIn vitro models are widely used to assess neurotoxic effects on cellular functions. 137  Several studies have evaluated the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs using in vitro models. Primary hippocampal and cortical neurons are widely used in vitro models for neurotoxicology testing as they are easily polarized and form unique axons and dendrites. In addition, these models are used to study neuronal polarization, axon/dendrite morphology, synaptic formation, and central nervous system (CNS) functions. 138  Exposure to TiO 2  NPs impairs neuronal function, inhibits neuroblast proliferation, reduces cell viability, and increases cell apoptosis by promoting oxidative stress in both primary hippocampal and cortical neurons. 139–144  Furthermore, TiO 2  NPs inhibit neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons by interfering with glutamate metabolism and impairing N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor function. 145  According to some previous studies, the suppression of axonal development, dendritic development, and synapse development by TiO 2  NPs was associated with decreased expression of axon growth-related factors and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin and BDNF-TrkB pathways. 146–148  See  Table 5  for details.\n Table 5 Overview of the Literature on Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs on Primary Neuron and Nerve Cell Lines Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

PC12 cell line shows morphological and functional differentiation similar to sympathetic neurons. PC12 cell line is a suitable model for studying the chemical disruption of neuronal differentiation, synthesis, storage, and release of neurotransmitters, function and regulation of ion channels, and the interaction of compounds with membrane-bound receptors. 160  A previous study revealed that treatment of PC12 cells with TiO 2  NPs (< 36 nm, < 200 μg/mL) decreased cell viability, increased cell apoptosis via oxidative stress, inhibited the neurite outgrowth, disturbed cell cycle, and disrupted the ubiquitin-proteasome system. 149–151  The human-derived SH-SY5Y cell line is preferred over the PC12 cell line as it avoids interspecific differences in chemical action. 161  The SH-SY5Y cell line is an excellent model for studying toxicity on proliferating or differentiated cells because it can be maintained as neuroblasts or induced to differentiate into more neuron-like morphologies. 161  TiO 2  NPs were shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy, inhibition of cell proliferation, disturbance of the microtubule dynamics, and membrane damage in SH-SY5Y cells. 153–158  Several in vivo studies investigated the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on mouse hippocampus. However, one in vitro study explored the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells. The study revealed that TiO 2  NPs increased apoptosis of HT22 cells via oxidative stress- and calcium imbalance-mediated ER stress. 159\n\nAcute or prolonged exposure to TiO 2  NPs is associated with toxic effects on neuronal and glial cells. 162  Glial cells are critical cells of the nervous system, which serve as tissue-resident macrophages. Microglia are crucial regulators that influence nervous system development, maintenance of the neural environment, and response to injury and repair. 163  The immortalized mouse microglia cell line BV2 is often used as an alternative for primary microglia in cell experiments. Some previous studies showed that exposure of BV2 cells to TiO 2  NPs was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress. 28 , 164  Astrocytes play a key role in innate and adaptive immune responses in CNS injury. 165  Due to advancements in cell culture technology, primary astrocytes have become a common primary cell model. Previous studies revealed that TiO 2  NPs induced mitochondria damage, oxidative stress, autophagy, neuroinflammation, and cell apoptosis in primary rat cortical astrocytes. 166–168  Other studies employed human glial cell lines as in vitro models for neurotoxicity studies to eliminate species differences. Some previous studies revealed that TiO 2  NPs inhibited cell proliferation, induced morphological changes, decreased immuno-location of F-actin fibers, and increased cell apoptosis in U374 cells. 169 , 170  Furthermore, several studies have investigated the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs in a co-culture of glial cells and other cells. For example, Yang et al showed that TiO 2  NPs stimulate the inflammatory reaction in brain microglia and damage neuron using a co-culture model of primary microglia and PC12 cell line. 171  Similarly, TiO 2  NPs was shown to stimulate the inflammatory reaction in brain microglia and damage neurons in co-culture models of BV2 and N27 mesencephalic neurons, and BV2 and N2a neuroblastoma cells. 172 , 173  See  Table 6  for details.\n Table 6 Overview of the Literature on Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Primary Glial Cells and Glial Cell Lines Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on other brain regions. The BBB is effective in protecting the brain from chemical damage. Therefore, there is a need to understand the effects of TiO 2  NP S  on the BBB. A previous study exploring the effects of TiO 2  NPs on an in vitro model of BBB established by co-culturing primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and primary human astrocytes, revealed that TiO 2  NPs increased the permeability of the BBB. 31  Another study showed that acute or long-term exposure of an in vitro model of the BBB established by co-culturing primary rat endothelial cells and glial cells to TiO 2  NPs was associated with BBB dysfunction related to increased inflammatory response and altered expression of the ABC transporter. 174  Moreover, treatment of T98G human glioblastoma cells with TiO 2  NPs was associated with changes in the transcriptome, suggesting that exposure to TiO 2  NPs could compromise BBB integrity and cause neuroinflammation. 175  Furthermore, TiO 2  NPs can be internalized by dorsal root ganglion cells (DRG) and cause damage via apoptosis. 176 , 177  Yu et al showed an association between the toxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on olfactory bulb neuron cells and its pathogenicity to neurodegenerative diseases. 178  Furthermore, exposure to TiO 2  NPs was associated with varying degrees of cytotoxicity to the human cerebral endothelial cell line (HCECs), human neural stem cell line (hNSCs), and neuroectodermal stem cell line (1C11) models. 179–181  See  Table 7  for details.\n Table 7 Overview of the Literature on Neurotoxic Effects of TiO 2  NPs in Other Cells Model System Particle Size Exposure Dose Neurotoxic Effects Ref.

The exposure characteristics, such as exposure dose, method, duration, and species, can influence the toxic effects of TiO 2  NPs in vivo. A review of the literature showed that the exposure dose in vivo and in vitro experiments was larger than the actual exposure dose of the population. According to a previous study, the levels of TiO 2  NPs in air and water ranged from 0.7 to 16 μg/L. 182  It is estimated that children have an intake of TiO 2  NPs of about 2–3 mg/kg/day, while adults have a TiO 2  NPs intake of about 1 mg/kg/day. 2  Human exposure to TiO 2  NPs is mainly through dietary intake and air inhalation. Although the exposure methods selected in animal studies attempted to mimic human exposure closely, there are some gaps. For example, the system for intranasal administration is simple compared to inhalation administration. Furthermore, intranasal administration is significantly affected by the inhalational dose. 183  The intranasal administration volumes in rodents at a given time should be limited to approximately 5 μL per nostril since volumes greater than this are likely to become wasted. 184 , 185  Furthermore, ingested TiO 2  NPs first interacts with the oral mucosa. However, intragastric administration does not interact with the oral mucosa and is thus associated with significant differences in absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism with implications for assumptions and models of toxicity kinetics. 81  In addition, the exposure period and duration also influence the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs. 45 , 94  However, the exposure duration in experiments tends to be shorter than that in humans. Species differences are often unavoidable. Therefore, there is a need to conduct epidemiological studies exploring the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on humans.\n\nFurthermore, the physical and chemical properties of TiO 2  NPs can affect their neurotoxicity. Particle size is key. In general, small particles are more likely to be absorbed and thus exert toxic effects. 186  According to some previous studies, the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs depend on particle size. 60 , 168  The hydrodynamic diameter or secondary particle sizes of TiO 2  NPs are important with respect to neurotoxicity. While smaller NPs may seem more neurotoxic, they are also more likely to clump together and form aggregates. 186  Theoretically, the particle aggregation would increase the effective particle size thus reducing the neurotoxic potential. Several studies have used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the effects of hydrodynamics or secondary particle size of TiO 2  NPs on neurotoxicity. However, no studies have explored the effect of aggregate particle size on the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs. The zeta potential of TiO 2  NPs has also been investigated in most neurotoxicological studies. Since most cell membranes are negatively charged, the zeta potential affects the tendency of NPs to penetrate the membrane, with cationic particles generally exhibiting higher toxicity associated with cell wall damage. 187  Furthermore, the surface charge of the nanoparticles can determine the degree of aggregation. 122 , 162 , 164  However, further studies are needed to investigate whether the zeta potential affects the neurotoxicity of TiO 2  NPs. In addition, the toxicity of TiO 2  NPs is dependent on crystalline phases. The anatase form of TiO 2  NPs is more neurotoxic than that of rutile TiO 2  NPs and P25 TiO 2  NPs since anatase has a higher ability to induce oxidative stress. 152 , 166 , 188\n\nTaken together, various factors can affect the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs, including physical and chemical properties of TiO 2  NPs, and exposure dose, exposure duration, exposed species. However, the specific effects of these factors on the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs still need to be systematically compared.\n\n## Reflections on Neurotoxicity Induced by TiO 2  NPs\n\nMost studies to date have focused on rodents, and most experimental exposures used are not very realistic for human exposure. In addition, there is currently limited information on the levels of TiO 2  NPs in the environment, consumer goods, and food products. For humans, more accurate monitoring is needed to determine daily exposure levels, particle characteristics and exposure route, all of which affect the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs. Evaluating and availing data on TiO 2  NPs levels in different environmental media helps to reliably estimate human exposure and thus assess the risk of TiO 2  NPs. Furthermore, the degree of uptake through the digestive system, respiratory system, potential BBB crossing, and potential translocation to or even accumulation in nervous system should be further investigated. This information will indicate which route of exposure mitigation is most valuable for human health protection. However, apart from the recommended exposure limits (REL) established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), no other regulatory agencies have set occupational or environmental exposure limits for TiO 2  NPs. 9  There are limitations in the monitoring methods of TiO 2  NPs. There is an urgent need to develop appropriate methods for reducing TiO 2  NPs in environmental media and food to prevent their potentially harmful health effects. 189\n\nThe specific mechanisms behind the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs have only been explored through animal and cell experiments. TiO 2  NPs increase the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain, thus inducing oxidative stress. Ze et al reported that TiO 2  NPs induced oxidative stress thus causing brain damage through overactivation of the p38-Nrf-2 signaling pathway. 78  Oxidative stress can induce neuroinflammation, thus further aggravating cell damage. 63 , 73 , 92  Cell damage, including structural and functional damage, is associated with increased onset and development of neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and PD. 87 , 100  Cell damage is also linked to behavioral deficits. 46 , 57  Abnormal motor ability could be caused by a decrease in the axon length of motor neurons. 120  In addition, changes in hippocampal synaptic plasticity could lead to decreased spatial recognition. 80  The development of axons, dendrites and synapses is regulated by various signaling pathways. TiO 2  NPs impair the growth of axons and dendrites through excessive activation of the ERK1/2/MAPK signaling pathway. 84  In addition, impairment of dendritic growth by TiO 2  NPs is also related to inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. 147  Moreover, suppression of the neuronal synaptic outgrowth by TiO 2  NPs is linked to the inhibition of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. 148  Furthermore, the accumulation of TiO 2  NPs in the brain could cause alterations in brain biochemistry and changes in neurotransmitter levels, contributing to behavioral changes. 45 , 57 , 117  Although all of these studies confirm that TiO 2  NPs cause neurotoxic effects through different mechanisms, most of the evidence on the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs is fragmentary and is obtained from different species. Furthermore, few of these mechanism studies have explored whether the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs are mediated through synergistic interactions of multiple brain regions, organs, and systems. Whether TiO 2  NPs with different characteristics cause different degrees of toxic effects through different mechanisms remains be further explored. Extensive systematic studies are needed to fully elucidate the neurotoxic mechanisms of TiO 2  NPs, which will be helpful for the prevention and treatment of neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnimals and humans can be exposed to TiO 2  NPs through different exposure pathways, thus posing health hazards. At present, the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs have only been evaluated through animal models, including rats, mice, and zebrafish, and cell studies, including primary neurons, PC12, and SH-SY5Y cell lines. TiO 2  NPs can induce oxidative stress, promote neuroinflammation, alter brain biochemistry, or damage neurons. Neuronal damage can further lead to various behavioral disorders and is closely associated with increased onset and development of neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases. However, due to the lack of relevant epidemiological studies, whether TiO 2  NPs are linked to neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases in humans remains unknown. Furthermore, the neurotoxic potential of TiO 2  NPs can be affected by various factors. There is a need for researchers to understand the neurotoxic effects of TiO 2  NPs on humans and develop strategies for mitigating the effects of TiO 2  NPs on human health.",
